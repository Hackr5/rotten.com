<b>Q.</b>
</font>

Where do you get your pictures?

<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=gray>
<b>A.</b>
</font>

Everywhere! People send them to us, sometimes we buy them,
people hunt for pictures for us, and also we acquire reference 
materials that contain them. Occasionally, we will even
take pictures ourselves.

<p>
<hr width=40%>
<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=red>
<b>Q.</b>
</font>

Are they real?

<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=gray>
<b>A.</b>
</font>

Yes, the pictures that appear to be dead bodies are in fact
real. If a picture is represented as humor, such as the "Circular
File" exhibit, then anything goes. We see a lot of fake pictures,
and can spot them fairly easily. Real pictures of this nature 
aren't particularly rare; they are merely hidden from the 
public in most cases.

<b>Q.</b>
</font>

When did you start Rotten?

<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=gray>
<b>A.</b>
</font>

In late 1996, I wrote a program to spit out all Internet 
domain names that weren't registered yet but were in the dictionary. 
This one was one of about a dozen generic words that I took, and 
the site actually started as a "what should I do with this domain 
now that I blew a hundred bucks on it" exercise.

<b>Q.</b>
</font>

Why do you do it?

<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=gray>
<b>A.</b>
</font>

Our staff loves to upset people, it keeps our stools regular.
Since the site has actually acquired a life of its own, it really
is out of our hands. Well, that's true until we switch to an adult
contemporary music format.

<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=red>
<b>Q.</b>
</font>

Aren't you ashamed?

<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=gray>
<b>A.</b>
</font>

No, not really. We don't really show anything that the major 
television networks don't show you, it's just a matter of degree.
Perhaps when CNN admits its shame, so will we. They make a fortune
on the misery of fellow man, and few complain about that.

<b>Q.</b>
</font>

You are going to burn in hell.

<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=gray>
<b>A.</b>
</font>

God I hope so, I couldn't stand another hour of peaceful 
contemplation accompanied by insipid harp playing. But there 
isn't any part of the Bible that has anything to say about 
running this kind of website. People tell us this, we ask 
them to find supporting verses (we will even let them use 
Old Testament fire and brimstone) and then we never hear from 
that person again. Because, there simply are 
<i>no</i> Bible passages to support this viewpoint. 

<p>
<hr width=40%>
<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=red>
<b>Q.</b>
</font>

Oh I love your site but I'm offended by a particular picture.
Please take it down.

<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=gray>
<b>A.</b>
</font>

Different people have different triggers, so we will often
receive a complaint like this. Well, many of our pictures receive 
complaints like this; honoring them all would make us boring. If you 
send us such a message, it isn't likely we will listen to you. Just move along.

<p>
<hr width=40%>
<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=red>
<b>Q.</b>
</font>

Do people claim to find people they know in pictures?

<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=gray>
<b>A.</b>
</font>

Yes, from time to time that happens. Sometimes we know exactly where
a picture came from, and someone in a totally different place will claim
that a particular picture is a relative. In fact multiple people have
claimed to know the circumstances of the exact same picture, and this is
of course nuts. If you see someone you think you know, it is highly 
likely that it isn't that person.

<b>Q.</b>
</font>

What's the story behind that "Motorcycle" pic?

<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=gray>
<b>A.</b>
</font>

We have to admit the "motorcycle" pic has caused a lot of email, it
being one of the most disconcerting things people have ever seen. We
called it "Motorcycle" because it arrived as motorcycle.jpg, but it is
more likely an attempted shotgun suicide. The man lived. An attorney
wrote us demanding that we take the picture down, but was unable to provide
enough details for us to comply with his request.

<b>Q.</b>
</font>

Can't you provide more details about pictures?

<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=gray>
<b>A.</b>
</font>

Often, unfortunately, we can't. When we end up with a police photo,
or whatnot, there is generally no accompanying documentation. It's great
when we do have such information, but because our sources are secretive,
shaky, or even completely anonymous, the best that we can do is just
show the picture. 

<p>
<hr width=40%>
<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=red>
<b>Q.</b>
</font>

Do you ever take stuff down for legal reasons?

<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=gray>
<b>A.</b>
</font>

Yes. If a sufficiently compelling argument is put forward by a
duly licensed attorney, we have been known to remove images. Is that selling
out? Maybe. It just isn't worth fighting most battles, particularly with
Goliath corporations. We'll just put up different pictures. Any demand to
remove pictures had better have at least some merit though; we haven't 
removed all pictures or features that have been demanded of us.

<b>Q.</b>
</font>

Why aren't you in jail already?

<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=gray>
<b>A.</b>
</font>

The founding fathers of the United States had the foresight to provide us
with loopholes to excuse our bad behavior. By not violating any criminal codes,
somehow, we manage to stay out of jail.

<p>

<b>A.</b>
</font>

You can email digital pictures to <a href="mailto:images@rotten.com">
publicity@rotten.com</a>. High quality JPG's are the preferred format, but
any format will be taken if necessary. If you have original pictures or
materials to send: Rotten.com, PO Box 4436, Mountain View CA, 94040, USA.
We love receiving your weird photos, zines, or artwork in the snail mail. 
Good stuff gets a tshirt in return; mediocre stuff gets laughed at!

I have been to your web site a few times and I don't see how you can do
that to people who have passed on, especially children!  I think the
elephantis and things that people may have never seen like that are
pretty nasty but interesting none the less.  I think what you are doing
is horrible how could you show these dead bodies "no" how dare you show
these dead bodies.  Why are you showing them for people to have a good
laugh or for people to get grossed out.  I accidentally came across the
dead child photo and it almost brought me to tears.  My sister in law
showed me, before I could reject, the picture of the dead child with his
jaw ripped off, I lost sleep for three days not only because of what
happened to that poor child but that some sick person would publicise
something like that.   I hope you realize what you are doing is wrong
before you meet your maker, he may not be very forgiving of this.

Hello! Obviously you in the photography section do not know what in the 
hell you are taking pictures of. The President was giving the sign of "I 
Love You". If you ask any intelligent person who has ever studied American 
Sign Language to any degree will tell you that it is no the sign of satan.  
It is "I Love You". The sign of satan requires that the thumb be tucked.  
If you will notice in you carefully taken photo, it is sticking out! This 
otherwise is an awsome site and I visit often and refer friends to it. I 
realize you must have had a brain-fart. I happen to be fluent in sign
language by the way.

<p>
<font size=5 face="arial, helvetica" color=gray>

We've received many dozens of complaints from sign language

I was wondering how on earth your site hasn't been banned, and how on earth 
you people sleep at night knowing that your opening giving the world access 
to this brutal imagery you have on display.  What you are showing is quite 
blatantly illegal.  I guess you people are intelligent as I understand this 
site has been around for some time and until now you have gotten yourselves 
out of trouble when neccessary.  I feel I should warn you that I intend to 
investigate ways in which I can help have this site closed down.  The problem 
is that anyone could stumble across this site accidently, like I did, and 
that includes kids, and besides anyone who takes pleasure in this depravity 
needs help, which I am sure includes all those involved at your site.  I 
would appreciate a response to this in which I want you to attempt to justify 
your ideas and site content to me.  Fuck you all you cowardly, depraved, 
twisted, evil, thoughtless, incompassionate monsters.

Our content is clearly labelled for what it is -- and this is not 
required under *any* U.S. law, nor can it be  -- and also, we don't have
any pictures on our main page, also not required by law. If you go to
our page and click on a link, it's your fault, you asked to see it.

Now as to the fact that you don't like the pages, I'm sorry. It is not
a crime. We still do have the 1st amendment. These pictures aren't any
different than what you see in mainstream media, just we show you a
lot of them at once. So while we will continue to wallow in our depravity, 
you'll just have to lie awake nights. Oh well! Cheers.

Hi, I just wanted to ask you obviously very sick, thoughtless human beings 
whether God plays a role in your life at all. The immoral, sick, 
disgusting, corruptive, horrible, sinful, evil stuff that you put up for all 
to see shows me the horror that exists within the human mind. Do you not 
want something better for yourselves? You are all human beings and every 
pathetic move and action that you make is viewed by some beautiful being 
that put us here. Why would you create something as horrible as your website 
and let other human beings have access to it when you very well should know 
what a vulnerable existance we have? Anything bad can pollute and influence 
and corrupt and hurt us. This is the existance that we have created for 
ourselves but it is not the existance God wants us to live. He wants us to 
be happy, to show love and kindness to one another, to help one another out 
whenever we can, and what you're doing is sick and disturbing and only takes 
human existance further and further away from He who had put us here. This 
world and existance is not ours, so please be more kind and loving and 
respectful with your actions. A site called www.rotten.com with all its sick 
horrors should not exist. Please get rid of it and start spreading LOVE and 
beauty with all that you do. Thank you and remember, God loves you so please 
try and make Him proud of us and worthy of having been brought into 
existance.  And don't forget....you have been touched by an angel.

This truly does bring a tear to my eye. In fact I am reminded this
moment of Psalm 137:8, <i>"O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is
he who repays you for what you have done to us - he who seizes your 
infants and dashes their brains against the rocks."</i>  
Rejoice in the Lord.
