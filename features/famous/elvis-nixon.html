On 21 December 1970, Elvis Presley paid a visit to President Richard M Nixon 
at the White House in Washington, D.C. The meeting was initiated by Presley, 
who wrote Nixon a six-page letter requesting a visit with the President and 
suggesting that he be made a "Federal Agent-at-Large" in the Bureau of Narcotics 
and Dangerous Drugs. During this meeting at the Oval Office, Presley presented 
Nixon with a Colt 45 pistol, and this famous photo was taken.
