<li><b>December 15, 2001</b>.<br>
For the first time ever, you can <a href="/search/">search</a> the site.
<p>

<li><b>November 28, 2001</b>.<br>
Daily Rotten and Rotten News have been merged together as the <a href="http://www.dailyrotten.com/">
Daily Rotten</a>. Exactly how this merger will end up is still confusing even to us,
but there will be new and interesting features to the site added in the future to augment this.
<p>

<li><b>November 16, 2001</b>.<br>
Our <a href="http://www.dailyrotten.com/articles/archive/159929.html">story</a>
about the Taliban's nuclear secrets turned into international news, which was covered by
The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, London Telegraph, and Time Magazine, among 
others.
<p>

<li><b>October 2, 2001</b>.<br>
The <a href="../press/">Press Clippings</a> have been updated, though there are a number
of stories that seem to have been misplaced. Also, the <a href="http://fotm.rotten.com/fotm/">
Fuck of the Month</a> has been updated. It's a bit behind, so just to be infuriating 
updates will appear once per day until it is current. Who loves ya, baby.
<p>

<li><b>September 11, 2001</b>.<br>
The World Trade Center twin towers were destroyed today. Therefore a feature that 
we had been preparing prior to this, <a href="../news/">Rotten News and Intelligencer</a>, 
gets inaugurated several weeks early. If you just catch news from the major networks, this
feature may open your eyes somewhat. Updated frequently.
<p>

<li><b>September 1, 2001</b>.<br>
The main page of rotten.com has been getting updated several times a week for the past
month or so, and we have not been placing notices in this "new" log to reduce its noise level.
<p>

<li><b>August 1, 2001</b>.<br>
Some graphic prison violence photos from <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/carandiru/">
Carandiru</a>, perhaps the most notorious prison in Brazil.
<p>

<li><b>July 30, 2001</b>.<br>
<a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/pipebomb/">Pipe Bomb</a> and 
<a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/maggots/">Maggots Ate My Piranha</a>.
<p>

<li><b>July 19, 2001</b>.<br>
The Brazilian <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/crash/">Ferrari Crash</a>.
<p>

<li><b>July 4, 2001</b>.<br>
As is customary at rotten.com on every July 4th, we bring you 
<a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/july4th2001/">Porn on the Fourth of July</a>.
There's something here for everyone, maybe. Certainly it is nothing that
the Founding Fathers envisioned.
<p>

<li><b>May 21, 2001</b>.<br>
A new <a href="http://fotm.rotten.com/fotm/">Fuck of the Month</a>.
<p>

<li><b>May 16, 2001</b>.<br>
Graphic photo of a <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/protester/">protester</a> that was
fired on point blank by Indonesian police, which is not something we see every day.
<p>

<li><b>May 1, 2001</b>.<br>
The <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/bisection/">Train Bisection</a> is perhaps the
pinnacle of achivement in the field of train-snuff. Alas there is no award for
this.
<p>

<li><b>April 23, 2001</b>.<br>
A nice set of <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/shark/">shark victim photos</a>
sent to us from Australia.
<p>

<li><b>April 14, 2001</b>.<br>
Tragically, Easter has been <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/easter/">cancelled</a>.
<p>

<li><b>April 11, 2001</b>.<br>
This <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/powerline/">man</a> was caught fried
when trying to steal a powerline to sell for scrap. In the daring drama of man vs.
scrap metal: man 0, scrapmetal 1
<p>

<li><b>April 7, 2001</b>.<br>
The first <a href="http://fotm.rotten.com/fotm/">Fuck of the Month</a> 
for April has been chosen.
<p>

<li><b>April 5, 2001</b>.<br>
Ladies, size really does matter, but you knew that. 
<a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/micropenis/">Micropenis!</a>
<p>

<li><b>April 3, 2001</b>.<br>
Long left in someone's desk drawer, <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/poliz1/">
Police Photos #1</a>.
<p>

<li><b>March 29, 2001</b>.<br>
The <a href="http://fotm.rotten.com/fotm/">Fuck of the Month</a> is up to date again.
<p>

<li><b>March 22, 2001</b>.<br>
Life can be <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/spiral/">rough</a> in New York City.
<p>

<li><b>March 18, 2001</b>.<br>
Recently <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/borneo/">massacres in Borneo</a> plague
the South Pacific. With so many massacres these days, and the media attention focused
on the wacky antics of the Taleban, this event has been underreported.
<p>

<li><b>March 5, 2001</b>.<br>
This <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/hang4ever/">poor soul</a> had the misfortune
of hanging where no one was around to find him. Perhaps not the best way to go.
<p>

<li><b>February 28, 2001</b>.<br>
Highly explicit <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/axis/">propaganda</a>. Lick the Axis.
<p>

<li><b>February 21, 2001</b>.<br>
We're being investigated by the FBI <i>and</i> Scotland Yard. It's so fucking 
stupid. Read about it in the latest <a href="http://www.gapingmaw.com/">Gaping Maw</a>.
<p>

<li><b>January 25, 2001</b>.<br>
New <a href="http://fotm.rotten.com/fotm/">Fucks of the Month</a>! Everyone was getting
so tired of "Limberoni" anyway, talented as he is. It's so hard finding a fuck that hasn't
been around the block a few too many times.
<p>

<li><b>January 22, 2001</b>.<br>
A decapitated tribute to poet <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/kipling/">Rudyard Kipling</a>.
<p>

<li><b>January 14, 2001</b>.<br>
Photos of what may be comedian Chris Farley. [His family has requested removal of these;
they are offline temporarily until our attorney reviews the issue]
<p>

<li><b>January 10, 2001</b>.<br>
A new recurring feature, <a href="http://wall.rotten.com/">Viewer Wall</a>, showing
approximately one new picture a day, and this time we mean it.
<p>

<li><b>January 7, 2001</b>.<br>
At least we don't show pictures of <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/infantiphagia/">
people eating babies</a>. Of course the consumption of infants has an intereresting
history, exemplified by Swift's<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/lit/swift.html">
paper</a> on the subject.
<p>

<li><b>December 25, 2000</b>.<br>
Christmas is here, and to most of us that means 
raunchy pornography. For those of us not celebrating the Lord's Birthday with masturbatory
delight, we wish you a <i>Happy Festivus</i>. [offline]
<p>

<li><b>December 13, 2000</b>.<br>
We've updated the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/press/">press</a> clippings section, to include
various mentions of rotten.com in print publications. It is by no means complete, as often only one
person supplies us with a copy of whatever was printed, so we expect a lot of them have been
overlooked. If you find old articles mentioning us that we don't have, let us know!
<p>

<li><b>December 11, 2000</b>.<br>
Our Japanese correspondent has sent us <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/fecaljapan/">Fecal Japan</a>,
which is really a bit more than we wanted to see. 
<p>

<li><b>December 7, 2000</b>.<br>
A new <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/mayhem6/">Mayhem #6</a>, for those so inclined.
<p>

<li><b>November 30, 2000</b>.<br>
<a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/tumor/">Tumor Man</a>, and yes, it is real and he is alive.
<p>

<li><b>November 24, 2000</b>.<br>
Don't forget to <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/penis/">Say It With Penis</a>.
<p>

<li><b>November 22, 2000</b>.<br>
The <a href="http://www.fuQQer.com/fotm/">Fuck of the Month</a>, is now current to October. More coming soon.
<p>

<li><b>November 20, 2000</b>.<br>
Happy <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/thanksgiving/">Thanksgiving</a>, perverts.
<p>

<li><b>November 15, 2000</b>.<br>
Some <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/israel/">Israeli soldiers</a> killed in
recent <i>Intifada</i> uprisings.
<p>

<li><b>October 26, 2000</b>.<br>
Halloween Porn! Boo! [offline now, it's well past H-day]
<p>

<li><b>October 20, 2000</b>.<br>
The
<a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/burnt/">Burnt Crispy Person</a>
hot off a detective's desk. Our posting of these pictures actually made the
newspapers and TV in Harris County. Oopsie!
<p>

<li><b>September 27, 2000</b>.<br>
The
<a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/mousetrap/">Mousetrap Genital Circus</a>
is now playing a limited engagement.
<p>

<li><b>September 14, 2000</b>.<br>
The 2000 Olympics will be opening shortly. A quick
<a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/olympic/">salute</a>.
<p>

<li><b>September 4, 2000</b>.<br>
Not enough people were offended by our last exhibit. Hence, 
<a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/childhood/">Misplaced Childhood</a>
is offered for your disapproval.
<p>

<li><b>August 29, 2000</b>.<br>
Perhaps our lamest exhibit ever, <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/priceless/">
Priceless</a>, a collection of the Mastercard(TM) parodies that have
been floating around for entirely too long. We will soon hear from their attorneys!
<p>

<li><b>August 23, 2000</b>.<br>
The rather peculiar death of Lisa McPherson, who may or may not have been "held"
in a Church of Scientology facility for 17 days, is graphically displayed with this
series of <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/elron/">autopsy photos</a> recently
made available to the public. Not to malign this fine institution or anything..
<p>

<li><b>August 6, 2000</b>.<br>
First there was the incident with the bird, now it's the alarming 
<a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/fish/">Incident With The Fish</a>. We gotta 
stop having these "incidents".
<p>

<li><b>July 14, 2000</b>.<br>
And <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/motorcycle/">this</a> is perhaps the most 
horrible thing we've ever posted.
<p>

<li><b>July 4, 2000</b>.<br>
Celebrate the <a href="http://wtf.rotten.com/july4th00/">Birth of Our Nation</a>!
<p>

<li><b>June 22, 2000</b>.<br>
Fresh from our summer vacation - <a href="http://noop.rotten.com/formaldehyde/">
Babies in Jars</a>! Our original photos from a visit to a 19th century anatomical curiosity cabinet.
<p>

<li><b>June 19, 2000</b>.<br>
Second <a href="http://www.fuQQer.com/fotm/">Fuck of the Month</a> for June.
<p>

<li><b>June 10, 2000</b>.<br>
People kept sending us these <a href="http://video.rotten.com/snake/">
snake</a> pictures, so here they are.
<p>

<li><b>June 5, 2000</b>.<br>
Happy balloon time with the less fortunate, in 
<a href="http://noop.rotten.com/mayhem5/">Mayhem #5</a>.
<p>

<li><b>June 1, 2000</b>.<br>
Added six new images to the <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/animals/">Animal Wrongness</a>
gallery, and also a <a href="http://www.fuQQer.com/fotm/">June Fuck</a> was selected a couple 
days ago that wasn't mentioned here.
<p>

<li><b>May 25, 2000</b>.<br>
When things in the <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/animals/">animal</a> kingdom go awry.
<p>

<li><b>May 15, 2000</b>.<br>

Fresh springtime <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/mayhem4/">Mayhem #4</a> miscellany.
<p>

<li><b>Mar 13, 2000</b>.<br>
Two new Fucks of the Month for <a href="http://www.fuQQer.com/fotm/">March 2000</a>!
<p>

<li><b>Mar 7, 2000</b>.<br>
<a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/train/">Images</a> from a gruesome pedestrian 
train suicide.
<p>

<li><b>Mar 4, 2000</b>.<br>
A <a href="http://www.dailyrotten.com/cgi-bin/search.pl?query=playboy">picture from</a>
and mention of Rotten.com is on page 22 of the April issue of Playboy magazine. 
Fidel looks pretty good.
<p>

<li><b>Feb 21, 2000</b>.<br>
New <a href="http://www.fuQQer.com/fotm/">Fuck of the Month</a>, and
also some <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/elephtits/">Elephantiasis Mammaria</a>.
<p>

<li><b>Jan 13, 2000</b>.<br>
The <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/doughboy/">doughboy</a> pic,
truly a work of modern art.
<p>

<li><b>Jan 9, 2000</b>.<br>
A gallery of <a href="http://noop.rotten.com/hands1/">severed hands</a>
and whatnot, from an emergency room nurse.
<p>

<li><b>Dec 31, 1999</b>.<br>
The <a href="http://www.fuQQer.com/fotm/">Fuck of the Month</a> has
been made current and fully Y2K compliant. At long last, huzzah huzzah, etc.
<p>

<li><b>Dec 25, 1999</b>.<br>
A new feature, updated almost daily, is our 
<a href="http://www.dailyrotten.com/">Daily Rotten</a>. Feel free
to submit things if you find anything appropriate for it. And yes,
there will be new fucks of the month, very, very shortly. 
<p>

<li><b>Dec 23, 1999</b>.<br>
Our <a href="http://wtf.rotten.com/xmas/">Christmas Card</a> to you,
the loyal viewer!
<p>

<li><b>Dec 19, 1999</b>.<br>
Another experiment, the <a href="http://wtf.rotten.com/wtf/wtf.01/">
Circular File</a>, containing miscellaneous images that didn't fit anywhere
else, or that have been floating around a little bit too long.
It's a steaming pile of poo, basically.
<p>

<li><b>Dec 14, 1999</b>.<br>
Our first experiment with video, the <a href="http://wtf.rotten.com/monkey/">
Stinky Monkey Page</a>, is online.
<p>

<li><b>Oct 21, 1999</b>.<br>
Posted the botched pictures from Allen Lee Davis 
<a href="http://smoke.rotten.com/chair/">execution</a>.
<p>

<li><b>June 2, 1999</b>.<br>
The two latest cease & desist letters are <a href="../legal/">here</a>.
<p>

<li><b>May 3, 1999</b>.<br>
Our largest exhibit yet, the <a href="http://www.CelebrityMorgue.com/">
Celebrity Morgue</a>, is now officially open!
<p>

<li><b>April 15, 1999</b>.<br>
We had to remove the D*****t Hole parodies, after a cease & desist
letter arrived today from United Media. You can read the letter
<a href="http://www.rotten.com/legal/">here</a>.
<p>

<li><b>April 14, 1999</b>.<br>
So the D*****t Hole may be an acquired taste. A lot of people don't
seem to like it, and others have described injuries received after
beholding its humor. But, it did make slashdot a couple days ago (cheap shot), 
and today it's Cruel Site of the Day. Incidentally we are 
preparing a major exhibit, hopefully ready around the weekend.
<p>

<li><b>April 6, 1999</b>.<br>
The D*****t Hole. [now removed] Apparently it's a new low.
<p>

<li><b>March 31, 1999</b>.<br>
A new series of <a href="http://smoke.rotten.com/mayhem3/">Mayhem</a>
pictures, featuring dismemberments and other nastiness.
<p>

<li><b>March 30, 1999</b>.<br>
We've received another cease & desist letter, our fourth. That makes
three in about the last thirty days. Quite insane. These letters are now 
available for viewing at our <a href="../legal/">legal department</a>.
Names have been blotted out, of course.
<p>

<li><b>March 19, 1999</b>.<br>
We've moved our old mugshot gallery to it's own domain, 
<a href="http://www.mugshots.org/">mugshots.org</a>. There are some
new mugshots there, including Bill Gates and Marv Albert, more will follow.
It is linked from the gray region on our front page.
<p>

<li><b>March 11, 1999</b>.<br>
This is your <a href="http://smoke.rotten.com/rat/">rat</a> on drugs.
Any questions?
<p>

<li><b>March 8, 1999</b>.<br>
There's now a <a href="http://dickweed.rotten.com/past/">Past Favorites</a>
section to replace the Archives which were broken. We will be adding more
to this area in a few days, as well as more content which will be available
during nonpeak hours. Bandwidth is still an issue, so please bear with us.
<p>

<li><b>March 3, 1999</b>.<br>
Rotten is mentioned in the 
<a href="http://www.phillynews.com/daily_news/99/Mar/03/local/ELMR03.htm">
Philadelphia Daily News</a>, with several inaccuracies. We do not link to
any gang sites, and prefer to remain gang neutral. Can it be true that 
the bloods site is run by rich white guys in Missouri? Say it ain't so!
<p>

<li><b>February 18, 1999</b>.<br>
Okay enough with the FOTM procrastination. It's been updated,
and February's will be out shortly.
<p>

<li><b>January 26, 1999</b>.<br>
Pictures from the hand reattachment surgery, that was in the news yesterday.
<p>

<li><b>January 23, 1999</b>.<br>
This site has been doing a tremendous amount of traffic, averaging 120,000
visitors daily, generating 1.5 million hits totalling 15GB transfer. PER DAY. 
We've been having trouble with our providers, so today we've moved it into 
a better location, which should be able to grow with our needs. Prior to this,
any time we added a new feature/gallery, we were swamped and unable to serve
all the demand.
<p>

<li><b>December 24, 1998</b>.<br>
Christmas pornography in abundance, for the masses.
<p>

<li><b>October 14, 1998</b>.<br>
New FOTM! And this time it's nasty.
<p>

<li><b>September 11, 1998</b>.<br>
To celebrate the release of the Starr Papers, we've posted the 
"Viva Fidel" picture that we've been saving for just this occasion.
Break out the cigars from the humidor! Break out the interns!
<p>

<li><b>August 31, 1998</b>.<br>
New FOTM for the months of August and September. Yay! Also, our moldy old
hardware has been replaced with shiny new hardware within the past several 
days, which should give us better response time, and less downtime.
<p>

<li><b>July 31, 1998</b>.<br>
Over time people have asked us if we have banners available. Now, we
do: <a href="http://www.rotten.com/banners/">four experimental banners</a>
have been created. Woo hoo!
<p>

<li><b>July 28, 1998</b>.<br>
A new Mayhem Series #2 has been posted, consisting of autopsy snapshots
sent to us anonymously. (We wanted to post them a couple days ago, but were 
having server troubles, again.)
<p>

<li><b>July 24, 1998</b>.<br>
We have been having some problems with our hardware, explaining our
random intermittent downtime. Most of the site is on a sparc2, and it's
running on the edge of what it can do. If you have a faster sparc to 
donate, please let us know. (you won't see us running Microsoft servers.)
Coming tomorrow: never before seen autopsy snapshots.
<p>

<li><b>July 22, 1998</b>.<br>
The "golf gator" pic that is making the rounds, posted.
<p>

<li><b>July 11, 1998</b>.<br>
Fuxen of the months for June #1, June #2 ("the lost episodes"), 
and July #1. Ok people vacation is over.
<p>

<li><b>July 7, 1998</b>.<br>
Tupac Shakur's autopsy photo, from the Las Vegas Municipal Police 
Department, posted. Lots of hate mail from this one.
<p>

<li><b>July 4, 1998</b>.<br>
A wonderful July 4th exhibit, featuring nine examples of the
absolute finest patriotic PORNOGRAPHY. Makes me proud to be an American.
<p>

<li><b>May 18, 1998</b>.<br>
Yes, it's May again. We are running late and the hate mail piles
up when we're this tardy with the monthlies. More gross stuff to follow on
the rest of the site within 48 hours. Promise.
<p>

<li><b>April 14, 1998</b>.<br>
Mayhem and Roadkill Potpourri #1, from Latin America. Much blood.
<p>

<li><b>April 10, 1998</b>.<br>
New FOTM, a little late and a little more palatable than last month's,
which was universally reviled as the most awful thing people had ever 
seen in their lives. Coming soon: more roadkill and murder.
<p>

<li><b>April 3, 1998</b>.<br>
New pictures submitted to us by an E.M.T. are now up. Other E.M.T.'s
are encouraged to send us original pictures, we'll send an unspecified
amount of cash in return, depending on the quality of the pictures.
Names will be kept anonymous, as usual.
<p>

<li><b>April 2, 1998</b>.<br>
We've been having problems with our internet providers, and this is why 
March was pretty slow in the new postings. We have been busy, so April 
will see new things.
<p>

<li><b>April 1, 1998</b>.<br>
Congratulations to Howard Stern on his new Saturday show. 
<p>

<li><b>March 1, 1998</b>.<br>
New F.O.T.M.'s for March (two at once). Brutal.
<p>

<li><b>February 11, 1998</b>.<br>
Two fucks of the month, since it's late (for a good reason, which 
I will not go into.) One of them we've had laying around since the 
Nixon administration.
<p>

<li><b>February 3, 1998</b>.<br>
Brace for El Nino! Also a pointer to the Bill Gates pie incident.
<p>

<li><b>January 24, 1998</b>.<br>
The Incident With The Bird.
<p>

<li><b>January 23, 1998</b>.<br>
We were booted off our primary provider, and have been having problems
with some of our other providers. If you saw a password over the last two
days on one of our areas, that was because of a hardware upgrade -- we
have <b>no plans</b> to charge money or have passwords in the future for 
the awful things we offer here.
<p>

<li><b>January 22, 1998</b>.<br>
More interesting new content will appear over the next couple days, as 
our problems are sorted out. Remember that our pages get 1,000,000 hits per 
day and it is difficult keeping everything running smoothly.
<p>

<li><b>January 5, 1998</b>.<br>
New FOTM, pretty gross.
<p>

<li><b>December 25, 1997</b>.<br>
Online: A picture of Santa as you've never seen him before.
<p>

<li><b>December 18, 1997</b>.<br>
Bikie massacre pictures (Australian motrocycle gangs).
<p>

<li><b>December 14, 1997</b>.<br>
People have been asking about our schedule. We try to put out one major
'feature' per week plus other one-offs sprinkled randomly. It's done as time 
permits, depending on unrelated committments. The Australian "bikie" 
massacre pictures will be the next shown.
<p>
And a new FOTM, still uncouth but not as bad as the last one. 
<p>

<li><b>December 12, 1997</b>.<br>
<a href="http://www.rotten.com/today/">Today in Rotten History</a> now
has a link to yesterday's events.
<p>

<li><b>December 7, 1997</b>.<br>
Posted the first in a series of coroner scrapbook pictures. These
are of a homosexual schoolteacher stabbed in a place where people just
shouldn't be stabbed. Ouch.
<p>

<li><b>December 6, 1997</b>.<br>
We've been shocked to discover that Donald Duck is addicted to heroin.
Everyone in the office is speechless. Examine the evidence for yourself.
<p>

<li><b>December 4, 1997</b>.<br>
Over six million visitors served this year. We are getting over 
1,000,000 hits per day, transferring over 6GB daily. Eep.
<p>

<li><b>December 3, 1997</b>.<br>
New archive image (this one also unpleasant.)
<p>

<li><b>December 1, 1997</b>.<br>
Another month, another fuck. People always complain if it's even one
day late, so this one is on time -- <b>but</b>-- it is particularly unpleasant,
and we're receiving a record number of FOTM complaints about it. Excellent.
<p>

<li><b>November 21, 1997</b>.<br>
Images from the 1991 flood at Ormoc, Philippines.
<p>

<li><b>November 18, 1997</b>.<br>
A second fuck for the month of November.
<p>

<li><b>November 13, 1997</b>.<br>
Senator Dan Coats has introduced 
<a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,16328,00.html">CDA II</a> in
congress. As you know CDA I was declared unconstitutional on
multiple grounds. <b>Adult site operators:</b> Instead of sending your 
"under 18" traffic to Yahoo or Disney, send them here 
until CDA II is withdrawn.
<p>

<li><b>November 11, 1997</b>.<br>
Images for armistice day: five very graphic WWI wounds.
<p>

<li><b>November 6, 1997</b>.<br>
Five million visitors this year.
<p>

<li><b>November 4, 1997</b>.<br>
New fuck of the month. Unfortunately only one of our providers allows
us to post pornography, and it's been rather irregular lately. We're looking
at other provider options right now.
<p>

<li><b>November 1, 1997</b>.<br>
One of our servers was experiencing intermittent trouble on Halloween,
and was down much of the day. Unfortunately it's the one that had the 
"Halloween Smut", so probably not many people saw the contest in time. 
The pictures were supposed to go down on the 1st, but they will 
stay up until monday because of the trouble.
<p>

<li><b>October 31, 1997</b>.<br>
Some Halloween Smut [defunct link] for your personal enjoyment. Also 
we'll award $50 to the best viewer submission in this category.
<p>

<li><b>October 28, 1997</b>.<br>
Pointer to an image from the recent 
<a href="http://www.asia1.com.sg/zaobao/special/pages/wparm2610.html">
incident</a> in Taiwan in which a rope snapped in a tug-of-war consisting 
of over 1,000 people. Two people's arms were torn off and 45 people
were injured. Pretty.
<p>

<li><b>October 26, 1997</b>.<br>
The <a href="http://vatican.rotten.com/famous/">Famous</a>
gallery has returned. If you've never seen it, go look. (To those
who have seen it and were wondering, the section that used to be at 
the bottom of it will return in expanded form in about a week.)
<p>

<li><b>October 23, 1997</b>.<br>
New feature, a sequence from a Nepalese cremation.
<p>

<li><b>October 19, 1997</b>.<br>
New regular column, "From the Rotten Archives". Starting off 
we have a new cartel shooting image from down south. Not all pictures
here will be gruesome, but they will appear regularly and will be
interesting.
<p>

<li><b>October 17, 1997</b>.<br>
Everyone keeps asking for a <a href="../about/staff.html">staff photo</a>.
<p>

<li><b>October 16, 1997</b>.<br>
Second fuck of the month for October (warning: involves graphic muppetry,
may not be suitable for small children.)
<p>

<li><b>October 15, 1997</b>.<br>
Added a New Orleans streetfight victim to Viewer Submissions. Also,
there is a nifty new <!--a href="http://www.rotten.com/submit/"-->submissions</a> 
page where you can upload images anonymously.
<p>

<li><b>October 12, 1997</b>.<br>
New feature, eight Brazilian aircrash photos.
<p>

<li><b>October 10, 1997</b>.<br>
A new <a href="../about/url.html">submit url</a> feature, use
this page if you want to notify us of some interesting, unusual, or
disturbing site of picture on the WWW.
<p>

<li><b>October 7, 1997</b>.<br>
Added a really disgusting picture of someone's ass (jeep disease)
to the Viewer Submissions.
<p>

<li><b>October 5, 1997</b>.<br>
New fuck of the month, a couple days late.
<p>

<li><b>October 3, 1997</b>.<br>
We've now seen 4 million visitors, one million of which have
come here in the last month.
<p>

<li><b>September 29, 1997</b>.<br>
The site has come back up at about half of the needed
content. One of our major providers booted us after the
Diana stunt. Some alternatives have been arranged but
not enough yet.
<p>

<li><b>September, 1997</b>.<br>
Over 100,000 people try to visit as word spreads in the international media.
About 75,000 of these get through.
<p>

<li><b>End of September, 1997</b>.<br>
Lots of press coverage from everywhere. Details
<a href="../about/press.html">here</a>.
<p>

<li><b>September 19 1997</b>.<br>

<a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/news/breaking/docs/040802.htm">
San Jose Mercury News</a>.
<br>

<p>
We are receiving a much heavier than normal amount of traffic,
nearly 70,000 visitors today (normally 25,000).
<p>

<center>
<font color=red>please note that sometimes links here get
stale as images are moved from server to server, so the links
below have been textified</font>
</center>
<p>

<li><b>September 10, 1997</b>.<br>
The first viewer submission (new column) has arrived.
<p>

<li><b>September 9, 1997</b>.<br>
In celebration of our 3,000,000th visitor, a format change.
Also new content, Murder by Barrel, columns Fuck of the Month Club
and the completely ridiculous Sporting News.
<p>

<li><b>September 8, 1997</b>.<br>
Rotten has seen 3 million visitors this year.
<p>

<li><b>September 2, 1997</b>.<br>
Text of the Jon Benet Ramsey ransom note has been 
obtained and placed online.
<p>

<li><b>August 30, 1997</b>.<br>
A tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales, who died on Saturday.
<p>

<li><b>June 16, 1997</b>.<br>
We have been able to get 13 galleries open at night (two fewer
during the daytime). It has been a great struggle to find homes for
them; they are split among 4 or 5 ISP's. 
<p>

<li><b>May 20, 1997</b>.<br>
There are seven galleries open 24 hours (hopefully.) If you run
an ISP that has at least a T3 and would like to sponsor a gallery,
or will allow us to run 3 or 4 galleries at a reasonable flat rate,
please read our plan and let us know.
<p>

<li><b>May 17, 1997</b>.<br>
One millionth visitor.
<p>

<li><b>May 15, 1997</b>.<br>
The system is now split at three providers, and the traffic is
a bit lower, so I've opened more galleries. If I can line up a couple
more providers, the load becomes quite reasonable on everybody,
and I can add new content on a regular basis again. 
<p>

<li><b>May 12, 1997</b>.<br>
I've got two or three galleries open all the time, thanks to a friend
who has provided some temporary bandwidth. If you own bandwidth and can 
provide space for a gallery, please contact me. This seems to be a
better approach than a ticket system.
<p>
AOL users are confused because their proxy server keeps an old cache
and it appears to them that things are closed when they are open, and vice 
versa.  If you use AOL, I recommend ditching them and finding a real 
internet ISP. 
<p>

<li><b>May 6, 1997</b>.<br>
For the time being two galleries will be open at night (including
last night), I'll try to change which ones every couple of days. 
<p>

<li><b>May 2, 1997</b>.<br>
Traffic is still around 50,000 visitors per day, far too high to
open the traffic to full access. Images have been up at night (except 
I missed one day.) To those who are complaining about us not upgrading
to accommodate the traffic, please note that the next level of service, 
T3, is on the order of $10,000/mo. That's money I don't have.
<p>

<li><b>April 30, 1997</b>.<br>
Yesterday saw 70,000 visitors, far more than we can handle if galleries
were present. I put some images up overnight, and took them down when
traffic became too great as the East Coast woke up. 
<p>

<li><b>April 28, 1997</b>.<br>
Today on national radio, Howard Stern praised rotten.com a number
of times. That's very nice and we appreciate the attention, especially
from a demigod like Mr. Stern. However, it caused the number of
people who visit daily to increase from its already very high 4,500 to
at least 50,000, and perhaps 100,000. The number of hits reached
350,000 before I shut it off for a few hours. It was jamming our normally
zippy T1.
<p>
We aren't equipped to handle this load of traffic. This is a free site,
already quite popular, so the galleries are off until the attention
dies down. Hopefully, this should only be a day or two. As traffic
decreases, we will reopen some or all of the galleries over time.
<p>

<li><b>April 27, 1997</b>.<br>
Added much too married Larry King's arrest mugshot, hoodlum 
Al Pacino's mugshot, public masturbator Pee Wee Herman's mugshot, 
and the really tall mugshot of nosebreaker Charles Barkley.
More will follow in the future.
<p>

<li><b>April 26, 1997</b>.<br>
Good god, traffic is averaging 2.5GB/day, around 190,000 hits. Eeep!
<p>

<li><b>April 20, 1997</b>.<br>
The hard disk was lost, so I reverted to the April 5 snapshot. Though
some new images were added in the last fifteen days, I still have them
elsewhere and they will return.
<p>

<li><b>April 5, 1997</b>.<br>
David Duchovny's personal x file. We cannot begin to understand him.
<p>

<li><b>March 21, 1997</b>.<br>
In case you were wondering about the lack of new items placed on
this site, I've been waiting for our traffic to stabilize. Yesterday
we received 83,000 hits totalling 1181MB transferred. This number 
is very, very large. And much higher than the number three weeks ago.
<p>

<li><b>March 8, 1997</b>.<br>
A woman who seems to enjoy cigarette smoking.
<p>

<li><b>March 6, 1997</b>.<br>
Wonderful photo of Queen Elizabeth II commencing an important 
nasal probe. Is it not wonderful that we have photography to remember 
these magic little moments.
<p>

<li><b>February 17, 1997</b>.<br>
By popular demand images have been added to the sex gallery.
We have a latex nun, a naughty baby carriage, an artist's depiction 
of a dickface, the burdens of having a large penis, and finally, 
a woman's unique tribute to actor Kirk Douglas. [offline]
<p>

<li><b>February 14, 1997</b>.<br>
Three particularly unpleasant racist photos, a lynching, two 
lynch victims surrounded by whitefolk, and a KKK cross lighting. 
Happy valentine's day, everyone!
<p>
Also, today I wrote a nifty preprocessor for creating HTML in the
rotten galleries. At long last, all the galleries have controls,
nongrey backgrounds, and consistency. This makes it ten times
easier to add images to sequence, etc etc etc.
<p>
A photo of Lady Princess Diana Spencer in all her splendor.
<p>

<li><b>February 13, 1997</b>.<br>
Excellent portrait of His Holiness Francis Albert Sinatra, by Rob Day.
<p>

<li><b>February 8, 1997</b>.<br>
The salute from the cover of the April 1974 MAD Magazine.
<p>

<li><b>February 5, 1997</b>.<br>
Not one, not two, but <b>three</b> new galleries, for a 
total of 46 new images. Check out Monstris, which contains 17th 
century engravings of human monsters; Mugshot, mugshots and middle 
finger salutes; and Things, a collection of, well, strange things. 
The top level menu has been split into disturbing and 
non-disturbing areas of interest.
<p>

<li><b>February 3, 1997</b>.<br>
Three additional Hitler images have been located, his birthday
cake, a shot of the US Army destroying his pants, and most spectacularly,
a photo of the Fuhrer atop a rude missile.
<p>

<li><b>February 1, 1997</b>.<br>
In one month we have grown from 2,000 hits/day to 17,000.
<p>

<li><b>January 31, 1997</b>.<br>
The infamous bung sticker, finally adding something to the 
difficult naive gallery. Rumour has it that a new gallery will open soon.
<p>

<li><b>January 27, 1997</b>.<br>
Two shots of Adolf Hitler, in leiderhosen and his dead body.
<p>

<li><b>January 23, 1997</b>.<br>
Another famous actor shot, Dennis Hopper selling out in Japan. And 
something confusing involving a sex chariot.
<p>

<li><b>January 21, 1997</b>.<br>
Bizarre publicity shot of Frank Sinatra surrounded by merry elves.
<p>

<li><b>January 20, 1997</b>.<br>
There are statistics regarding our usage. This will not be updated 
every day until the end of the month. A spike occurred today (10,000 hits) 
because this is the first time rotten was listed in 
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com" target="_main">yahoo</a>.
<p>

<li><b>January 9, 1997</b>.<br>
OJ's Holiday Ham, a must-see. Thanks, Tapio!
<p>

<li><b>January 6, 1997</b>.<br>
Many new astonishing photos in the famous
gallery, including US Presidents, British royalty, etc. We are always on
the lookout for material of this quality, and never finding it.
<p>

<li><b>January 5, 1997</b>.<br>
Two new exhibits in the sex gallery, one of which we title 
<i>The Pylon</i>. [offline] Also, a text article on elephantiasis, from a
19th century source. 
<p>

<li><b>January 4, 1997</b>.<br>
<a href="../today/">This day in rotten history</a>.
<p>

<li><b>January 3, 1997</b>.<br>
A counter on the main page to indicate number of visitors.
<p>

<li><b>January 2, 1997</b>.<br>
Added three new images to the racist gallery: US WWII images and 
propaganda from the pleasant American Eugenics Party. Also, four new 
images in the testicle gallery.
<p>

<li><b>January 1, 1997</b>.<br>
Determined the true story behind the green bean, now known to 
be hailing from New Zealand. The picture is legitimate; have updated 
the description accordingly.
<p>

<li><b>December 31, 1996</b>.<br>
Graphic at the top of the splash screen, a body being broken
on the wheel (late 16th century.)
<p>

<li><b>December 30, 1996</b>.<br>
Abigail Folger's autopsy photo. Folger, the coffee heiress, was killed by 
Charles Manson's followers in 1969. Still need Tate's photo.
<p>

<li><b>December 27, 1996</b>.<br>
New famous gallery, containing
eleven images of the famous and infamous. Many things will eventually
live here. To make room, moved the one green bean image from tiny phallic 
gallery to naive, even though it isn't naive.
<p>

<li><b>December 26, 1996</b>.<br>
Put all the directories under /gallery/, for future restructuring
of the site. Luckily it is still early enough to do this. Also, I am
slowly adding left & right navigation to the galleries.
<p>

<li><b>December 20, 1996</b>.<br>
<a href="http://www.rotten.com/">Rotten dot com</a> goes live. Right now 
there is no splash screen, so the galleries appear on the main page. Some areas 
are still under development, need to scan in more pictures, etc.
<p>

<li><b>July 23, 1996</b>.</br>
Registered rotten.com domain. Surprised it wasn't taken.
