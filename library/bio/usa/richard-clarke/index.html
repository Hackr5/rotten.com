Richard Clarke was a careerist; he had held high-level posts in the administrations of three Presidents -- <a href="/library/bio/presidents/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a>, <a href="/library/bio/presidents/george-hw-bush/">Bush</a> (41), and <a href="/library/bio/presidents/bill-clinton/">Clinton</a> -- before <a href="/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">George W Bush</a> came to Washington. And for whatever reason, Dubya chose to keep Clarke on as Terrorism Czar.
<p>

In mid-August of 2002, following a scathing piece in <i>TIME</i> magazine about the Bush administration's pathetic antiterrorism record prior to 9-11, the White House instructed adviser Richard Clarke to rebut the allegations in an off-the-record background briefing for a handful of favorite journalists. Which he did.
<p>

Clarke assured the reporters that the Bush administration had paid close attention to antiterrorism efforts during the eight months leading up to 9-11. He basically told them:
<p>

<ul>

<li>There was no detailed antiterrorism plan that the Clinton administration furnished to their successors. And what initiatives did exist only aimed to roll back Al Qaeda over the next five years.
<p>

<li>The incoming Bush administration was briefed on the standing policies as well as a series of unresolved issues which had languished for the past couple of years. Consequently, in late January 2001 the Bush administration decided:
<p>

<ol>

<li>Vigorously pursue the Clinton policy, including the lethal covert action efforts.
<p>

<li>Begin looking at those unresolved policy issues and start making some decisions.

</ol>
<p>

<li>They began that process in the spring, during which time they decided to build on the existing Clinton strategy and to increase the CIA's covert action funding five-fold to go after Al Qaeda.
<p>

<li>In late March/early April, various cabinet deputies arrived and began working out the implementation details, and reporting their progress to the relevant senior officials. This process continued all summer. 
<p>

<li>Finally, the senior officials held a meeting at the end of the summer, during which they approved the new antiterrorism strategy, aiming for the rapid elimination of Al Qaeda. They authorized the five-fold increase in CIA funding for combatting Al Qaeda. The strategy also involved policy changes on Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and assisting the Northern Alliance.

</ul>

<h2>The Disputed September 12th Meeting</h2>

In his book <i>Against All Enemies</i>, Clarke recounts an impromptu meeting with the President the next night after the Pentagon/World Trade Center attacks:
<p>

<blockquote><font size=-1><tt>
"Later, on the evening of the 12th, I left the Video Conferencing Center and there, wandering alone around the Situation Room, was the President. He looked like he wanted something to do. He grabbed a few of us and closed the door to the conference room.
<p>

"Look," he told us, "I know you have a lot to do and all ...but I want you, as soon as you can, to go back over everything, everything. See if Saddam did this. See if he's linked in any way."
<p>

I was once again taken aback, incredulous, and it showed. "But, Mr. President, al Qaeda did this."
<p>

"I know, I know, but ... see if Saddam was involved. Just look. I want to know any shred."
<p>

"Absolutely, we will look ...again." I was trying to be more respectful, more responsive. "But, you know, we have looked several times for state sponsorship of al Qaeda and not found any real linkages to Iraq. Iran plays a little, as does Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, Yemen."
<p>

"Look into Iraq, Saddam," the President said testily and left us. Lisa Gordon-Hagerty (from the Office of Emergency Response) stared after him with her mouth hanging open.
</tt></font></blockquote>
<p>

The implication of Clarke's story is that President Bush was hoping to pin some of the responsibility on Saddam to help justify invading Iraq. Eager to dispute this account, Deputy National Security Adviser Stephen A. Hadley essentially called Richard Clarke a liar on the March 21, 2004 episode of <i>60 Minutes</i>.

</blockquote>
<p>

Despite <i>60 Minutes</i>' alleged witness, the White House stuck to their guns. Press secretary Scott McClellan repeated the charge the very next day, telling the press corps: "There's no record of the President being in the Situation Room on that day that it was alleged to have happened, on the day of September the 12th. When the President is in the Situation Room, we keep track of that... He doesn't have any recollection of it, and, again, it purportedly took place in the Situation Room. There's no record to indicate that happened."
<p>

Later that same week, the White House finally conceded that Clarke probably <i>had</i> in fact met with Bush on September 12th, just as he said. So much for those infalliblity of that Situation Room sign-in sheet.
