<h1>William Bennett</h1>

<img src="/library/bio/usa/william-bennett/william-bennett.jpg" height="300" width="247" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

Authored <i>The Death of Outrage: <a href="/library/bio/presidents/bill-clinton/">Bill Clinton</a> and the Assault on American Ideals</i>, about the <a href="/library/history/political-scandal/lewinsky-affair/">Monica Lewinsky</a> scandal, as well as the ironically titled <i>Book of Virtues</i>.
<p>

Former drug czar, Education Secretary, and self-appointed moralist. You can see him occasionally on cable networks doing the pundit thing.
<p>

Regarding his video poker addiction:
<p>

<blockquote><font size=-1>
"I've made a lot of money and I've won a lot of money... Over 10 years, I'd say I've come out pretty close to even... You may cycle several hundred thousand dollars in an evening and net out only a few thousand."
</font></blockquote>
<p>

Since gambling in sight of others would tarnish Bennett's moral image, the casinos ushered him into private $500-a-pull high stakes rooms. Lost $1.4M in the span of a mere two months, and a cool half mil at the <i>Bellagio</i> in <a href="/library/travel/cities/las-vegas/">Las Vegas</a> two days in April 2003. Despite his claims to the contrary about "breaking even", Bennett lost. He lost all the time. Morally, the <i>Man of Virtue</i> justifies this inveterate gambling by saying he "doesn't put his family at risk."

While hosting his radio program <i>Morning in America</i>, Bennett's caller mentions the supposition that the lost revenue from <a href="/library/death/abortion/">aborted</a> pregnancies in the last 30 years could cover the present cost of Social Security:

All right, well, I mean, I just don't know. I would not argue for the pro-life position based on this, because you don't know. I mean, it cuts both - you know, one of the arguments in this book <i>Freakonomics</i> that they make is that the declining crime rate, you know, they deal with this hypothesis, that one of the reasons crime is down is that abortion is up. Well -

Well, I don't think it is either, I don't think it is either, because first of all, there is just too much that you don't know. <i>But I do know that it's true that if you wanted to reduce crime, you could - if that were your sole purpose, you could abort every black baby in this country, and your crime rate would go down.</i> That would be an <i>impossible, ridiculous, and morally reprehensible</i> thing to do, but your crime rate would go down. So these far-out, these far-reaching, extensive extrapolations are, I think, tricky.
