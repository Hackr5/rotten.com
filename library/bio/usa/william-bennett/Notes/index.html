<p>	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3"><b>Bill Bennett 
	and Racism: Who Really Has the Problem?</b></font></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><i>Bill Bennett a 
	racist, or some embarrassed over a community problem?</i></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"> </p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<span style="text-transform: uppercase"><font face="Verdana" size="1">
	<strong>By Bob Ellis</strong></font></span></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<strong><span style="text-transform: uppercase">
	<font face="Verdana" size="1">Editor</font></span></strong></p>
	<p align="justify">The Left has developed a wide-ranging policy of 
	demonizing arguments they find impossible to dispute: if you can’t combat 
	the logic of a statement, then mischaracterize it as saying something 
	reprehensible that the speaker never intended. This has also been quite 
	effective in cowing people who might otherwise support the argument into 
	denouncing it themselves. After all, no one wants to be seen as “outside the 
	mainstream,” or “not traveling with the herd.” And I realize that I risk 
	ostracism and mischaracterization by doing this piece, but then that’s 
	never really been a concern for me. </p>
	<p align="justify">The politically correct gnashing of teeth over Bill 
	Bennett’s recent statement about black babies and abortion is the latest 
	example of this. For those who may not be familiar with the controversy, 
	Bennett (former Secretary of Education, author and talk show host) said on 
	his Sept. 28 radio show “Bill Bennett’s Morning in America” that "You could 
	abort every black baby in this country, and your crime rate would go down.”
	</p>
	<p align="justify">The Left is predictably running ahead mindlessly 
	condemning Bennett’s statement with no regard for the context or intent of 
	the statement. In our racially charged, politically correct society, to say 
	anything negative about a minority—regardless of its truth or accuracy—is 
	simply unacceptable. It’s worse that cussin’ in church used to be. In fact, 
	Congressman John Conyers (D-MI) is hassling Bennett’s radio network, Salem 
	Radio Network, and their sponsors to drop the program </p>
	<p align="justify">As with all things, context is critical. Below is a 
	transcript of the exchange, courtesy of Cybercast News Service (emphasis 
	mine): </p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">CALLER: I noticed the national media, you know, they talk 
	a lot about the loss of revenue, or the inability of the government to fund 
	Social Security, and I was curious, and I've read articles in recent months 
	here, that the abortions that have happened since Roe v. Wade, the lost 
	revenue from the people who have been aborted in the last 30-something 
	years, could fund Social Security as we know it today. And the media just 
	doesn't - never touches this at all. </p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">BENNETT: Assuming they're all productive citizens? </p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">CALLER: Assuming that they are. Even if only a portion of 
	them were, it would be an enormous amount of revenue. </p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">BENNETT: Maybe, maybe, but we don't know what the costs 
	would be, too. I think as - abortion disproportionately occur among single 
	women? No. </p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">CALLER: I don't know the exact statistics, but quite a 
	bit are, yeah. </p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">BENNETT: All right, well, I mean, I just don't know. I 
	would not argue for the pro-life position based on this, because you don't 
	know. I mean, it cuts both - you know, one of the arguments <b>in this book Freakonomics
	</b>that they make is that the declining crime rate, you know, they 
	deal with this hypothesis, that <b>one of the reasons crime is down is that 
	abortion is up.</b> Well - </p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">CALLER: Well, I don't think that statistic is accurate.
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">BENNETT: Well, I don't think it is either, I don't think 
	it is either, because first of all, there is just too much that you don't 
	know. But I do know that it's true that if you wanted to reduce crime, you 
	could - if that were your sole purpose, you could abort every black baby in 
	this country, and your crime rate would go down. <b>That would be an 
	impossible, ridiculous, and morally reprehensible thing to do</b>, but your 
	crime rate would go down. So these far-out, these far-reaching, extensive 
	extrapolations are, I think, tricky. </p>
	<p align="justify">On its surface, it’s hard to figure out why the Left is 
	so upset by this. After all, the Left so idolizes abortion that one would 
	think that everybody, regardless of skin color, should be killing their 
	babies. Let’s all do the macarena! Let’s do the timewarp again! Let’s go 
	crazy; let’s get nuts! Let’s all abort our babies! </p>
	<p align="justify">But perhaps the problem they have with it is the 
	implication that only BLACK babies should be aborted! We’re talking genocide 
	here! White Bennett is trying to wipe out all those unpleasant black people!
	</p>
	<p align="justify">The statement is more egregious yet to the Left because 
	of the inference that the crime rate would go down if more black babies were 
	aborted. Never mind that Bennett disavowed such a practice himself in his 
	next sentence, the idea that black people could be committing more crimes 
	that white people is unacceptable! But as “unacceptable” as it might be, 
	could it be true? </p>
	<p align="justify">An examination of Department of Justice statistics sheds 
	some interesting light on what Bennett said: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">The 2000 U.S. Census indicates 12.69% of the U.S. 
	population is black; 2004 estimates show little change at 12.77% </p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">FBI 2002 crime statistics indicate black people 
	committed 38.0% of all violent crime in the United States. This means a 
	group comprising 13% of the US population committed 38% of all violent 
	crime. </p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">FBI 2002 crime statistics show that black people 
	committed 29.6% of property crimes in the United States. This means a group 
	comprising 13% of the US population committed 30% of all crimes against 
	property. </p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">FBI 2002 crime statistics show that black people 
	committed 50.0% of murders in the US. This means a group comprising 13% of 
	the US population committed 50% of all murders. </p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">FBI 2002 crime statistics show that black people 
	committed 34.0% of forcible rapes in the US. This means a group comprising 
	13% of the US population committed 34% of all forcible rapes. </p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">FBI 2002 crime statistics show that black people 
	committed 54.1% of all robberies in the US. This means a group comprising 
	13% of the US population committed 54% of all robberies. </p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">In what should be a stunning statistic, FBI 2002 crime 
	statistics show that black people committed 21.8% of hate crimes. This means 
	a group comprising 13% of the US population committed 22% of all hate 
	crimes. But I thought hate crimes were only white crimes against blacks—how 
	can this be???  </p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify">I know liberals aren’t used to dealing with facts and 
	logic, so if any <i>can</i> read and <i>are</i> reading this, I’ll spell it out. If Group 
	X made up 13% of the US population and Group X committed 13% of the crimes 
	in the US, then Bennett would have been unfair and factually incorrect in 
	stating that aborting the babies of Group X would reduce crime. However, if 
	Group X made up 13% of the US population, but committed 30% of the crimes in 
	the US, then he would be factually correct in stating that aborting the 
	babies of Group X would reduce crime. </p>
	<p align="justify">Another way of putting it would be that if one group made 
	up 13% of the total population, and that group was no more or less likely to 
	commit a crime than another, then that group would account for 13% of the 
	crimes committed in America. It’s a simple mathematical fact—but I know, 
	facts are anathema to liberals, and very hard for them to deal with. Yet 
	their dislike for the facts, nor the fact that these mathematical facts 
	reflect shame upon ALL Americans, changes the existence of those facts. </p>
	<p align="justify">It would be no less accurate to say that aborting every 
	male child would reduce crime, because most crimes are committed by males. 
	But that would be okay to say…as long as we were talking about white males.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">I am, of course, also forgetting the tired old racist 
	explanation continually carted out by liberals that black people are found 
	guilty of crimes more often because of racist bias against them, a legal 
	system that’s out to get them, and of course the fact that white domination 
	makes blacks so angry and disadvantaged that they must commit crimes. </p>
	<p align="justify">Okay, go ahead and try to come up with any explanation 
	other than dealing with the truth: that a sense of feeling sorry for 
	yourself and wanting payback has let to a moral breakdown with the black 
	segment of our population--encouraged by Race Pimps like Je$$ie Jack$on. Before you vilify me, you might recall that 
	successful and wealthy (black) actor and comedian Bill Cosby has been saying 
	much the same thing recently. </p>
	<p align="justify">Beginning with his speech at the NAACP gala last year, 
	Cosby has been placing the responsibility for the problems of the black 
	community on the black community itself. (Notice I didn’t say “African 
	American;” as Bill Cosby said, “We are not Africans. Those people are not 
	Africans; they don’t know a damned thing about Africa.”) </p>
	<p align="justify">Without for a second excusing slavery or the genuine 
	institutional discrimination blacks have been subjected to in ages past, the 
	following comments which Cosby made at the NAACP gathering speak to the 
	problem of crime in the black community: </p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">“Looking at the incarcerated, these are not political 
	criminals. These are people going around stealing Coca Cola. People getting 
	shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake! Then we all run out 
	and are outraged: ‘The cops shouldn’t have shot him.’ What the hell was he 
	doing with the pound cake in his hand? I wanted a piece of pound cake just 
	as bad as anybody else.” </p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">“It’s not what they’re doing to us. It’s what we’re not 
	doing. 50 percent drop out. Look, we’re raising our own ingrown immigrants. 
	These people are fighting hard to be ignorant. There’s no English being 
	spoken, and they’re walking and they’re angry. Oh God, they’re angry and 
	they have pistols and they shoot and they do stupid things. And after they 
	kill somebody, they don’t have a plan. Just murder somebody. Boom. Over 
	what? A pizza? And then run to the poor cousin’s house.” </p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">“You got to tell me that if there was parenting -- help 
	me -- if there was parenting, he wouldn’t have picked up the Coca Cola 
	bottle and walked out with it to get shot in the back of the head. He 
	wouldn’t have. Not if he loved his parents. And not if they were parenting! 
	Not if the father would come home. Not if the boy hadn’t dropped the sperm 
	cell inside of the girl and the girl had said, ‘No, you have to come back 
	here and be the father of this child.’ Not ..’I don’t have to.’” </p>
	<p align="justify">Again, Bennett never argued in favor of aborting black 
	babies to reduce crime—he stated in the strongest possible terms that such a 
	practice is morally reprehensible. We need to deal with facts, not 
	hysterics. </p>
	<p align="justify">So let’s quit the race-baiting and the politically 
	correct attempts to avoid rhetorical defeat, and address the real issues. We 
	can do that, or we can continue the decades of decay that hurts all 
	Americans, black and white. </p>
	<p align="justify">We’re all God’s children, regardless of the color of our 
	skin. God calls His children to love one another, and He also calls them to 
	take responsibility for their own actions and own up when they’ve done 
	wrong. Our whole country would be much better off if everyone lived that 
	way.</p>
