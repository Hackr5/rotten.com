<h1>Marion Barry</h1>

<img src="/library/bio/usa/marion-barry/200892.4.jpg" height="425" width="259" align=right hspace=10> Marion Barry is easily one of the most colorful public officals in United States history. After serving as mayor of <a href="/library/travel/cities/washington-dc/">Washington, DC</a> for 12 years, he was arrested for smoking crack in a hotel room in 1990 (caught on hidden camera no less) and forced to step down. After serving six months in a federal prison, he was inexplicibly re-elected in 1994. Perhaps Mayor Barry's legacy can best be described in his own words:<p>

<table width=75%>
<tr><td>

<ul>
<li>
"If you take out the killings, Washington actually has a very very low crime rate."

<li>"First, it was not a strip bar, it was an erotic club. And second, what can I say? I'm a night owl."

<li>"The brave men who died in <a href="/library/history/war/vietnam/">Vietnam</a>, more than 100% of which were black, were the ultimate sacrifice."

<li>"I am a great mayor; I am an upstanding Christian man; I am an intelligent man; I am a deeply educated man; I am a humble man."
