<h1>Henry Kissinger</h1>

<img src="/library/bio/usa/henry-kissinger/kissinger-nose.jpg" height="384" width="334" align=left hspace=15 vspace=5>

Secretary of State during the <a href="/library/history/war/vietnam/">Vietnam War</a> under <a href="/library/bio/presidents/richard-m-nixon/">Richard M. Nixon</a>. Who else but Kissinger could win a <i>Nobel Peace Prize</i> for the secret (and illegal) bombing of Cambodia?
<p>

Helped <a href="/library/bio/dictators/agosto-pinochet/">Augusto Pinochet</a> orchestrate the overthrow of <a href="/library/history/countries/chile/">Chile</a>'s democratically elected President Allende. He <i>personally</i> assured Pinochet that his human rights violations were not a problem for the United States. He did this <i>knowing</i> that Pinochet had set up an international network to <a href="/library/history/assassination/">assassinate</a> his enemies.
<p>

Cyprus, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Middle East, Angola, China, and the SALT negotiations. <a href="/library/bio/usa/alexander-haig/">Alexander Haig</a>.
<p>

After Nixon was brought down by <a href="/library/history/political-scandal/watergate/">Watergate</a>, Kissinger remained as Secretary of State under <a href="/library/bio/presidents/gerald-ford/">Gerald Ford</a>.
<p>

<a href="/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">George W Bush</a> tried to post Kissinger as the lead for the <a href="/library/history/wtc/">World Trade Center</a> investigation. The appointment did not even last a week before it became necessary for him to step down because of conflicts of interest. Kissinger is now useless as a statesman or envoy for even the most benign tasks of State, thanks to his now all-too-apparent monied interests.

The President will be back on Monday at 2:00 PM Jakarta time. We understand your problem and the need to move quickly, but I am only saying that it would be better if it were done after we returned.</td>
