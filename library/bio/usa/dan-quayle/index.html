<td valign=top><font size=-1>During a speech at the Democratic National Convention, <a href="/library/bio/religion/jesse-jackson/">Jesse Jackson</a> compares the Vice President to King Herod: "When Mary said Joseph was not the father, she was abused and questioned. If she had <a href="/library/death/abortion/">aborted</a> the baby, she would have been called immoral. If she had the baby, she would have been called unfit, without family values. But Mary had family values. It was Herod -- the Quayle of his day -- who put no value on the family."</font></td>
