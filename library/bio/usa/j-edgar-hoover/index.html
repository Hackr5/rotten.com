<h1>J. Edgar Hoover</h1>

<img src="/library/bio/usa/j-edgar-hoover/199948.4.jpg" height="265" width="200" align=left hspace=15 vspace=5>

Director of the <a href="/library/conspiracy/fbi/">FBI</a> from 1924 until his death in 1972. The Agency was his private fiefdom; no president had enough balls to remove Hoover from office, not even <a href="/library/bio/presidents/richard-m-nixon/">Nixon</a>. It was an FBI that suspected of nearly everyone something criminal, relentlessly hounding Albert Einstein, <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/music/frank-sinatra/">Frank Sinatra</a>, the Kennedys, <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/marilyn-monroe/">Marilyn Monroe</a>, Charlie Chaplin, etc. about communist ties and other <a href="/library/history/huac/">Unamerican Activities</a>.
<p>

It's impossible to underestimate the influence J. Edgar had on American law enforcement throughout the 20th century. As a supporter of prohibition, Hoover presided over the greatest development of organized crime this country has ever seen. And for decades Hoover denied the existence of the <a href="/library/bio/crime/mafia/">Mafia</a>, permitting it to flourish until the 1970's. This would be bad enough, but it's not his worst legacy. That would be permitting the use of law enforcement as a instrument of revenge and politics, a behavior which reached its apex in the <a href="/library/bio/presidents/richard-m-nixon/">Nixon</a> administration.
<p>

But behind the scenes he was more like J. Edna Hoover, what with all the crossdressing. True enough, this corseted crime fighter was spotted more than once wearing an ill-fitting cocktail dress, lisping and prancing around at private parties hosted by the Mob. His pudgy boyfriend Clyde Tolson wasn't even cute, but he must have seen <i>something</i> in that boy.
<p>

Hoover's life insurance policy named Tolson as his beneficiary (listed relationship: "FBI Associate"). They lived in the same apartment. Tolson's grave is even next to Hoover's.

Sent a bouquet of flowers to Walter Jenkins after his YMCA gay sex escapade.
