<h1>Strom Thurmond</h1>

Senator and former Governor of South Carolina. Ran for President in 1948 as a Dixiecrat. That year, the States Rights Democratic Party issued their nine-point platform; these were points four through six:
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
We stand for the segregation of the races and the racial integrity of each race; the constitutional right to choose one's associates; to accept private employment without governmental interference, and to earn one's living in any lawful way. We oppose the elimination of segregation, the repeal of miscegenation statutes, the control of private employment by Federal bureaucrats called for by the misnamed civil rights program. We favor home-rule, local self-government and a minimum interference with individual rights.
<p>

We oppose and condemn the action of the Democratic Convention in sponsoring a civil rights program calling for the elimination of segregation, social equality by Federal fiat, regulations of private employment practices, voting and local law enforcement.
<p>

We affirm that the effective enforcement of such a program would be utterly destructive to the social, economic and political life of the Southern people, and of other localities in which there may be differences in race, creed or national origin in appreciable numbers.
<p>

</tt></blockquote>
<p>

Psychic Jeane Dixon was godmother to his son.
<p>

Authored the "Southern Manifesto" against school desegregation.
