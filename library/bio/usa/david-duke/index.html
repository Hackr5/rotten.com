<td valign=top><font size=-1><i>The Witchita Sun</i> quotes David Duke as saying: "White people don't need a law against rape, but if you fill this room up with your normal black bucks, you would, because niggers are basically primitive animals." Later, Duke refutes this in a 1997 interview, although only sort of: "Whoever gave you that quote is totally inaccurate... No one is going to find any tape of me using the word nigger or talking in those kinds of terms. Now I certainly will talk frankly and openly about the fact that there is a problem of black rape of white women in this country. The truth is there are two hundred white women raped in America by a black man for every one black woman raped by whites."</font></td></tr>

<td valign=top><font size=-1>In an editorial in the NAAWP newsletter, David Duke asks: "Am I an alarmist? Is my vision unreal? All one has to do is look around this globe and see the Third World reality. Are whites holding every one of the nonwhite countries down, or are we in fact pumping billions of dollars into them along with every technological aid that the West can produce? And now the West itself is gradually being enveloped by nonwhite immigration. The exploding numbers of nonwhites are slowly wrapping formerly white nations in a dark human cocoon. Shall a butterfly emerge, or the beast that has haunted the ruins of every great white civilization that submitted to invasion by immigration and racial miscegenation?"</font></td></tr>
