<h1>Al Goldstein</h1>
<h2>aka Alvin Goldstein</h2>

<img src="/library/bio/pornographers/al-goldstein/goldstein-fuck-you.jpeg" height="244" width="250" align=right hspace=15 vspace=15>

Founder of <i>Screw</i> magazine.
<p>

Try as you might, you will not find a speech, paragraph, or article declaring Al Goldstein a "nice guy". It's just not the way the man is wired. Every description of him makes it quite clear he is foul, profane, brutally cruel to his staff and friends, and constantly floating in what could charitably be called a <I>cloud of noxiousness</i>. But at least he's <i>consistent</i>.
<p>

Once offered $10,000 to anyone who could locate an actual snuff film (snuff created for sexual purposes.) Nobody has ever claimed this reward.
<p>

Got a blowjob from <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/linda-lovelace/">Linda Lovelace</a> during an interview promoting <i>Deep Throat</i>, but got pissed off at her after she quit porn and released an autobiography which included unflattering stories about Goldstein.
<p>

Claims to have been arrested 19 times.
<p>

Curtis Sliwa on Al: "He doesn't have a humanitarian bone in his body."
