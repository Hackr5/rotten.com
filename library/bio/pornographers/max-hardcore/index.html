        Hardcore</h1>
      <p><i>"The easiest way to separate a girl from her clothing is with 
        a camera."</i></p>
      <p>Where and how does one begin a critical analysis of <b>Max Hardcore</b>, 
        performer and pornographer extraordinaire? <br>
        <br>
        The man's been called many things, from sadistic misogynist to vicious 
        child molester; from American original to industry visionary. Even outspoken 
        pro-porn groups wholly supportive of explicit sexual endeavors regularly 
        (but reluctantly) come forward to denounce Max's homespun pseudo-pedophilia 
        as a singularly abnormal and highly toxic cancer upon their private, economy-proof 
        clubhouse.</p>
      <p>People who regard him as little more than a sociopathic, safari-suited 
        child rapist in a cowboy hat aren't being completely fair: from time to 
        time he wears colorful, Italian printed silk shirts and neatly pressed 
        beige slacks. Since 
        1990, he's produced and directed over 1500 sex scenes instrumental in 
        launching the careers of porn stars like Tiffany Minx, Anastasia Blue, 
        Davia Ardell, Lil' Sinderella, Lovette, and many others. This has nothing 
        to do with the size of his penis, which can be classified by anyone's 
        standards as exactly average.</p>
      <p>In 1992, Zane Entertainment hired him to produce <i>The Anal Adventures 
        of Max Hardcore,</i> a series which which paved the way for a controversial 
        career, and not all masturbators were prepared for what they saw. Max 
        engaged in rough-edged, wild-eyed sessions with young, seemingly naive 
        industry newcomers. Hard pounding, dirty talking, anally fixated, impossibly 
        raw sex scenes often included teenie-boppers dressed as young waifs. The 
        primary "backstory" for his scenes involves finding a girl who 
        needs attention, telling her she's pretty enough to be a model, and assuring 
        her she'll make a lot of money and become famous if she appears in a video.</p>
      <p>If <i>Hitchcockian, Lynchian</i> and <i>Spielbergian</i> are suitable 
        brand-jectives suggesting a specific range of easily identifiable cinematic 
        stylings, both the iconography and moniker of "Max Hardcore" 
        communicate similar sentiment among patrons of x-rated fare. For every 
        ten people who believe Max is a walking, talking, jerking, squirting incarnation 
        of everything hideously wrong with adult films, there are ten <i>thousand</i> 
        actively masturbating without apology to his brilliant fusion of colorful 
        imagery, intolerable cruelty, female degradation and aggressive, determined 
        brutality. He reduces the likes of vapid, vacuous <i>Vivid Video</i> girls 
        to the functional equivalent of discardable Chinese take-out menus dangling 
        from your front doorknob. His unique interpretation of what constitutes 
        "barely legal teen action" makes the complete works of <a href="/library/bio/pornographers/larry-flynt/">Larry Flynt</a> look like an <i>Ikea</i> catalog. If pornography is meant to evolve 
        and escape the inevitable onslaught of increasing mainstream acceptance, 
        Max Hardcore belongs at the frontlines of the industry, for all our sakes. 
        Formerly Max Steiner, previously Paul Little -- let's just label him one 
        of the most influential pornographers of all time and move on.</p>
      <p>"I 
        do try to get the most out of my girls with braces and retainers, including 
        piss, puke, and throat fucking. I like silly young sluts with braces. 
        I know how to make them feel good. Most people criticize their looks with 
        braces, but I tell them how cute they are in them. I mean, have you ever 
        seen a 24 year old with braces?"</p>
      <p>Max's female performers address him only as "Mister," and they're 
        really dolled up to the nines. Imbecilic bubblegum-flavored Wet 'n' Wild 
        lipstick smeared haphazardly across taut, shiny faces. High heels, tennis 
        socks, tightly-fitting <b>baby clothes</b> (not to be confused with crop-top 
        "baby tees" intended for adults) in flowery pastel palettes 
        of pink and yellow. Bobble-headed barrettes, scrunchies, ponytails 'n' 
        pigtails, braces, <b>and</b> retainers all adorn the ninety pound itty-bitty-titty 
        wirehanger frames of his intended prey. To say these girls <b>look kinda 
        young</b> is a dangerous understatement. They look about eleven. He finds 
        that lipstick brands marketed to teens stand up to tremendous punishment. 
        "Repeated reamings, piss and puke, and it's still there. Really amazing 
        stuff. I had tried the brush-on high price crap and that's just useless. 
        The eye shadow and cheek makeup I use is the low-cost stuff used by teens. 
        Those are the only ones who have the bright pinks and blues that really 
        pop on camera."<p>
        Indeed, 
        his girls are quickly soaked with vomit and drenched in urine. "If 
        you're going to do peeing," Max said during a panel interview with 
        Tera Patrick, "you have to be well-hydrated." Tears spill from 
        the cartoonish eyes of his female performers, eye makeup smears artfully 
        along protruding, youthful cheekbones, mingling with the unavoidable presence 
        of stringy mucus until their faces look like sloppy, painted-up rodeo 
        clowns. Forced smiles inevitably contort into grimacing, shaky half-sobs 
        as Max instructs them to look in the camera and address their mothers 
        in squeaky <b>I've Been Molestered</b> voices. <i>H-how do you like me 
        n-now, mom? I'm a r-real live m-m-model! Are you proud of me? </i>Max 
        answers one girl by grabbing her throat and yanking her ass off his dick. 
        He hoses her face down with piss, stuffing his dong down her throat so 
        hard she Ipecac-pukes buckets of clumpy beige liquid with spluttery fanfare 
        across his balls and down the front of her Apple Kitty tube-top. She blows 
        bubbles. He hands her a cigarette, slaps her face and tells her to get 
        with the program.<p>
        <img src="camera.jpg" width="160" height="344" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">In 
         one outtake, Max's victim gets an golden arc of stinging urine straight 
        in the eye, where it sticks behind her contact lens. She lurches back, 
wincing 
        in obvious discomfort. As she rises from the cement floor of the truckstop 
        restroom, cameras and lights are set aside.<br>
        <br>
        "It's in my eye," she balks. "I'm wearing contacts."<br>
        <br>
        Max is not amused with this delay. "Is it just foggy? Do you need 
        water? Is it life-threatening?"<br>
        <br>
        "No," she replies, annoyed.</p>
      <p>"Then pull your panties down. And listen, let's get one thing straight. 
        There's only one guy who calls <i>cut</i> on the set, and that's me."<br>
        <br>
        "Try being a little easy, please," she implores.<br>
        <br>
        <i>"I am being easy,"</i> Max barks, letting loose with a angry 
        torrent of urine. He deliberates splashes it up and down her face, pulling 
        her hair back with his free hand. She purses her smeary lips together, 
        angry and humiliated.</p>
      <p>Let's 
        all step into the Wayback machine for just a moment, to the 1980s, during 
        which time the majority of adult features were available on video "tapes". 
        Before Max, not many cassettes boasted anal scenes, let alone "all-anal" 
        extravaganzas. Anal sex filmed during this miserable era were consistently 
        presented in the <b>worst</b> way anyone could ever imagine, with directors 
        instructing performers to convey a sense of dignity, class, and cleanliness 
        to the proceedings. Onscreen, this was chiefly telegraphed to viewers 
        by way of performers slowing down and "wooing" the taboo during 
        overextended, pedantic mood sequences: wordless, soft-focus erotic montages 
        complimented by tasteful candlelight and satin sheets, as if a <b>stupid 
        whore's puckered butthole</b> was the Taj Mahal. Rest assured, Max put 
        a stop to that nonsense <i>toot sweet,</i> leveraging the full power of 
        anal sex as God himself originally intended. In Mr. Hardcore's arena, 
        anal sex became less of a plot point and more of a full-throttle narrative 
        engine designed to humiliate and degrade multiple female performers at 
        once, and <b>as much as humanly possible.</b> Max believed sex was better 
        when accompanied by its own natural sounds rather than being drowned out 
        by swelling music. </p>
      <p>In 
        this post-Max world, even <i>Vivid</i> videos are compelled to feature 
        at least one anal scene. Anything less would be an insult to the home 
        viewer. Today, 
        all-anal videos and DVDs dominate the market, constituting at least half 
        the releases consistently ranked among the best-selling adult films charted 
        by Adult Video News. If Max Hardcore had footage of Private Jessica Lynch 
        getting anally gangbanged by twelve Iraqi soldiers, he wouldn't pull a 
        Flynt and bury it - he'd name it<i> Jessica Lynch's Privates</i>, and 
        make it available on the Apple Music Store for ninety-nine cents.</p>
      <p>In Max Hardcore videos, a girl's rear end is likely to be dilated to 
        an <i>outrageously</i> uncomfortable circumference, usually with a clear 
        plastic gynocological speculum equipped with a temperature gauge and buzzing 
        electric lights. Awkward, biological attributes like the pokey-poke tip 
        of a tiny turd or never-before-seen red, raw tubular tunnels are brilliantly 
        illuminated for all to see -- yes, let's just come right out and say it 
        -- deep within her <b>cavernous sphincter</b>. Sorry if you can't jerk 
        off to that, but more often than not Max's films are less about masturbation 
        and more about showing the audience something they don't exactly see every 
        day. </p>
      <p>There is only one male performer in Max Hardcore videos, and that's Max 
        Hardcore himself. He brings to the table no modest lexicon of terms of 
        endearment for his female victims. He refers to them (somewhat alphabetically) 
        as cock sockets, cum gargles, fuck holes, and jizz guzzlers. During extended 
        sequences, he concatenates enumerated descriptors into a battery of demeaning 
        expletive chains, a-la "piss-soaked, cum-splattered, soil-soaked, 
        puke-stained, slime-covered, ass-blasted, fender-flapping, sponge-stupid 
        shitfucks".</p>
      <p>On 
        <b>Sofia Ferrari:</b> "A total fuck pig that puked on my cock several 
        times and kept on going." <br>
        <br>
        On <b>Kitty Yung: </b>"In the early scenes I could have talked this 
        whore into sucking my dog's dick. But she learned the fateful word 'no' 
        later on." <br>
        <br>
        On <b>J.R. Carrington: </b>"Total fuck slut who would do anything 
        for money." <br>
        <br>
        On <b>Autumn Day:</b> "Anything, and I mean anything was the way 
        I had this slut processed. Not a typical porn girl. Just a total slut." 
        <br>
        <br>
        On <b>Tiffany Mynx: </b>"At the beginning, anything would be possible. 
        But she got to be an uppity fat fuck shortly afterwards." <br>
        <br>
        On <b>China Lee:</b> "Any thing is possible with this whore, including 
        licking donkey balls." <br>
        <br>
        On <b>Channone:</b> "The only problem I had with this whore is she 
        spoke very little English. Nowadays I just would just start pissing down 
        her throat and I'm sure she would take it." <br>
        <br>
        On <b>Alexandra Silk:</b> "She would pretty much do whatever I wanted 
        at the time, including fisting. But then let a little success go to her 
        head and wouldn't speak to me for years."</p>
      <p>On <b>Penelope:</b> "She guzzles piss with the best of them and 
        I even taught her how to fist herself."<br>
        <br>
        Warning signs adorn his southern California studio. There will be no drinking 
        on the set. No drugs. Nobody under age eighteen is allowed anywhere near 
        the property. And yet, there are moments in Max Hardcore vignettes where 
        you absolutely, positively can't believe what he's convinced someone to 
        do while stone cold sober. Does he hate women? He claims not to, citing 
        a wonderful childhood and a loving home.</p>
      <p>Repeated 
        insults and name calling, choke-fucking, and ass-to-mouth stuffing are 
        part and parcel of Max's ongoing legacy. But practices like <i>projectile 
        anal squirting </i>-- his words, not ours -- are not always enough for 
        his diehard fans, who regularly contribute constructive feedback on his 
        private, members-only message boards about what <b>they'd like to see. 
        </b>"Can you do some milkshake enemas?" one user pleads. "Pour 
        it into a whore's asshole, then plunge your cock in and have it spill 
        out down the whore's thighs and cunt (nice and messy), then get another 
        slut to suck and lick the rest of the milkshake out of the slut's asspipe 
        and do some spit swapping between the two fucktoys. Hope these suggestions 
        are of some use."</p>
      <p><i><img src="avatar.gif" width="80" height="80" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Thanks 
        for the suggestions,</i> Max replies. <i>Be looking for them -- <b>in 
        the movies! </b></i></p>
      <p>Pre-Max, videos had about five sex scenes apiece, and rarely deviated 
        from this format. But. Dr. Hardcore, Ph.D. observed that renters would 
        more often than not secure two or three videos a night. That's a <i>complete 
        evening</i> of masturbation, with a little leftover for the next morning 
        before work. He believed he could get away with fewer scenes, providing 
        he showed the customer what he (or she!) wanted to see. His modus operandi? 
        A scant <i>three</i> scenes per tape. Each rented and sold beautifully. 
        Producers followed suit, stretching their existing materials wider than 
        a gaping tailpipe, and increased the number of available titles on the 
        market. Talk about a <b>win-win</b> for the consumer.</p>
      <p>"Seven years ago a scene consisted of seven minutes, a couple of 
        positions and the pop shot. Nowadays, the scenes are longer and people 
        expect more intense work. I'm compared to Rocco Siffredi. Intensity is 
        what the public demands of us."</p>
      <p>Max 
        helped pioneer an ostensibly gonzo style of adult filmmaking. "It's 
        pretty easy to get a slut to spread solo for the camera," he muses. 
        "And quite a different matter to get her to take it up the ass and 
        puke up piss."</p>
      <p>General Motors owns DirectTV, which distributes over <b>forty million 
        streams</b> of porn into American homes every month. AT&T Broadband 
        and Comcast Cable are the currently biggest American companies accommodating 
        consumerbators with <i>The Hot Network,</i> Adult Pay-Per-View and similarly 
        themed services. AT&T and GM rake in approximately <b>80% </b>of all 
        porn dollars spent by consumers -- but you won't read about it in their 
        annual stockholder reports, which contain no mention of adult material, 
        nor how much porn contributes to their bottom lines.</p>
      <p>While these businesses happily authorize the distribution of pornographic 
        content (offering independent producers like Max a protective layer of 
        legitimacy) it was inevitable that child pornography charges would eventually be leveled against him by a Los Angeles District Attorney, 
        specifically with respect to <i>Max Extreme 4: Extreme Team, 
        Volumes #18, #19, #21</i> and yes, <i>#24.</i></p>
      <p>Max's attorney 
        Jeffrey Douglas: "The thing which offended the police so much was 
        the relatively subtle underage sex fantasy. No one is declared to be underage 
        and it is a relatively minor theme, but that just got the LAPD incensed. 
        So that was the thrust of the prosecution's case: a film with the implication 
        that there are underage characters; that's what they want to be determined 
        to be obscene." Similar obscenity charges were filed against Adam Glasser (for 
        <i>Seymour Butts' Tampa Tushy Fest</i>) and Jeff Seward (for <i>American 
        Bukakke #11</i>), but both cases were plea-bargained down to public nuisances.</p>
      <p>Max's case started in 1998 and ended in 2002, with a hung jury and a 
        mistrial. The case went nowhere after the U.S. Supreme Court voided sections 
        of the Child Pornography Prevention Act meant to criminalize adults in 
        sexually explicit conduct with those who appeared to be under the age 
        of eighteen. That left only the Distribution of Obscenity charges, which resulted 
        in a deadlock. </p>
      <p><img src="intro.jpg" width="300" height="400" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Specifically, 
        the Supreme Court ruled that in order for material to be considered child 
        pornography, it <b>has to have children in it. </b>In a 6-3 decision, 
        the high court struck down Sections 2256(8)(B) and 2256(8)(D) of the Child 
        Pornography Prevention Act which previously made it a crime punishable 
        by a minimum of five years in federal prison to include someone who "appears 
        to be" a minor in a sexually-oriented work, or if such work were 
        advertised so as to "convey the impression" that there were 
        minors therein involved in sexual situations.<br>
        <br>
        "We were extremely disappointed with this decision," said Jay 
        Sekulow, Chief Counsel of <a href="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/pat-robertson/">Pat Robertson's</a> American Center for Law and 
        Justice. But Max was elated. "We're going to continue to produce 
        our movies using girls that are young, fresh and excited. It's never my 
        intention to lead a viewer to believe that a girl is underage. What we try 
        to do is to portray a young lady's innocence to the experience of sex 
        for the first time. My experience has been that a lot of the girls we 
        work with enjoy role playing and acting as if it's the first time for 
        them."</p>
      <p>Max Hardcore's name evokes rounds of applause by the porn high-rollers 
        at industry conventions. His fans have rewarded him with a generous income 
        which perches him in a lofty four-story chateau high atop the Pasadena 
        hills, where he continues to crank out controversial, iconoclastic videos 
        meant to stretch the limits of acceptable behavior and obliterate the 
        concept of shame.</p>
