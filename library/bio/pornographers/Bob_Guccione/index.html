Publisher of Penthouse magazine who bankrolled the porn blockbuster <a href="/library/bio/romans/caligula/">Caligula</a>.
<p>

In an effort to lobby the <a href="/library/bio/crime/serial-killers/unabomer/">Unabomber</a>, Guccione bought a full page in in the New York Times. He offered a monthly magazine column which reaches far into the corridors of power: "Penthouse is one of the biggest and most quoted magazines in the history of our industry. For 25 years it was and continues to be the single, biggest selling magazine in the Pentagon. If it's attention you want, you'd be hard-pressed to do better." Guccione went further, saying "I am still your only friend in the media."
