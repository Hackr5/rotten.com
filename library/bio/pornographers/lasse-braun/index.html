<h1>Lasse Braun</h1>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td width="50%"> <p align="justify">Lasse Braun (1936 -- )</p>
      <p align="justify"><br>
        <em>     "I believe pornography is at the 
        center of the biggest cultural revolution of our century."</em></p>
      <p align="justify">     So says <strong>Lasse Braun,</strong> 
        a pornography king arguably higher in stature than <a href="/library/bio/pornographers/hugh-hefner/">Hugh Hefner</a> and <a href="/library/bio/pornographers/bob-guccione/">Bob Guccione</a> combined. The man was the focus of international prosecution, 
        taking legal bullets in stride long before <a href="/library/bio/pornographers/larry-flynt/">Larry Flynt</a> or <em>Hustler</em> 
        magazine. Braun's primary claim to fame was pioneering and refining the 
        <strong>loop:</strong> a silent 8mm or 16mm film reel taped in a circle, 
        suitable for private home projection and endless masturbation.</p>
      <p align="justify">     From 1961 to 1977, his 
        camera captured inventive, artistic, sloppy, disgusting and <em>intense</em> 
        scenes of hardcore sexual gangbangs with quite literally the most beautiful 
        women anyone at the time had ever seen in their lives. Danish girls with 
        shiny, beautiful faces getting fucked good and proper. Lesbians cat fighting, 
        getting filthy dirty in the mud while kissing, drooling, and smooshing 
        bananas. Extended outdoor blowjobs, pop shots like they were going out 
        of style, and <em>so</em> much more.<br>
        <br>
              Braun's creations were lavish, his scenarios 
        uncensored, and his female performers <em>extremely popular.</em> Each 
        reel sold by the millions. Then they were duplicated and distributed for 
        additional millions. In no time at all, eight-to-twelve minute featurettes 
        like <em>Piss & Orgasm, Tit Friction, Anal Libido, Cake Orgy,</em> 
        and <em>Midnight Sodomites</em> were being viewed worldwide in arcades, 
        bookstores, and high-class peepshows. Because they were screened so intensely 
        -- over and over again in front of a blistering white light 
        bulb -- the average copy lasted seven days. The March 12, 
        1975 issue of <em>Variety</em> announced that Braun's <em>French Blue</em> 
        was grossing nearly $75,000 a week. This was more than twice the earnings 
        of <em>The Man With The Golden Gun</em> and <em>Dracula. </em>Yes, the 
        loops of Lasse Braun would be the foundation and building blocks for a 
        worldwide adult industry. He had exactly <strong>one goal:</strong> to 
        popularize pornography on such a massive scale that its legalization would 
        be inevitable. </p>
      <p align="justify">     On his eighth birthday, 
        Braun <a href="/library/sex/virginity/">fucked</a> a nine-year old Italian girl in the attic of his house, with 
        her enthusiastic participation. He was, after all, the son of a diplomat, 
        fluent in various languages, and a specialist in seduction. He had love 
        affairs across all of Europe and throughout law school. His radical doctorate 
        dissertation, <em>Judiciary Censorship in the Western World</em> provoked 
        controversy, and it was promptly censored by the establishment.</p>
      <p align="justify">     Lasse Braun personally 
        conceived, produced, directed, edited and marketed his films, and even 
        developed theories about what kind of <strong>container</strong> his porn 
        would be boxed in. He eschewed the plain brown wrapper, the manilla envelopes, 
        the small blank boxes with hand-written titles and a picture glued on. 
        He invented the <em>good </em>kind<em> </em>of box, the one with <em>cutesy 
        girlies </em>on the outside so you really know what you're getting. His 
        innovative package design distinguished his product from everything ordinary. 
        He set up a graphic design service bureau, the <em>Golden Rose Center</em>, 
        with a Danish art director and four assistants. The workflow he oversaw 
        was tremendous.</p>
      <p align="justify">      Elegantly dressed, Braun 
        would enter retail shops and ask if they carried "sex books" 
        or magazines. When they politely said no, he offered the owners free samples 
        of <strong>his</strong> product, suggesting that they charge a high retail 
        price to reap significant profit. Over time, this earned him the honest-to-gosh 
        nickname of <em>Santa Claus.</em></p>
      <p align="justify">     Braun was tackling this 
        enterprise during a period in history when even brief, fleeting glimpses 
        of <em>partial</em> nudity were considered a major taboo. The Cold Was 
        was in full effect Nations hated each other, and pornography seemed the 
        perfect vehicle to incorporate a multinational police apparatus. In the 
        non-unified European countries like Sweden, Denmark, West Germany, Italy, 
        France and Spain -- printing boxes for porn or getting film 
        developed was extremely dangerous. Everything Braun did during the early 
        sixties and 1970's was a felony, and penalties in <em>every</em> nation 
        (including the United States) were as swift and brutal as one might expect. 
        Contraband had to be entirely concealed from police departments, pirates, 
        and thieves. Even distributors would be singled out as necessary victims 
        of the revolution, and from time to time Braun himself would bring charges 
        against those involved in under-the-table dealings without his implicit 
        participation. Lawyers on either side of these disputes would abstractly 
        refer to the pornography in question as "shipments".</p>
      <p align="justify">      Following John F. Kennedy's 
        proclamation that America would send a man to the moon, Braun proclaimed 
        that before the end of the decade, he would get at least one European 
        country to officially legalize pornography. He used aliases and moved 
        around. He stealthily switched offices and machinery, during which time 
        precious pornography was lost or destroyed. When European authorities 
        began judicial procedures against one of his false identities, Braun knew 
        he was in trouble. They were getting closer; he was forced into further 
        secrecy and disguise, sometimes leaving town in the dead of night. His 
        films were banned, causing ripples of bankruptcy throughout the community.</p>
      <p align="justify">     But Braun refused to shoot 
        conventional, soft-core flicks. He considered half-assed flashy titty 
        shows "a brain-damaging institution created by a bunch of criminals 
        to blind people, to milk gullible masses to the limit" But he spent 
        his earnings wisely. He understood that in order to attract high-spirited 
        sex performers and people of advanced culture into his unprecedented erotic 
        undertakings, he'd have to play the game. He'd have to schmooze with those 
        of expensive habits, deep pockets, fancy cars and drugs. But he never 
        once fell down. He fought the good fight. In June 1977, after fifteen 
        years of challenging sexual repression and achieving incredible success, 
        Lasse Braun retired. The number of judiciary cases piling up against him 
        in Italy were wearying. He'd spent a lifetime obliterating the very concept 
        of shame, but he'd grown to dislike the greedy, superficial attitude of 
        distributors. They flew in the face of his idealized movement to break 
        down censorship into easily disposable components. </p>
      <p align="justify">     In 1980, Braun entrusted 
        an ex-wife in Italy with his original prints, as he prepared to relocate 
        to California. Unfortunately, she discovered one of her live-in girlfriends 
        was a drug dealer. Not wanting any police activity in her home, and fearing 
        the worst, the ex-wife destroyed every last negative, film, photo and 
        loop. What remains of the Braun archive is burned on a handful of DVDs 
        here and there, and people's blissful memories.<br>
        <br>
             As if this illustrious career wasn't sufficient, 
        Lasse Braun in his later years conducted scientific studies on 364 non-orgasmic 
        women (from 21 different countries) between the ages of 18 and 68. He 
        wished to determine if the mythical <em>G-Spot</em> really existed. With 
        the collaboration of two handsome assistants -- one Italian, 
        one American -- he was able to induce female ejaculation and 
        full shuddering orgasm in one hundred percent of his volunteers.</p></td>
