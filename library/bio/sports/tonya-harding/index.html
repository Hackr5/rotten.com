"It's an image that the media has given me as a bad girl, and the only reason they gave me that image is just because of the few things that have gone wrong in my life, and also because I grew up living in a trailer."

Jeff Gillooly's autobiographical account of his 1990 wedding night with wife Tonya Harding. Gillooly captures the chilling chemistry between the couple who plotted to injure Olympic skater Nancy Kerrigan. Much like Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway in <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>, the chillingness of their crimes is juxtaposed with the heat of their sexuality. Gillooly's directorial style is free flowing, letting his co-star improvise. He understands the camera is a voyeur and sets the film in a small claustrophobic room. Most directors might have shown the room dark and awash in shadow to symbolize the dark lives of the two lovers. The genius of Gillooly is that he awashes the room in bright light, letting the couple's creamy white bodies gleam in an almost heavenly glow. This is not the story of their sordid criminal activities, this is the story of their love and their love making. 5'-1" Tonya Harding clothed reminds me of an angry Sally Field, a tiny bulldog, strong, barking, and scary if not chained. But as Tonya strips for the camera, we see she is vulnerable, coy, cute, and fun loving. This is <i>not</i> an empty headed sex kitten, this is a complex woman willing to show us her feelings as well as her body. Gillooly pushes the envelope in his first documentary featurette by showing us full frontal nudity of both Tonya and himself. This bold move is so truthful we really feel for the ill-fated couple. And Tonya Harding is cute. Nude, she looks a bit like Sally Field in her nude scenes in <i>Stay Hungry</i> and perhaps she will have a career someday to match.
