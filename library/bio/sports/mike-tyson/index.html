<h1>Mike Tyson</h1>

<img src="/library/bio/sports/mike-tyson/tyson_fingers_shrunk.jpg" height="205" width="225" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>

Sociopathic heavyweight boxer. You can bet that when Mike Tyson was sent to prison, nobody in there messed with him. Favorite quote: "I'm on the Zoloft to keep me from killing y'all."

Represented by <a href="/library/bio/sports/don-king/">Don King</a> for a while.

Nice tattoo of <a href="/library/bio/misc/che-guevara/">Che Guevara</a> on his lower abdomen.
