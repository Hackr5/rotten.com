<h1>Timothy Leary</h1>

<p><b>Timothy Leary</b> (October 22, 1920 - May 31, 1996)</p>
<p><i>"Six words: drop out, turn on, then come back and tune it in... and 
  then drop out again, and turn on, and tune it back in... it's a rhythm... most 
  of us think God made this universe in nature-subject object-predicate sentences... 
  turn on, tune in, drop out... period, end of paragraph. Turn the page... it's 
  all a rhythm... it's all a beat. You turn on, you find it inside, and then you 
  have to come back (since you can't stay high all the time) and you have to build 
  a better model. But don't get caught - don't get hooked - don't get attracted 
  by the thing you're building, cause... you gotta drop out again. It's a cycle. 
  Turn on, tune in, drop out. Keep it going, keep it going... the nervous system 
  works that way... gotta keep it flowing, keep it flowing..."</i></p>
<p><i><img src="200798.1.jpg" width="351" height="244" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></i>Okay, 
  so it's a little over six words, but it's the debut pop-culture rap delivered 
  by counterculture guru Dr. Timothy Leary, a man who gobbled over 5,000 doses 
  of LSD in his lifetime and inspired President <a href="/library/bio/presidents/richard-m-nixon/">Richard M. Nixon</a> to call him 
  "the most dangerous man in America." Leary was an intelligent, witty, 
  unabashed hedonist who later in life became an Internet enthusiast.</p>
<p>The government was indeed alarmed by how quickly teenagers flocked to Leary 
  in the sixties and seventies. At the time, television and newspapers were filled 
  with sensationalist tales of young people having horrible, deadly drug experiences. 
  Politicians, police officials, and institutional psychiatrists all denounced 
  <a href="/library/crime/drugs/lsd-blotters/">LSD</a> and <a href="/library/crime/drugs/marijuana/">marijuana</a> as the most horrific threats ever confronted by the human 
  race. When Leary sat before <a href="/library/bio/usa/ted-kennedy/">Ted Kennedy</a> at a 1966 Senate hearing on LSD, 
  he expressed disappointment at the media's complete absence of stories involving 
  alcohol abuse, or the deaths resulting from <a href="/library/bio/business/henry-ford/">Henry Ford</a>'s shitty automobiles.</p>
<p><img src="leary_sign.jpg" width="220" height="207" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right">Timothy 
  Leary was a professor at Harvard University when he began experimenting with 
  psilocybin, acid, and other hallucinogens. His test subjects included prominent 
  Bohemian luminaries like Thelonious Monk, Aldous Huxley, <a href="/library/bio/authors/beats/allen-ginsberg/">Allen Ginsberg</a>, 
  <a href="/library/bio/authors/william-s-burroughs/">William S. Burroughs</a>, and <a href="/library/bio/authors/beats/jack-kerouac/">Jack Kerouac</a>. After running low on beatniks, 
  he switched to prison inmates, homeless people, and religious students. Leary 
  argued publicly that hallucinogens could be used to treat personality disorders, 
  but ultimately these beliefs got him booted from Harvard. His lifelong enthusiasm 
  for <i>tripping out</i> would quickly overshadow his acclaim as one of America's 
  most innovative psychologists. The inevitable goals of LSD sessions were (a) 
  to discover and make love with God, (b) to discover and make love with yourself, 
  and (c) to discover and make love with a woman.</p>
<p><img src="/library/bio/mad-science/timothy-leary/Timmarriane.GIF" height="137" width="190" width="190" height="137" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">In 
  1944, while training in Pennsylvania, he met a woman named Marianne. They got 
  married, moved to sunny downtown Berkeley, and had two kids. Leary earned a 
  doctorate in psychology, and was appointed Director of Psychological Research 
  at the Kaiser Foundation. He came to discover that one third of patients who 
  receive traditional psychotherapy get better, one third get worse, and one third 
  stay exactly the same. He wondered if people wouldn't be better off just getting 
  high.</p>
<p> Meanwhile, Marianne had been suffering from post partum depression, and she 
  began to drink heavily. She and Leary fought with regularity. On his 35th birthday, 
  he awoke to find Marianne in a closed garage with the car running. She was dead, 
  the first in a series of family tragedies. Leary would later experience two 
  more divorces, and the suicide of his daughter.</p>
<p><img src="/library/bio/mad-science/timothy-leary/Cwithleary3.gif" height="240" width="320" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">In 
  1970, he declared himself a candidate for governor of California - but the campaign 
  was cut short after he got arrested for drug possession. He and family members 
  were pulled over by an arresting officer with a reputation for planting drugs 
  on suspects. When Leary's traveling companions were searched, the cops found 
  hash and acid tabs. Leary pled no contest to possession of marijuana so authorities 
  would go lighter on his family.</p>
<p>A trial in the most conservative county in California (and home of <a href="/library/bio/presidents/richard-m-nixon/">Richard M. Nixon</a>) yielded a sentence of <b>thirty years in prison</b> for Dr. Leary, 
  an offense normally warranting six months probation. During the appeal process, 
  Leary was sent directly to jail. Astonishingly, he was given a prison psychological 
  test largely based on his own research, and experts came to the conclusion that 
  Leary appeared "healthy" enough to be transferred to a minimum security 
  prison in San Luis Obispo.</p>
<p>Leary promptly <i>escaped. </i>He hoisted himself to the rooftop, climbed up 
  a telephone pole, shimmied along a cable across the prison yard, and dropped 
  over barbed wire to the highway below. He was smuggled out of the country with 
  a fake ID. He was arrested <img src="/library/bio/mad-science/timothy-leary/liddy.jpg" height="240" width="268" width="268" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"> several 
  years later, extradited from Switzerland, and returned to a jail on U.S. soil. 
  At this point Leary decided he'd rather snitch on his accomplices than serve 
  time. He helped finger the man who helped him escape from jail, recounted the 
  escape plot, and implicated numerous others from Los Angeles and Seattle. Nothing 
  led to a criminal arrest, and his sentence was reduced to three years.</p>
<p>Upon release, Leary discovered his popularity had waned. He entered the lecture 
  circuit as a self-proclaimed high priest of the psychedelic movement, and continued 
  to evangelize recreational drug use. Joining him at the podium was convicted 
  Watergate felon <a href="/library/bio/misc/g-gordon-liddy/">G. Gordon Liddy</a>, and together the two embarked upon a modest 
  debating tour, appearing on college campuses from coast to coast. The reviews 
  were mixed, and critics lamented the fact that Leary, a former Harvard professor, 
  was now a nightclub comedian.</p>
<p>He was fifty-six years old with no home, no job, no credit, and dwindling credibility. 
  He moved to Los Angeles, and started socializing in Hollywood circles, a natural 
  evolution for those attempting to alter perception. He believed that Hollywood 
  and the Internet would be the LSD of the 90's, empowering people on a massive 
  scale. </p>

His lectures became multi-media extravaganzas with live video and music, entitled 
  "Just Say Know". His books became graphic novels, focusing on the 
  World Wide Web. He increased his daily diet to consist of 30 cigarettes, one 
  marijuana biscuit, one bonghit, half a cup of coffee, and a great deal of nitrous 
  oxide.</p>
<p>Dr. 
  Leary died of inoperable <a href="/library/death/maladies/cancer/prostate/">prostate cancer</a>, and he'd planned an elaborate death 
  ritual for himself. He'd set up webcams where fans of his work could watch him 
  commit suicide in real time. Instead he died in his sleep, uttering the <a href="/library/death/last-words/">last 
  words</a>: "why not."</p>
<p>Later, his ashes were loaded into the same 9x12 inch canister containing the 
  remains of <a href="/library/culture/star-trek/">Star Trek</a> creator <a href="/library/bio/artists/gene-roddenberry/">Gene Roddenberry</a> and blasted into space on 
  the Pegasus Rocket.</p>
