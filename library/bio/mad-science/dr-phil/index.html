<h1>Dr. Phil</h1>
<p>In 1996, when Oprah Winfrey was being sued by Texas cattle ranchers who claimed 
  she'd defamed the entire beef industry during an hour-long broadcast about Mad 
  Cow disease, her credibility and career were at stake -- not to mention $12 
  million in damages. Oprah's version of the truth wouldn't be worth half a tubesteak 
  unless it was communicated to the judge and jury effectively.<br>
  <br>
  Toward that end, she hired Courtroom Sciences Inc., a trial preparation and 
  consulting firm whose clients have included Exxon (during the Valdez oil spill 
  trial), The New York Times, and other Fortune 500 companies. The president and 
  co-founder of CSI is Philip Calvin McGraw, a man known to millions of obese, 
  desperate individuals and profoundly fucked-up families as <b>Dr. Phil.</b> 
</p>
By analyzing jurors, examining "food disparagement" laws, and studying 
witnesses' mental mechanics, Dr. Phil advised Oprah on how her case should best 
be presented. CSI prepared mock trials, trained witnesses, and conducted community 
attitude surveys. Behavioral scientists and multi-disciplinary experts studied 
<img src="phoprah.jpg" width="329" height="233" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">thousands 
of cases in an attempt to understand what jurors respond to, how they retain information, 
and why they reach a verdict. <br>
<br>
After five weeks of testimony, Winfrey walked out of the courtroom with her dignity 
more or less intact, and the DNA of Madame Oprah and Dr. Phil were inextricably 
linked for life. Their good cop / bad cop talk show routine kicked off in style: 
Dr. Phil was rewarded with appearances as a regular guest on her daytime program. 
His new title? <b>Relationship and Life Strategy Expert.</b><br>
<br>
After three bestselling books, he secured his own Oprah-produced platform. The 
<i>Dr. Phil</i> show debuted in 97 percent of U.S. television markets, and generally 
airs directly before or after - but never against - <i>Oprah</i>. Floundering 
TV stations like the newly independent KRON-4 (pronounced "kron-fu") 
in the San Francisco Bay Area showcase no fewer than <b>ten hours</b> of <i>Dr. 
Phil</i> during coveted morning and evening primetime slots five days a week. 
How's that working for them? Just great, as it turns out. Crazy cash spends just 
like regular cash. 
<p><img src="makeup.jpg" width="298" height="252" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Women 
  just can't help themselves; they love this guy to death. At 6-foot-4 and 235 
  pounds, Dr. Phil specializes in blunt force wake-up calls which help people 
  "get real" and change their lives. He's like a cowboy wrapped up inside 
  a therapist, snuggled and hugged in a dream within a dream, smothered thrice 
  times over in the syrupy secret sauce of sweet, sensible success. Guests of 
  <i>Dr. Phil</i> are placed front and center on a wide circular stage, with literally 
  nowhere to hide. They're wedged tightly in what look to be giraffe-height wooden-backed 
  baby chairs, legs dangling uncomfortably in the awkward, empty space above an 
  entire audience of looky-loos, many of whom spend the full hour doing nothing 
  more than peering up a guest's skirt.<br>
  <br>
  "I've been keeping my eye on this guy," says <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/comic/david-letterman/">David Letterman</a>. 
  "He's a magician or a psychiatrist or something. I think Oprah was married 
  to Dr. Phil, and Dr. Phil helped Oprah when she was going to prison. The guy's 
  a goofball. He's just a big dopey guy."</p>
<p>"Dr. Phil doesn't like the fact that we actually expose him for being 
  a wacko," Howard Stern says. "He's a car salesman." </p>
<p>Critical viewers roll their eyes whenever Dr. Phil quotes from his own personal 
  library of down-home good ol' boy Texas yokelisms, obscure combinatorics of 
  sensible nouns and mundane activities. <i>Sometimes it's hard to see your face 
  without a mirror,</i> for example. Or, <i>People with nothing to hide hide nothing.</i> 
  Or, <i>Put that on the cover of the Duh Journal.</i> Or even, <i>You're only 
  lonely if you're not there for you.<br>

<p>Each season, Dr. Phil plucks from the wilderness the most fragmented family 
  his staffers can find. Cameras roll as he delivers them <i>en masse</i> toward 
  stability and enlightenment over the course of an entire season. Emotionally 
  vacuous, ice cold mothers married to philandering, gambling-addicted fathers 
  of pregnant, pie-faced fifteen year-old girls are not uncommon on the set.</p>
<p>What sets <i>Dr. Phil</i> guests apart from the cousin-fucking backwater bumpkin 
  trailer trash regularly lampooned on <i>Ricki Lake</i>, <i>Springer</i> or <i>Maury 
  Povich</i> is that Phil's guests are qualified, <i>legitimately</i> fucked up 
  <b>normal people.</b> They're not eunuchs or convenient punchlines, but rather 
  middle-to-upper-class American dopes doing their best to live a "perfect" 
  life. Here are people in truly terrible shape, with very little insight about 
  how to be happy, and far fewer ways to excuse their behavior. They're not on 
  medication, they're not mentally ill. Everyone on the Dr. Phil program is <b>lazy, 
  a crybaby, or somewhere in between</b><b>.</b><img src="profile.jpg" width="277" height="358" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></p>
<p><i>"Marilyn is married, with a 12-year-old daughter. Recently she discovered 
  that her husband of 13 years has been cheating on her during most of their marriage. 
  He is so unhappy with her weight of 347 pounds that he's embarrassed to introduce 
  her to his friends and co-workers."</i></p>
<p><img src="phil_image.jpg" width="125" height="389" align="right">"You're 
  going to have to come to grips with that," Dr. Phil tells her. "And 
  if you don't want to do that, then don't do this. There's nowhere to run, nowhere 
  to hide. You're going to get real about fat, or you're going to get real fat."</p>
<p>Yes, Dr. Phil's most recent title is Lord of the Fat. But Sally Smith, 374-pound 
  editor of <i>Big Beautiful Woman</i> magazine, and Maryanne Bodolay, 400-pound 
  executive administrator of the <i>National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance</i> 
  are two former guests of Dr. Phil who have come forward to denounce him as a 
  fraud. They'd hoped to change the good doctor's philosophy that being fat is 
  a psychological flaw which can be overcome with willpower alone. Before they 
  appeared on the show, producers sent them on an undercover mission in Las Vegas. 
  A hidden camera followed them around in the hopes that strangers would ridicule 
  them because of their weight.</p>
<p>Nobody did, so the crew moved the ladies to Los Angeles and sat them in a restaurant 
  next to two diners known to dislike fat people. Nothing happened there, either 
  -- but when the show aired in November, viewers saw Maryanne and Sally visiting 
  a mall, a fitness center and a buffet restaurant. Hidden-camera footage showed 
  onlookers snickering -- supposedly at the overweight ladies. At different times 
  in the restaurant, one man asked, "Is that fat-free ice cream?" and 
  another told the women, "Leave some for somebody else!" To add insult 
  to injury, producers telephoned the women weeks after the show aired, asking 
  them to make a <i>return</i> appearance because the first show won tremendous 
  ratings.</p>
<p><img src="jaybook.jpg" width="309" height="467" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">As 
  if one Phil McGraw wasn't enough, out squirts <b>Jay McGraw</b>, Dr. Phil's 
  son -- ready, willing and able to step up and <i>get real </i>about piggybacking 
  on the success of his dad. A student at Southern Methodist University with impish 
  tufts of Giovanni Ribisi facial hair (and a dead ringer for all the freakish 
  members of the Backstreet Boys smashed together), Jay has somehow managed to 
  auteur <b>four books</b> intended for teens, each of which has landed on the 
  New York Times bestseller list. Chief among them is <i>Closing the Gap: A Strategy 
  for Bringing Parents and Teens Together.</i></p>
<p>"Parents, your sons and daughters are in danger!" shrieks Dr. Phil 
  at the start of Jay's book. "If you're a parent, grandparent or teenager, 
  you are <b>infected with a very serious disease.</b> It is not a disease of 
  biological origin, it does not attack the tissues of your body, but it <i>is</i> 
  a disease - an acute social disease which attacks the fiber of your family. 
  The danger is <i>real;</i> it is <i>right now</i> and it spans the physical, 
  mental, emotional and spiritual realms. Teens, whether you think so or not, 
  you are in trouble here, and your parents are confused - or even worse - totally 
  lost about how to help. The disease is one of disconnection, distraction, and 
  fragmentation." </p>
<p>And then Jay starts pounding the keyboard, doing his best to fit in with today's 
  young people. "Are you as tired as I am of books constantly telling you 
  the same old Brady Bunch, Beaver Cleaver, goody-two-shoes BS about doing your 
  best to understand your parents, doing your homework, making curfew, getting 
  a haircut, dropping that hemline, and blah blah blah?" Hemlines? Curfews? 
  Goody-two-shoes? <i>Beaver Cleaver?</i> When was the last time any of those 
  words crossed a teen's vocabulary? Talk about a never-ending cycle of <b>disconnection, 
  </b>daddy-o. Why not just bring up Warm Fuzzies and Cold Pricklies? As Oprah 
  plugs Phil, Phil plugs Jay, Jay plugs his books, each book plugs the websites 
  (as a resource for "meaningful discourse") and splashed across all 
  the websites are plugs for Oprah</p>
<p>What nobody plugs is that a former patient of Dr. Phil has come forward to 
  claim he sexually abused her in the early 1980's. She filed charges with the 
  Texas State Board of Examiners and Psychologists, who reprimanded him in 1989 
  for "hiring the woman too soon after she was a patient," citing an 
  inappropriate dual relationship. Dr. Phil took a lie detector test to prove 
  his innocence - and he passed - but he "can't remember" exactly who 
  administered the test.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="gulp.jpg" width="184" height="258" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Under 
  a licensing deal with <b>CSA Nutraceuticals</b> (whatever the Christ those are) 
  Dr. Phil has lent his name and grinning <i>thumbs-up</i> clip art of himself 
  to a line of nutritional supplements: vitamin packets, power bars and meal-replacement 
  shakes available at <i><b><img src="yum.jpg" width="184" height="259" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></b></i>Wal-Mart, 
  Walgreens and Target. Unlike diet books or videotapes, these products can <b>actually 
  be placed in the mouth, chewed up, swallowed, digested and subsequently excreted. 
  </b>While shoppers' hands might otherwise tremble mere inches away from <i>Ricki 
  Land-O-Lakes</i> whipped buttery topping spread or the ever popular <i>Jerry 
  Snickers</i> breakfast bar, let's remember that the "doctor" in <i>Dr. 
  Phil</i> references a degree in <b>psychology.</b> He's not a physician, he's 
  not academically qualified to prescribe medication, let alone foodstuffs or 
  any product conveniently located in your grocer's pastry case.<br>
  <br>
  Furthermore - if you can believe this - Dr. Phil believes so strongly in slimming 
  down the national waistline that he doesn't consider these endorsement deals 
  "commercial" ventures. Perhaps that's a fair assessment, considering 
  several members of Dr. Phil's own family are obese (in the 400-500 pound range), 
  and both his mother-in-law and father died of wheezing, fat-related traumas. 
  Not even Oprah has licensed her name or likeness to a product (apart from the 
  tepid <i>"O" </i>magazine), nor has she insisted upon royalties from 
  the authors or publishers connected with her Book Club selections.</p>
<p> <img src="9a.jpg" width="350" height="265" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">So 
  Dr. Phil is a controversial behaviorist among therapists. Big deal. One camp 
  sees him as an emotional hustler who's turned serious psychotherapy into a sideshow, 
  tearing down defenses and offering nothing in return. Others say Phil is doing 
  a service by showcasing dysfunctional couples to the world and chastising them 
  to snap out of it.</p>
<p><img src="lovedrphiltee230.jpg" width="178" height="230" align="left">One 
  side-effect of Oprah giving birth to Dr. Phil was the inevitable onslaught of 
  <b>I LOVE DR. PHIL</b> merchandise and paraphernalia, the <i>least</i> of which 
  can be described as pop philosophy or a self-help references. His web site boasts 
  information "not necessarily created or approved by a certified mental 
  health professional," and content "not created by Dr. Phil or any 
  other certified mental health professional."</p>

<p><img src="fold.jpg" width="230" height="230" align="right"><img src="drphillstore.gif" width="163" height="97" align="left">Or 
  might you be better off with a nickel-plated <b>I LOVE DR. PHIL</b> Accordion 
  Tri-Fold Mini Photo Template Frame? What better way to help your emotionally 
  distant father showcase embarrassing soccer portraits of you at age eleven.

  hairdo and gawky, protruding headgear which makes your face look like a roller 
  coaster. Only $15.99, plus shipping and fondling.</p>
<p>And hey mom, we can't forget about you. Everyone in our rinky-dink middle America 
  huckleberry farming community knows you like to drive into town pitch-black, 
  fall-down drunk. So here's an <b>I LOVE DR. PHIL</b> silver keychain, packaged 
  in a gift box and suitable for your keys to the tractor, trailer, tractor-trailer, 
  or all of the above. Ten bucks, guaranteed to make today a changing day in your 
  life.</p>
<p>Dear Diary, what I wouldn't give for an <b>I LOVE DR. PHIL</b> spiral-bound 
  notebook so I could jot down each and every last one of my own personal observations 
  during Dr. Phil re-runs. And it's only <b>twelve dollars.</b> My goodness, how 
  will I ever fill up <b>eighty sheets</b> of individually lined paper? Have that 
  many original thoughts even occurred to me over the course of my entire life? 
  Who cares! Add to cart! CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK HONK BONK DUH.<img src="7.jpg" width="350" height="265" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></p>
<p>Clearly it's come to Dr. Phil's attention that a large portion of his stay-at-home 
  audience are desperate shopaholics who suffer from diarrhea of the <b>spend.</b> 
  Do you have similar problems? Are your children vicious potty-mouths, crippled 
  by painfully narcissistic introspection about their <i>Max Payne 2</i> acumen? 
  Is your sixth wife haranguing you about wanting a sixth baby? Were you raised 
  in by wolves who made no secret of the fact that they were hoping for a child 
  of the opposite sex? These days, the only way to get a face-to-face meeting 
  with Dr. Phil is to be a guest on the show. Upcoming topics include <i>I Love 
  You But I Can't Stand Your Kids, Is Your Son Becoming A Woman?</i> and <i>Pretending 
  You're A Different Race To Get Ahead.</i></p>
