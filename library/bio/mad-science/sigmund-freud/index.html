<ul>
<li> Helped found the <a href="/library/conspiracy/tavistock-institute/">Tavistock Institute</a>.
<li> <a href="/library/sex/masturbation/">Masturbation</a>.
<li> <a href="/library/sex/vagina-dentata/">Vagina Dentata</a>.
<li> Cocaine user.
<li> Nazi sympathizer (is this true?) (didn't the Nazis denounce Freud and psychoanalysis?) "My language is German. My culture, my attainments are German. I considered myself German intellectually, until I noticed the growth of anti-Semitic prejudice in Germany and German Austria. Since that time I prefer to call myself a Jew."
<li> Freud's books were burned in Germany by 1933. Said Freud: "What progress we are making. In the Middle Ages they would have burned me. Now they are content with burning my books."
<li> The writing on the wall became more apparent when his daughter, Anna Freud, was interrogated for a full day by the <a href="/library/history/nazi/gestapo/">Gestapo</a>. Before Sigmund was allowed to emigrate, he signed a document that stated he had not been mistreated. His postscript, appended to the document, read "I can most highly recommend the Gestapo to everyone."
<li> Freud left Austria after the <i>Anschluss</i>, to avoid the <a href="/library/history/nazi/">Nazis</a>, to <a href="/library/travel/cities/paris/">Paris</a>; and then departed Paris for England. This was accomplished with the assistance of Marie Bonaparte (of the <a href="/library/bio/historical/napoleon/">Napoleon</a> Bonapartes). While the <i>Bonaparte Papers</i> are in the custody of the Library of Congress, access has never been granted to their scholarship, at the insistence of the Bonaparte heirs, until 2020.
<li> His four sisters, who stayed in Vienna, were murdered in <a href="/library/history/war-crimes/holocaust/">concentration camps</a>.
<li> Committed suicide in 1939, after a long bout with maxillary cancer.
<li> He was cremated, ashes at Golders Green Crematorium in Golders Green.
<li> Anna died in 1982.
<li> Freud's granddaughter Sophie (a doctor in her own right), on Freudian theory: "I think it's such a narcissistic indulgence that I cannot believe in it."
