<h1>Martha Stewart</h1>
<p>
  <i><img src="mdf292347.jpg" width="298" height="450" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">"My 
  dream now, in retrospect then, was to be an eclectic knowledge-gathering person 
  - in order to be able to learn and then to teach. And I'm still doing that, 
  so I think I am a teacher."</i></p>
<p>Don't people have anything better to do than harass<b> Martha Stewart</b> or 
  write extended essays about the vastness of her worldwide enterprise? Without 
  Stewart's guidance, most people would never consider adding Scope or common 
  household Listerine to their <a href="/library/crime/drugs/marijuana/">bongs</a>. But by doing so, each inhale grows mintier 
  and more evenly mentholated than the last. Mouthwash serves to fully neutralize 
  odors found lurking in tubes of glass, plastic, even wood - and it can actually 
  make the monthly cleaning process easier. Furthermore, as you smoke, each puff 
  is drawn through a network of chemicals which prevent precious particulate matter 
  from adhering to the bong's inner walls. You'll aspirate more dope, get five 
  times higher - and that really <b><i>is</i></b> a good thing! So quit your bitching 
  and give her a chance.</p>
<p>Martha Kostyra was born in 1941. Her father was a self-absorbed, alcoholic 
  salesman who sometimes worked as a <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/comic/andrew-dice-clay/">gym coach</a>. His temper made him the most powerful 
  force in her life, setting standards of excellence and intolerance which became 
  dominant characteristics of her own personality. Her mother was a cold, disengaged 
  housewife who got married due to - ahem - an <a href="/library/death/abortion/">unwanted</a> pregnancy. When food was 
  served, Martha and her <a href="/library/sex/incest/">siblings</a> were forced to eat. A disturbing childhood marked 
  by <a href="/library/bio/crime/criminals/darlie-routier/">parental tension</a>, overwhelming resentment and freshly-baked <a href="/library/bio/authors/oscar-wilde/">English muffins</a> 
  is all anyone really needs to know about how Martha Stewart got where she is 
  today.</p>
<p> In college, Stewart set out to study chemistry - but that proved just a <i>lit-tle</i> 
  too boring. She switched to <a href="/library/art/">Art</a>, with an emphasis on European history and architecture. 
  When those subjects proved equally boring, she married a lawyer and tried to 
  become a model. She did television <a href="/library/imagery/subliminal/bbp/">commercials</a> for Breck hair spray,
<img src="story.glamour.jpg" width="220" height="168" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Lady 
  Clairol, Lifebuoy soaps and <a href="/library/medicine/epidemics/sars/">Tareyton cigarettes</a>. In 1965, after <i>modeling</i> 
  proved to be too much of a challenge - she became a mother herself after giving 
  birth to a <a href="/library/hoaxes/temp-agencies/">little girl</a>. </p>
<p>Two years later, Stewart changed her mind again. She set up shop as a <b>stockbroker</b> 
  (her father-in-law's profession) but quit in 1973, after signs that Wall Street 
  was about to experience a brief recession. In 1976, she became a <b>caterer. 
  </b>Jesus Christ! Make up your mind, lady! No wonder everyone wants to hate 
  her. She burned through money faster than a desperate, afghan-wearing soccer 
  mom trying to sell beaded jewelry and fiber art at the mall.</p>
<p>However - her <a href="/library/crime/blood-diamonds/">catering business</a> was successful! In ten short years, she'd accumulated 
  <i>one million dollars!</i> <i><b>Wow! </b></i>Then her husband left her, and 
  married one of her former flower consultants. But instead of turning to <a href="/library/crime/drugs/effects/">drugs</a> 
  or <a href="/library/crime/drugs/overdose-deaths/">alcohol</a> to combat the impending sense of loss, Martha coupled with <b>K-Mart</b>, 
  a struggling retailer with whom she partnered to bring towels, tablecloths, 
  and a warmer sense of style to poor people everywhere. Shortly after their blessed 
  union, K-Mart went bankrupt.</p>
<p><img src="msd.jpg" width="255" height="193" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">It 
  really is a Cinderella story. Stewart's had more influence on how Americans 
  eat, entertain, and decorate their homes than any one woman in the nation's 
  history. She became one of America's wealthiest women by taking her <a href="/library/crime/corporate/microsoft/">Orwellian-named</a> 
  company, <b>Omnimedia Inc.</b> fully public on October 19, 1999. But the company 
  became unprofitable in 2003, and lost millions in market value as customers 
  defected and legal costs climbed. </p>
<p>In the exposé <i>Martha Inc.,</i> veteran financial writer <a href="/library/bio/authors/oscar-wilde/">Christopher 
  Byron</a> characterized Stewart as an extremely short-tempered <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/linda-lovelace/">whore</a> whose attitude 
  grows worse with each passing day. "In essence, the book reads like a litany 
  of horrors," says BusinessWeek associate editor <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/radio/dr-laura-schlessinger/">Diane Brady</a>. "This 
  is a woman whose career path to success is strewn with <a href="/library/bio/dictators/pol-pot/">carcasses</a>."</p>
<p>Place a miniature marshmallow at the bottom of a sugar cone to eliminate ice 
  cream drips. Suck your husband's <a href="/library/sex/castration/">cock</a> each and every morning to prevent divorce 
  proceedings or a broken neck. Chopped-up body parts clogging your bathtub? Pour 
  1/4 cup of <a href="/library/bio/religion/cult/reverend-jim-jones/">baking soda</a> down the drain, add three tablespoons of vinegar. Flush 
  with boiling water, and keep paper towels nearby to absorb the frothy, gurgling 
  backwash.</p>
<p><img src="martha_publishing.jpg" width="324" height="220" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Stewart 
  is now 61 years old. Everything about the former model has come to resemble 
  the prissy, uptight customers often observed lingering like storks at the Neiman 
  Marcus cosmetics counter. She barks instructions at employees like a <a href="/library/bio/religion/mother-teresa/">nun</a> with 
  a yardstick. No manner of adornment or decoration is ever quite good <i>enough</i>, 
  and she regularly exhibits a level of self-hatred bordering on autoerotic self-sadomasochism.</p>
<p>On June 4, 2003, Stewart was named in a nine-count indictment charging her 
  with obstruction of justice and lying to federal investigators in connection 
  with a government probe of insider trading of ImClone stock. Already a multi-millionaire, 
  Martha allegedly walked away from this sale with $229,000 and avoided losses 
  estimated at $45,673. The charges carried penalties of up to 10 years in jail. 
  The subpoena was served up with crispity, crunchety, peanut-buttery asparagus 
  panzanella, and both Stewart and her <a href="/library/bio/crime/serial-killers/elmer-wayne-henley/">former stockbroker</a> pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Hours later, Martha had resigned as chairman and CEO of Omnimedia and criminal 
  proceedings kicked into high gear. The prosecutions's case centered around Stewart's 
  propensity to <b>lie repeatedly</b> to members of the <a href="/library/conspiracy/fbi/">FBI</a>, the SEC, and the 
  U.S. Attorney working out of New York. That very afternoon, Omnimedia (NASDAQ:MSO), 
  plummeted 15 percent, losing $1.68 to $9.52. Meanwhile, ImClone shares <i>soared</i> 
  18 percent (closing at $33.55) due to optimism over <b>Erbitux</b>, an upcoming 
  cancer treatment product slated for over-the-counter distribution and release 
  sometime within the next two hundred thousand years.</p>
<p><img src="msl.jpg" width="450" height="600" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">So 
  Martha Stewart sold a handful of stocks. Big deal. Whether she cooked the books 
  or sauteed them with fresh <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/arnold-schwarzenegger/">Austrian cantaloupe</a> leaves to lay across the skin 
  of pearl mink soup, it's of little consequence. It's not like she was caught 
  concealing <a href="/library/sex/dildos/">missiles</a> from weapons inspectors. Who did she <b>personally injure</b> 
  by acting on a hot tip offered up by a close, personal friend? Everybody does 
  that, for crying out loud. That's how brokers are <b>supposed</b> to operate. 
  Traders and bondsworkers who disregard reasonably credible rumors (which later 
  turn out to be financially lucrative) are <b>fired.</b> It was clear to Stewart's 
  lawyers that homemade potpourri made from fresh orange peel and sun-dried raspberries 
  couldn't mask the frightening aroma of impending doom. They accused the government 
  of bringing the case "because [Stewart] is a woman who has successfully 
  competed in a man's business world by virtue of her talent, hard work and demanding 
  standards," and that the case exists only because of her celebrity status</p>
<p>But this case isn't a war against Martha Stewart - it's a war against festive 
  linens and decorative Thanksgiving <a href="/library/imagery/swastika/">centerpieces</a> adorned with pumpkin spice candles. 
  A lot of people just <i>love that shit.</i> If you go to your girlfriend's house 
  and the whole place smells like the coffee counter at Cost Plus or Pier 1 Imports 
  -- guess what? She's getting <b>laid</b> tonight.</p>
<p>In times of war, America has a proven history of hauling out propaganda meant 
  to illustrate how <i>useful and productive</i> women can be if they'd <b>just 
  stay home. </b>Give them something to do, for Christ's sake. Show them Rosie 
  the Riveter balling up her pantyhose or recycling bobbypins. Show them how Pringles 
  cans stuffed with toilet paper make for a cheaper alternative to <a href="/library/medicine/bodily-functions/menstruation/">tampons</a>. Give 
  the good people of the United States a gentle muscle relaxant like Martha Stewart 
  and stop protesting every goddamn thing in the universe. A pudding isn't a <i>pudding</i> 
  without a little spilt milk.</p>
<p>Martha is unlikely to serve any jail time. She's never going to play mommy 
  dyke in a pretty, <a href="/library/sex/designer-vaginas/">poshly-decorated cell</a>. Nor will she bake multi-layered tiramisu 
  with a nail file hidden inside. This blemish on Stewart's career will be equal 
  in value to the scandals which briefly flew in the face of <a href="/library/bio/crime/serial-killers/jeffrey-dahmer/">Kato Kaelin</a>, Donna 
  Rice, <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/child-stars/michael-lookinland/">Mike Lookinland</a> - or any celebrity in recent memory who's navigated 
  his or her way around justice. It's a stain functionally equivalent to drippy, 
  spicy salsa or a splop of chocolate ice cream down the front of a blue smock. 
  Only <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/marilyn-chambers/">Ivory soap</a> (with its mild, neutral pH) and a horsehair bristlebrush has 
  the power to make everything come clean.</p>
