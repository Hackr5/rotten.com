<p>
  Jeffery Skilling became the COO of the <a href="/library/crime/corporate/enron/">Enron Corporation</a> in 1990, pushing a 
  strange idea: the company didn't really need any "assets". By pushing 
  the company's aggressive investment strategy, he helped make Enron the nation's 
  biggest wholesaler of gas and electricity, with $27 billion traded in the first 

  quarter. He became the CEO, and personally earned $132 million in a single year.</p>

<p>A decade later, he resigned as chief executive, for "personal" 
  reasons. He openly admitted that he was stunned by Enron's horrific descent 
  and by revelations that his former chief financial officer (and right-hand man) 
  made more than $30 million from dealings with investment partnerships barely 
  related to the company. Thousands of employees were left without jobs and retirement 
  savings when Enron imploded in the fall of 2002. As multiple federal investigations 
  loomed, former employees talked of shredding documents related to the collapse. 
  When stories of continued shredding persisted, Enron posted security guards 
  at its offices to stop possible further destruction of documents. Enron's bankruptcy 
  filing was the biggest in U.S. history, encouraging former vice chairman 
  Cliff Baxter to commit <a href="/library/death/suicide/famous/">suicide</a>.</p>
<p><img src="skilling1.jpg" width="375" height="238" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Skilling 
  was described by others as an intense, hands-on manager who let no detail of 
  his sprawling empire escape his reach -- but when it came time to testify for 
  three hours before a cranky House Energy and Commerce Committee, he painted 
  quite a different picture. He portrayed himself as a distant, uninformed figure 
  who had no idea that millions of dollars of debt were being stashed away in off-the-books 
  partnerships. Enron was so big, he claimed, there would be no way he could possibly 
  know about <i>everything</i> going on in the company. "When I left on August 
  14, I thought the financial reports accurately represented the financial state 
  of the company," he said. "I fervently believed that Enron would continue 
  to be successful in the future -- I did not believe the company was in any imminent 
  financial peril."</p>
<p>James Greenwood, subcommittee chairman, said: "Mr Skilling, a massive 
  earthquake struck Enron right after your departure. People in far inferior positions 
  to you could see cracks in the walls, feel the tremors, feel the windows rattling. 
  And you want us to believe that you sat there in your office and had no clue 
  that this place was about to collapse?"</p>
<p>Skilling's responses were overarching excuses which included "I was not 
  aware," "I did not believe," "I did not have any knowledge," 
  -- but went well beyond the traditional "I do not recall". At one 
  point he spun a charming anecdote about power outages in a West Palm Beach, 
  Florida hotel, where executives -- including himself -- wandered in and out 
  of the session while colleagues sat in the dark. It was during these "step 
  outs," Skilling mused, that decisions must have been made without his knowledge, 
  specifically those which led to Enron's downfall. It's easy to see how he earned 
  the nickname of The CEO Who Wasn't There. He has since been charged with fraud, 
  insider trading and other crimes -- and posted his $5 million bond with a cashier's 
  check. </p>
<p><img src="skilling.jpg" width="416" height="262" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">But 
  people did manage to find Skilling, and share their opinions with him. At the 
  beginning of his speech to the Commonwealth Club of California, a sloppy pie 
  with red cherry filling was heaved at him by an activist. He wiped the pie from 
  his face and head, and as <a href="/library/travel/cities/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a> police escorted the pie-thrower from 
  the meeting, Skilling began his lecture entitled "The Roles and Responsibilities 
  of the Energy Industry."</p>
<p>At 4:00 a.m. on April 9, 2004, New York police officers responding to a complaint 
  that an emotionally disturbed person was "pulling on people's clothes and 
  shouting aloud with intent to annoy" found themselves face to face with 
  none other than the former Enron CEO. Skilling was standing on the corner of 
  Park Avenue and East 73rd Street: highly intoxicated, uncooperative, and making 
  accusations at passers-by.</p>
<p>"You're an FBI agent and you're following me," he was reported as 
  shrieking. He ran up to several patrons in a Manhattan bar and "pulled 
  open" their clothes. Police took Skilling to the New York Presbyterian 
  Hospital for observation.</p></p>
