<h1>Howard Hughes</h1>

When the <a href="/library/conspiracy/cia/">CIA</a> needs to spend $200M (<i>in 1970 dollars</i>) to recover a <a href="/library/history/espionage/glomar-explorer/">wrecked Soviet submarine</a> three miles below the ocean's surface, which insane billionaire do they call? Yes, the same one that owned most of Las Vegas' casinos, slept with far too many gorgeous Hollywood movie stars, and wore tissue boxes on his feet to keep germs away. Can you survive on a diet of Hershey bars and milk and remain sane? We say yes!
<p>

Documents released by the DOE in 1997 indicate that Hughes once complained to Vice President Hubert Humphrey about underground atomic bomb tests occurring just 70 miles away from his <a href="/library/travel/cities/las-vegas/">Las Vegas</a> casinos. In response, the Atomic Energy Commission promised that Hughes would receive <strong>bomb blueprints</strong> for his engineers to study. As far as can be determined, this promise was not kept.
<p>

Became a billionaire (and the world's richest man) in 1966.
<p>

Bigtime financial contributor to the <a href="/library/bio/presidents/richard-m-nixon/">Richard M. Nixon</a> campaigns. Donated $100,000 to Nixon's slush fund. Without Hughes, <a href="/library/history/political-scandal/watergate/">Watergate</a> likely would never have reached the point where it would topple a Presidency. Yet these were side effects of what Hughes was doing, never the intent: during the entire Watergate crisis, Hughes remained largely unaware of the events around him.
<p>

In his final days, Hughes surrounded himself with <a href="/library/religion/mormonism/">Mormons</a>. He let his hair and fingernails grow out, never trimming them. He gave up brushing his teeth, which rotted away and fell out on his nonstop diet of candy and cake. He was deathly afraid of other people's germs, but not his own. For more than two decades he remained in seclusion, barely coming out to debunk the fake <a href="/library/hoaxes/hughes-diary/">Howard Hughes Autobiography</a>, and even then only over the telephone.
<p>

Despite his (semi-) anal attitude toward health, he took intravenous drugs. In fact, when his body was x-rayed it revealed dozens of needle tips broken off in his arms and legs.
<p>

After Hughes' death numerous false  <a href="/library/hoaxes/howard-hughes-wills/">Howard Hughes Wills</a> appeared.
