<h1>Hunter S. Thompson</h1>

Author, <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i> and <i><a href="/library/culture/hells-angels/">Hells Angels</a></i>.
<p>

Devoted fan of the <a href="/library/bio/pornographers/mitchell-brothers/">Mitchell Brothers</a> O'Farrell Theater; even had business cards printed up which read:

In 1970 Thompson ran for Sheriff of Pitkin County, Colorado on the Freak Power ticket. He announced that he would spearhead several reforms:
<p>

<ol>
<li>rename Aspen to "Fat City, Colorado"
<li>tear up the downtown streets and replace them with bike paths
<li>decriminalize drug possession
<li>decriminalize the sale of drugs (but only at cost)
<li>reintroduce the stocks for drug dealers working at profit
</ol>
<p>

As the Republican sheriff he was running against sported a crew cut, Thompson shaved his head bald and referred to the other candidate as <i>my long-haired opponent</i>. Even so, he lost the election.
<p>

Scored a one-on-one interview with <a href="/library/bio/presidents/richard-m-nixon/">Richard M. Nixon</a>, on the condition that they would only discuss football.
<p>

There have been two Hollywood attempts to turn Hunter's writings into movies. The first, <I>Where the Buffalo Roam</i> starring Bill Murray, was an astounding failure. However, it did have one unintended effect: in hanging around with Thompson for a while, it turned Murray into an unrepetant jerk for a good amount of time after production wrapped, affecting his relationship/interaction with the <a href="/library/culture/snl/">Saturday Night Live</a> production.
<p>

The second attempt, <I>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i>, was more successful, with the efforts of Terry Gilliam and Johnny Depp providing a near-exact portrayal of the novel. 
<p>

"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me."
<p>

<a href="/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">George W Bush</a> once attended a Superbowl party hosted by Thompson, back in his <i>cocaine days</i>.
