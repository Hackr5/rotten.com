<h1>Geraldo Rivera</h1>

<p><i>Geraldo, a media pinhead,<br>
  Got a shocking surprise from a skinhead.<br>
  Through the air / came a chair<br>
  Which impacted him square.<br>
  His nose got banged up and his chin bled.</i></p>
<p>In November of 1988, the <i>Geraldo</i> daytime talk show achieved its highest 
  ratings ever in over thirteen million homes. <i>Young Hate Mongers</i> featured 
  John Metzger of the Aryan Youth Movement, and Robert Heick of the National Front 
  (both white), Roy Innis of the Congress of Racial Equality (black), rabbi A. 
  Bruce Goldman (Jewish), and a New Jersey couple who claimed they'd been attacked 
  and terrorized by skinheads. Sitting in the audience was an army of neo-Nazi 
  skinheads representing National Resistance. </p>
<p>Metzger 
  complained about "kikes" and called Innis an "uncle Tom." 
  Innis walked over to Metzger, and placed his hands around the boy's neck. Pandemonium 
  broke out in the studio, and within seconds Rivera was suffering from a broken 
  nose - an injury inflicted by a chair was smashed across his face by Metzger's 
  bodyguard.</p>
<p><img src="color.jpg" width="90" height="140" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right"> Throughout the program, young white supremacists were taunted and goaded, 
  being called "a bunch of young clowns." Rivera warned them not to 
  push him too hard. Calling his guests "hate mongers," and using cockroach 
  metaphors was Rivera's rhetorical strategy, and it certainly resulted in a brawl. 
  Geraldo stood back and watched the violence ensue, until a chair flew across 
  the room and collided with his face. Geraldo stepped into the ring and fought 
  back well, throwing some terrific punches.</p>
<p><img src="Geraldo.jpg" width="200" height="237" hspace="10" vspace="4" align="left">Geraldo 
  Rivera is often observed defending his professional reputation and journalistic 
  sensibilities. In 1986 he hosted the nationally-broadcast special, <i>The Mystery 
  of <a href="/library/bio/crime/mafia/al-capone/">Al Capone</a>'s Vault.</i> With dramatic flair, he fired a submachine gun 
  through the wall of the second floor gymnasium at the Lexington Hotel in Chicago, 
  with the potential discovery of dead bodies, jewels, or historical artifacts. 
  Inside the vault was a pile of dirt and one (1) beer bottle, the television 
  equivalent of a pie in the face.</p>
<p> <img src="geraldorivera.jpg" width="211" height="170" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right">Rivera 
  aired a story for Fox News about American soldiers who were killed abroad by 
  friendly fire during a US bombing raid. Rivera intoned the Lord's Prayer and 
  described the site as ''hallowed ground''. The problem was, David Foklenfilk 
  of <i>The Baltimore Sun </i>discovered Rivera had been hundreds of miles away 
  during the incident. The Fox News Channel concluded that Rivera had made a regrettable 
  error. Geraldo defended his reporting as ''an innocent mistake'' in which he 
  mistook ''the carnage in Tora Bora'' for the bloodshed in Kandahar. He also 
  presented evidence that another friendly-fire attack took place in Tora Bora, 
  from where he delivered his disputed report.</p>
<p>Later, on <i>Live With Regis and Kelly</i>, Rivera suggested that Folkenfilk 
  was suffering from penis envy.</p>
<p>
In March of 2003, while on assignment covering the war in Iraq, Geraldo was told by American military officials that he was no longer welcome to accompany U.S. soldiers. It turns out that during an on-air appearance, he'd drawn a map in the sand revealing sensitive information about U.S. troop locations. </p>
