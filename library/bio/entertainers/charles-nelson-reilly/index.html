  Nelson Reilly</h1>
<p><i>"When I die, it's going to read, 'Game Show Fixture Passes Away'. Nothing 
  about the theater, or Tony Awards, or Emmys. But it doesn't bother me."</i></p>
<p> <b>Charles Nelson Reilly</b> (b. January 11, 1931) is indeed a cult figure 
  best known as the wisecracking celebrity panelist on 1970s game show series 
  <i>Match Game.</i> He was the guy on the upper right, the one smoking a hornpipe 
  and wearing a captain's hat, breezy ascot, and oversize coke-bottle glasses.</p>
<p>Reilly grew up in the Bronx. His mother was a belligerent Swede who rarely left 
  the house without a baseball bat. She had ethnic slurs for nearly every race, 
  and she'd shout them regularly from the safety of her apartment window. His 
  father was a henpecked Irish Catholic, a brush artist for movie posters at Paramount 
  studios. When the studio started hiring photographers to design their posters, 
  brush artists fell out of favor. Charles' father lost his job and became an 
  alcoholic.</p>
<p>Charles was, admittedly, a weak child in a tough neighborhood. A sickly, nearsighted 
  boy, he'd climb into his mother's sewing basket and create puppet shows. He 
  had no interest in sports, and he wasn't always able to hide the mannerisms 
  and persona which marked him unmistakably as homosexual -- earning him the nickname 
  of "Mary" from his immediate peer group.</p>
<p><img src="chucktongue.jpg" width="300" height="226" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">At 
  age nine, he got the lead in a school play about Christopher Columbus. His teacher 
  told his mother that Charles was the only true actor she'd ever known. When 
  he was eleven, he and a friend went to the circus in Hartford, Connecticut and 
  a fire started under the circus tent. Reilly and his friend escaped, but 168 
  people, including many children, died in the stampede to evacuate. For this 
  reason, Charles hasn't sat in an audience for anything -- including a movie 
  -- since July 6, 1944. He decided to work backstage instead, and by the time 
  he was 18, he was studying with Uta Hagen. His classmates included Jack Lemmon, 
  Charles Grodin, Gene Hackman, Shelley Berman and Jason Robards.</p>
<p>"They couldn't act for shit!" Reilly remembers. "They stunk! 
  If we had to watch Hal Holbrook and Steve McQueen do the brothers scene from 
  <i>Death of a Salesman </i>once more, we'd go out of our minds!'"</p>
<p><img src="Charles_5.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Between 
  1950 and 1960, he landed parts in twenty-two off-Broadway shows, including minor 
  roles in <i>Bye Bye Birdie</i>, serving as the understudy for Dick Van Dyke 
  and <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/paul-lynde/">Paul Lynde</a>. As Bud Frump in the Pulitzer Prize-winning musical <i>How to 
  Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,</i> he earned a Tony Award -- and 
  in 1964, he received the New York Critic's Circle award for his work as juvenile 
  lead Cornelius Hackel in <i>Hello, Dolly</i>. Herald Tribune critic Walter Kerr 
  wrote, "If I see Mr. Reilly's young, energetic face in one more opening 
  number, I'm going to be sick."</p>
<p><img src="page1_image003.jpg" width="178" height="229" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">When 
  Dick Van Dyke left <i>Bye Bye Birdie,</i> he was replaced by Gene Rayburn, later 
  the host of <i>Match Game</i> and long-time friend of Charles. As <i>Match Game</i> 
  grew in popularity, Reilly was invited onto <i>TattleTales</i> and <i>Hollywood 
  Squares</i> -- and somehow he ended up on every game show in town. He became 
  a bigger personality than an actor. <img src="page1_image009.jpg" width="168" height="134" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">One 
  night in the early 1970s, he realized that he was going to be appearing on game 
  shows 27 times that week. "I was told years ago that I would never be allowed 
  on television," he recalls. "Now I had to try to find out who you have to fuck 
  to get off."</p>
<p>When the BIC ballpoint pen manufacturer decided to roll out their new product, 
  the BIC Banana Pen, they singled out Reilly as the only man who could possibly 
  deliver their urgent message to consumers. As chief spokesman, Mr. Reilly dressed 
  up in an bright yellow banana costume and pranced about the neighborhood, singing 
  and shouting maniacally about BIC Banana Ink Crayons.</p>
<p><i><img src="whodoo3.jpg" width="311" height="237" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Oh 
  we've gone bananas / for BIC Banana ink crayons / You'll learn to write a lot 
  of ways:</i> "Today I'm going to teach you how to draw with BIC Banana Ink Crayons. 
  See what smooth lines the BIC Banana Ink Crayons make! Oh ho ho! They also make 
  fat lines! See what bright colors BIC Banana Ink Crayons make! [Snorts and huffs] 
  Haw haw haw haw hee hee [fart sounds] hoo hoo hoo hee hee hee! There's so much 
  to learn about coloring and drawing with BIC Banana Ink Crayons at school! After 
  all, I should know! I'm the BIC Banana!" [excitable pansy laughter, fade to 
  black].</p>
<p>Inspired by Reilly's bravura performance, Sid and Marty Kroft (creators of 
  <i>Sigmund and the Sea Monsters,</i> <i>Land of the Lost, Bugaloos </i>and <i>H.R. 
  Pufnstuf</i>) secured him to play the role of the evil villain Horatio J. Hoodoo 
  The Magnificent in their lesser-known creation, <i>Lidsville</i>. Any one of 
  these shows alone is interminable, but somehow Charles Nelson's presence made 
  it palatable. "Doing that show was shit," Reilly recalls. "They 
  were all a bunch of shits."</p>
<p><img src="lids_hodfly1.jpg" width="275" height="198" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Charles 
  is now performing a one-man play, <i>Save it for the Stage: The Life of Reilly</i>, 
  which is ranked by critics among the all-time-greatest single-actor evenings 
  of hilarious, intimate theater. In his show, which approaches three hours in 
  length, he talks about the perception many Americans seem to have that he is 
  no longer among the living.</p>
<p>"They call the box office here at the Irish Repertory Theater," Mr. 
  Reilly says onstage. "We have a lovely treasurer named Jeffrey, and they 
  say, 'Who's playing the part of Reilly in <i>The Life of Reilly</i>?' And he 
  says, 'Charles Nelson Reilly.' And they say, 'He's dead! The tall one with the 
  wig and the big glasses is dead.' So Jeffrey says, 'Yes, madam, he is dead. 
  But he still manages to come in every night at eight.'"</p>
<p>Reilly's partner from 1980, Patrick Hughes III, worked as the dresser in the 
  art department on <i>Witch Hunt,</i> a made-for-TV zombie movie in 1994 featuring 
  Julian Sands, Eric Bogosian, and Dennis Hopper as H.P. Lovecraft. Charles has 
  lived at the Wyndham Hotel on West 58th street in New York for over two decades. 
  His most recent television cameo of note was the character of Josie Chung on 
  an episode of <i>The X-Files.</i></p>
