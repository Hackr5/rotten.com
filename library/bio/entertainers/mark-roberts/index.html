<h1>Mark Roberts</h1>
<p><i>"When you see me with my clothes off, you're gonna laugh."</i><br>
  <br>
  The Germans have a name for streaking, <i>nackerblitz</i> -- which more or less 
  means <b>nude lightning. </b>Tennis games in France, rugby matches in Australia, 
  and cricket matches in the United Kingdom claim the lion's share of unexpected 
  appearances by naked men, while American pride limps dejectedly near last place.</p>
<p>How does one judge the merits of a streak? What criteria has come to be the 
  standards by which quality streaking is measured and quantified by a global 
  population? Is it necessary to disrobe and run across the field at <i>every</i> 
  match -- or is it more important to save your "best" gimmicks for 
  a time when your target stadium is packed with 53,000 people, tight security, 
  and dozens of television cameras? And what if you hate sports? Might there be 
  somewhere more meaningful to conduct a streak?<img src="streaker_100dash.jpg" width="195" height="262" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></p>
<p><img src="robertopel.jpg" width="165" height="120" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Los 
  Angeles sex shop owner Robert Opel streaked all the way from one side of the 
  stage to the other during the 1974 Academy Awards, flashing the peace sign behind 
  David Niven. "The only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping 
  and showing his shortcomings," Niven improvised unsuccessfully. Opel was 
  later murdered during a robbery at his place of business, making him but a footnote. 
  More disgusting than the sight of a naked man is a naked man with corporate 
  advertising painted across his stomach, such as the two Vodafone-sponsored streakers 
  who disrupted a rugby match between New Zealand and Australia in 2002. Vodafone 
  was forced to apologize after it "unw<img src="icehockeyglassstreaker.jpg" width="150" height="198" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">ittingly" 
  sanctioned the act.</p>
<p>Other streakers are not so lucky. When Tim Hurlbut, 21, decided to streak at 
  a Canadian Calgary Flames hockey game, he slipped while climbing over the slick 
  glass railing and fell flat on his neck, knocking himself unconscious on the 
  ice. While being carried off the rink in a stretcher and neck brace, he flashed 
  the double-Metallica sign to the crowd, to boos and jeers. The Hockey News referred 
  to Tim as a "naked buffoon". </p>
<p>It's a common sight: the wobbly TV camera pans along the green grass of a soccer 
  field, capturing a lone naked man waving his arms excitedly and running from 
  the <img src="flamesstreak.jpg" width="150" height="188" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">constables 
  on patrol. By far, the most prolific serial streaker (and the world's most famous 
  naked man) is record-breaking <b>Mark Roberts,</b> <i>(b. December 12, 1964)</i> 
  who has an impressive collection of <b>three hundred </b>full on freak streaks 
  to his name. His most recent accomplishment was on February 1, 2004: a mad dash 
  across the field at Half Time during Super Bowl XXXVII in Houston. He cleverly 
  approached the green while wearing a velcro referee's uniform which aroused 
  no suspicions. Then he tore it off at the 30-yard line and began dancing. This 
  delayed the second-half kickoff in front of a worldwide audience in excess of 
  800 million people, likely setting a new world record. Roberts was immediately 
  tackled by Patriots linebacker Matt Chatham before being carried away by security, 
  and sadly his efforts were overshadowed by Janet Jackson's floppy air-bag tittie 
  scandal. He was charged with criminal trespassing and public intoxication.</p>
<p><img src="three.jpg" width="300" height="364" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Roberts, 
  an unemployed father of three, started streaking in 1993 at a Rugby Sevens tournament 
  in Hong Kong. Under the influence of alcohol and peer pressure, he felt the 
  atmosphere was more like a carnival than a sporting event. He made his way down 
  to the front row of seats, tore off his clothes, and ran onto the pitch. Players 
  stopped in their tracks and stared, allowing Roberts to grab the ball and continue 
  running. The whole stadium rose as one, hands in the air, cheering and clapping. 
  The further he ran down the field, the louder the stadium roared with appreciation. 
  When he got between the goal posts, he felt the full force of everyone cheering 
  at once.</p>
<p>"It was like a wave of heat hitting me. Even the players and referees 
  were laughing. I put my hand in the air and set off to do another length of 
  the pitch on my way back to my seat, feeling like the King of England. I was 
  told by the policeman that I was going to be ejected from the stadium and, as 
  he walked me to one of the tunnels leading outside, the whole stadium started 
  to chant LEAVE HIM ALONE, LEAVE HIM ALONE. It is impossible to describe the 
  feelings that were going through me during all of this. I have never known anything 
  like it. As I looked up, <img src="streaker_soccer.jpg" width="195" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">I 
  saw a guy holding two jugs of Carlsberg who then proceeded to pour them over 
  myself and the copper. It was brilliant! Even the copper couldn't help but laugh. 
  He then walked me to the gate and told me that if he saw me back inside, he 
  would have to arrest me. As soon as I left one gate, I walked back in through 
  another. Nothing was going to spoil this day, I was going back to the carnival. 
  People kept shaking my hand, pouring beer over my head, girls were kissing me, 
  it could not have been better."</p>
<p><img src="five.jpg" width="220" height="490" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">And 
  then Mark Roberts did it again, to twice the applause and twice the enthusiasm. 
  Once again the crowd booed as the stewards marched him off the green, but it 
  was only the beginning of a lifelong streaking career. His antics have disrupted 
  soccer, tennis and rugby matches, golf tournaments, casinos and television shows, 
  local weathermen's broadcasts, the Mister Universe competition and the Miss 
  World pageant.</p>
<p>I<img src="net.jpg" width="298" height="159" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">n 
  2002, he pulled off the three biggest streaks of his life back to back: the 
  men's final at Wimbledon, the Champions League soccer final, and the Commonwealth 
  Games. There, he performed naked a galloping 100-meter dash, prompting a Manchester 
  court to charge him with being a public nuisance. His attorney's defense planned 
  to call each and every one of the 40,000 people in attendance that day, to see 
  if anyone honestly cared one way or another. After viewing an amateur video 
  of the incident, prosecution counsel Jamie Hamilton said he had difficulty in 
  proving the charge because everyone in the crowd was cheering and clapping. 
  Roberts was found not guilty.</p>
<p>He streaked a match featuring Anna Kournikova, with the phrase "only the 
  balls bounce" markered across his chest -- a reference to a brassiere advertisement 
  Anna was doing at the time. She hid her face in shame under a towel. Other banner 
  statements in his arsenal have come to include "The Snack," "Super 
  Bowel," "The 19th Hole" (with an arrow pointing to his backside 
  at golf tournaments) and "General Erection". He frequently makes use 
  of a specially prepared outfit which can tear apart, similar to those used by 
  strippers: "The clothes come off in a split second and I'm off. It's called 
  professionalism."<img src="velcro.jpg" width="750" height="203" vspace="12"><img src="bounce.jpg" width="240" height="310" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Roberts' 
  body has weathered numerous cuts, scrapes and bruises, fifty stitches, a broken 
  toe, two broken ribs, a broken ankle and a broken wrist. There are numerous 
  warrants out for Roberts' arrest: since he's unemployed, he hasn't paid his 
  ongoing fines and sanctions. He's banned from every soccer game in England and 
  Wales. He has restrictions to stay under house arrest every time an English 
  soccer team plays abroad. He's been banned from numerous casinos, and his passport 
  forbids him from <i>ever</i> returning to Hong Kong.</p>
<p> Mark's 69-year-old mother Pat Roberts muses about her son's hobby: "We're 
  out for his birthday last year, and the next thing I know he's standing there 
  stark naked. I'm with friends and I'm like, Mark, put your clothes on. He was 
  a normal kid but all of a sudden he got a little crazy. I think I dropped him 
  on his head or something."</p>
<p>Roberts went before a Houston judge to answer the criminal trespassing charges 
  for his 2004 Super Bowl incident. "I just like to entertain people at the 
  end of the day," he said. "There were 70,000 people at Reliant Stadium 
  -- I think everyone was entertained by my performance. I like to make people 
  laugh and I think I did exactly that." He faces 180 days in jail and a 
  $2,000 fine.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, he continues to dream about someday making it past security 
  guards at the Olympic games. He plans to wear a cape and a wig, and call himself 
  Captain Cock. Marvel Comics has approached him to collaborate on a streaking 
  superhero graphic novel.</p>
