<h1>Nancy Reagan</h1>

<ul>
<li> Born Anne Frances Robbins, renamed to Nancy Davis by a studio.
<li> Wife of President <a href="/library/bio/presidents/ronald-reagan/">Ronald Reagan</a>. Ronald knocked her up before they got married. He called her <i>Mommy</i>. After he got <a href="/library/death/maladies/alzheimers/">Alzheimer's</a>, she became his caretaker.
<li> The last movie she appeared in was <i>Hellcats of the Navy</i>, which she starred in with Ronald.


<li> Hired astrologer Joan Quigley, who had an alarming say in when the President would travel or meet with foreign leaders.
<li> <i>Just say No</i> anti-<a href="/library/crime/drugs/">drug</a> campaign, which failed so miserably that drug use actually <i>increased</i> during her reign.
<li> Guest-starred in an episode of <i>Different Strokes</i> with <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/child-stars/dana-plato/">Dana Plato</a> (now dead from an overdose) and the rest. Thus it may not have been the best choice of show for a lasting anti-drug message.
<li> Undertook an expensive redecoration of the White House, in the midst of a major economic recession.
<li> Had a <a href="/library/medicine/celebrity-deformities/">mastectomy</a>.
<li> "A woman is like a <a href="/library/sex/teabagging/">teabag</a>-- you can't tell how strong she is until you put her in hot water."
<li> If you received a gift from the Reagans, it was probably a unwanted, retread gift that someone had already given them. This is Nancy's doing, not Ronald's.
<li> Black people were not permitted in her parents' home.
</ul>
