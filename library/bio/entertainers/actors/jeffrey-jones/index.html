<td valign=top><font size=-1>From a press release issued by the Los Angeles Police Department: "In November 2001, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) received information from a minor who alleged criminal acts of a sexual nature against 56 year-old Jeffrey Jones. As a result of the allegations, investigators secured and served a search warrant on Jones' residence in November 2001, seizing numerous items of evidence. For several months, detectives from Juvenile Division’s Sexually Exploited Child Unit conducted an extensive investigation into the allegations made against Jeffrey Jones."</font></td>

<td valign=top><font size=-1>Jones pleads no contest to a felony charge of employing a minor for purposes of taking sexual explicit photos. Jones is sentenced to five years probation. The conditions of his settlement include registering as a sex offender, recieving sex offender and drug and alcohol counseling, a bar from possessing child pornography, and a requirement to notify his probation office for any travel outside of California.  "This concludes a really painful chapter in my life. I'm sorry that this incident was allowed to occur. Such an event has never happened before and it will never happen again." Jones' Attorney, Leonard Levine: "He hopes the public understands this was an aberration in his life, one mistake in judgment... just a case about photographs."
