<h1>Brad Pitt</h1>

<i>Meet 
  Joe Black</i> (Universal, 1998) was a horrible, plodding film weighed down by 
  an overwrought sense of importance - but one scene in particular stands out 
  as perhaps the greatest use of special effects in the history of American cinema. 
  Rent this film and watch Jennifer Aniston's husband (or Gwyneth Paltrow's ex-fiance) 
  get smacked upside down and smashed apart by not one, but <i>two</i> cars speeding 
  in opposite directions.</p>
<p><b>The setup:</b> Marcia Gay Hardin meets foppish, doe-eyed Pitt in a coffee 
  shop. They talk, they flirt, they conform 100% to Roger Ebert's textbook definition 
  of a Meet Cute. He says all the right things. She smiles and twists her hair, 
  etcetera and so forth. They confess a mutual attraction toward one another, 
  but part ways all the same. Each glances back over his or her shoulder repeatedly, 
  so slower viewers can wrap their minds around a developing chemistry.</p>
<p>Then it's <b>heartwarming movie magic</b> as Brad Pitt carelessly steps into 
  traffic. The most wonderful thing about this scene is sensing that the special 
  effects crew enjoyed working overtime to ensure this moment wouldn't just be 
  realistic, but indelibly etched in movie-goers' memories.</p>

    <td valign="top"><p>While filming <i>Fight Club</i>, director David Fincher 
        and actor Edward Norton found themselves giggling and rewinding this segment 
        of <i>Meet Joe Black</i> over and over. Says Norton: "I think [Pitt's] 
        getting whacked by the car is the best thing I've seen in years."</p>
      <p>Stunt specifications<b>:</b> Three life-size, lifelike stunt body castings 
        built to withstand repeated collisions with cars and asphalt.<br>
        <br>
        Physical materials: Silicone rubber, soft urethane foam, heavy duty <img src="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/brad-pitt/jb.jpg" height="106" width="79" hspace="10" align="right"> steel 
        armatures, wigs, acrylic eyes, bungees. </p>
      <p>The special effects team known as<b> Anatomorphex </b>(with over 20 years' 
        experience in film and television) was given the job. These are the same 
        folks who created the oversize Jack in the Box head, and even <i>that</i> 
        device is complicated. The 14-inch white fiberglass globe contains a mini 
        lipstick camera embedded in the mask's pointy black nose. The actor who 
        wears the head is fitted with video-vision goggles which enable him to 
        walk, run, ride a bike, or drive a car.</p>
      <p>Anatomorphex first life-casted the face and body of Brad Pitt. Feeling 
        confident the structure would survive repeated, punishing blows, they 
        constructed the head and hands from silicone rubber. The bodies were cast 
        in a dense, flexible, urethane foam over thick steel armatures. Several 
        were made, as they would each get bashed around proper.</p>
      <p> The stunt employed a whipcord system, consisting of a pneumatic pull 
        arm firmly anchored to the ground against a large truck. </p>
      <p>Like a fake Hollywood punch delivered during a bar room brawl, the oncoming 
        minivan never hits the dummy - it only drives by, just missing it from 
        behind. The whipcord itself does all the work. A cable was threaded through 
        a pulley to a condor 30 feet up in the air, then yanked at the base of 
        the body double's neck. The cable was airbrushed out during post production.</p>
      <p><b>WHAM<font size="+2">!</font></b> Brad Pitt gets hit by a van. Take 
        that, you fucking ponce. He flies backwards, up into the air. A sight 
        to behold, to be sure - but it's hardly sufficient. Instead of just landing 
        on the concrete, the arc of his path collides hard and fast with a second 
        vehicle. </p>
      <p><b>BAM<font size="+2">!</font></b> The taxi was already in synchronized 
        motion, intersecting the dummy's arc and knocking the body double back 
        into opposing traffic. The effect was violent and scary to 
        those watching the stunt live on the set. For each shot, the dummy was 
        lined up in the camera. Views shuttled between the video image of Pitt's 
        filmed final position in the street, and the live feed of the dummy.</p>
      <p>"We were concerned about the potential wear and tear these body 
        doubles were going to receive," says Anatomorphex. "We built 
        three full doubles, and an extra head too. We shipped a huge repair kit 
        with us, figuring we could always work on two body doubles while one was 
        filming. We did about two dozen takes and after the first, it became obvious 
        just how durable our 200 lb, steel, silicone and urethane body doubles 
        were. Aside from dusting off the inevitable shattered windshield glass, 
        they required very little work, even after slamming into and skidding 
        across the asphalt. Wow!"</p>
      <p>Silicone rubber is still one of the cornerstones of contemporary Hollywood 
        special effects. Pitt's gray suit showed wear and tear quickly, and the 
        wardrobe people were kept busy stitching sleeves and mending pants.</p>
      <p>During one take, the taxi stunt driver was nearly injured when one of 
        the dummies slammed into the windshield head first - with all its weight 
        behind it. The dummy pushed in the front window to within an inch of the 
        seatbelted driver's face.</p>
      <p>After awhile, the silicone began to show a few signs of abrasion, needing 
        minimal paint touch up. After another take, the team discovered one of 
        the prosthetic eyeballs had popped out.</p>
      <p>They never found the eye - but that's the scene which ended up in the 
        movie. Astute viewers watching <i>Meet Joe Black</i> on DVD can see the 
        eyeball bounce off the screen as Pitt's dummy body collapses in a heap 
        and slides tastefully out of frame.</p>
      <p>Recent use of the body-double-smashed-by-car effect was employed in <a href="/library/history/countries/sweden/">Sweden</a>. 
        A television commercial campaign aimed at minimizing <a href="http://poetry.rotten.com/redlight/" target="_blank">collisions</a> between 
        cars and careless pedestrians shows a man idly talking on his cell phone, 
        then stepping into traffic with disastrous results.</p>
      <p>Brad Pitt once worked at El Pollo Loco, where he was asked to 
        dress up like a chicken.</p>
