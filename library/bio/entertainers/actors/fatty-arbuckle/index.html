<B>Please, if you bring away one idea, one fact from this article, make it this: Fatty Arbuckle was innocent.</b>  In one of those common "I heard it was either this way or that" stories that build up over the years, Arbuckle has had his name dragged through the mud for decades after his innocence was proven. As a result, you hear the name and think "Well, there must have been <i>something</i> there...." 
<p>

Well, there wasn't. And there isn't. Just injustice upon injustice heaped upon an actor who merely knew how to party and have a good time, and who became the unwitting victim in an attempt to sell newspapers.

Accused of raping Virginia Rappe with a Coke bottle in a San Francisco hotel room. Turns out, it was all a sham. But <a href="/library/bio/business/william-randolph-hearst/">William Randolph Hearst</a> milked the story for all it was worth.

We feel that a great injustice has been done him... there was not the slightest proof adduced to connect him in any way with the commission of a crime. He was manly throughout the case and told a straightforward story which we all believe. We wish him success and hope that the American people will take the judgement of fourteen men and women that Roscoe Arbuckle is entirely innocent and free from all blame."</font></td>
