<h1>Paul Lynde</h1>
<p> <i>Jun. 13, 1927 - Jan. 10, 1982</i><br>
  <br>
  At a time when coming out was not a possibility, <b>Paul Edward Lynde</b> 
  relied on a number of excuses which explained away his status as a "confirmed, 
  lifelong bachelor." Often he just told fans his high school sweetheart 
  had broken his heart, suggesting he was still too hurt to begin dating again. 
  He served as Uncle Arthur on <i>Bewitched,</i> opposite Agnes Moorehead's Endora 
  -- a woman he referred to on more than one occasion as "one of the all-time 
  Hollywood dykes". He made arguably homophobic statements in public, telling 
  <i>People</i> magazine in 1976, "My following is straight. I'm so glad. 
  Gay people killed Judy Garland -- but they're not going to kill me."</p>
<p>Lynde himself is among the gayest celebrities the world has ever known. Chronically 
  cranky, sarcastic and mincing, Lynde's career was also defined by his voice 
  work as Templeton the rat in <i>Charlotte's Web</i>, and as the wisecracking 
  centerpiece on television's <i>Hollywood Squares</i>. During his life he served 
  as comedy writer, nightclub performer, Broadway actor and director, recording 
  artist, and television pitchman. The man who made the world "a safer place 
  for sissies," suffered a number of tragedies -- including a constant battle 
  to control his weight, his whisky, and his depression -- which culminated in 
  an isolated, mysterious death in 1982.</p>
<p><img src="092377t.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Born 
  in Mount Vernon, Ohio, Paul Lynde was one of six children. Encouraged by his 
  high school drama coach, he enrolled at Northwestern University's Speech and 
  Drama School, where in 1948 he was declared Best Student Actor of the Year. 
  His humor was very much inspired by the <i>New Yorker</i> cartoons conceived 
  by Charles Addams. Upon graduation, he pursued an acting career in New York 
  without much success. He survived for four years by waiting tables and selling 
  blood for five dollars a pint. On Thanksgiving day in 1950, Paul won an amateur 
  talent contest which led to his first New York nightclub gig. Other successful 
  club dates followed, and soon he was cast in <i>New Faces of 1952</i>, a hit 
  revue which led to comedy roles in the original stage (and later screen) production 
  of <i>Bye Bye Birdie</i>. </p>
<p><img src="Lynde_credit_Funtasia_site.jpg" width="200" height="168" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Lynde's 
  brother died in the Battle of the Bulge -- one of the coldest, snowiest wars 
  in history, and one of the worst battles in terms of losses to American forces 
  in World War II. The process of recovering his body from the war field and bringing 
  him back for a proper burial in the United States spanned five years, during 
  which time the dead soldier was often mischaracterized as "missing in action". 
  Rather than secure the closure which such recoveries provide, the recovery only 
  opened new wounds. Paul's parents both died of stress and anxiety within weeks 
  of each other.</p>
<p>In the wake of this grief, Lynde devoted all his energies to his career. From 
  <i>Bye Bye Birdie</i>, he proceeded to get work on the Disney film <i>Son of 
  Flubber</i> -- the first in a series of character roles which would typecast 
  Lynde as a snide, cynical little nelly. Although he wearied of this treatment 
  and believed that someday he'd be accepted as a "legitimate" actor, 
  his fan base grew exponentially upon witnessing his performance as persnickety 
  Uncle Arthur in <i>Bewitched</i>.</p>
<p><img src="pldating.jpg" width="155" height="353" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><img src="HS1974ad.gif" width="207" height="328" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">In 
  1965, Lynde was vacationing in San Francisco with his 24-year-old companion 
  Jim Davidson. As a prank, up in their hotel room Davidson made frantic flapping 
  gestures as if to suggest he could jump from the balcony -- and while doing 
  so, he slipped and fell many stories to his death. Two police officers standing 
  on the street below saw the whole thing. In a matter of seconds, they were comforting 
  Lynde, who remembers: "They said, 'Don't worry, Paul, we saw it all. If 
  you need us, we'll be here. We're not going to let them wipe you out with this.' 
  They knew it looked strange: he was younger than I was, he was good-looking, 
  and why was he there with me? Why did he jump? Why did he fall?"</p>
<p>After Bewitched was cancelled, Lynde was selected as a game show panelist. 
  He didn't offer "dirty" answers on <i>The Hollywood Squares</i>, he 
  delivered kinky, bitchy responses. He was a regular during its second week in 
  1966 and joined full time in the fall of 1968. Less than a decade later, he 
  left the show after the <i>National Enquirer</i> claimed an "insider" 
  revealed Lynde was fired because of his drinking problem. The source revealed 
  documentation of Lynde's nastiness and implied that his alcoholism created a 
  problem for costars. Even though these facts were common knowledge, Lynde sued 
  the <i>Enquirer</i> for ten million dollars, chiefly to find out who the insider 
  was. The case was summarily dismissed, but it ushered in a new era of tabloid 
  litigation. Some of Lynde's famous quips during <i>Hollywood Squares</i> include:</p>
<p><img src="paul_partyboy.jpg" width="366" height="277" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Q:  
  In the movies, Frankenstein's monster was always big and ugly. And he had lots

  A:  That the girls would be turned off by his big nuts.</p>

  your tent I'll creep."  Who am I?<br>
  A:  The scoutmaster.</p>
<p>Q. Do female frogs croak? <br>
  A: If you hold their little heads under water long enough. </p>
<p>Q: Paul, can you get an elephant drunk? <br>
  A: Yes, but he still won't go up to your apartment. </p>
<p>Q: Prometheus was tied to the top of a mountain by the gods because he had 
  given something to man. What did he give us? <br>
  A: I don't know what you got, but I got a sports shirt. </p>
<p>Q: Is Billy Graham considered a good dresser?  <br>
  A: No, but he's a terrific end table.</p>
<p><img src="paul1a.jpg" width="256" height="192" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Q: 
  Is using an electric vibrating machine a good way to lose weight?<br>
  A: That's what I told the saleslady, but she just winked. </p>
<p>Q: When is it a good idea to put your pantyhose in the microwave oven for two 
  minutes?<br>
  A: When your house is surrounded by the police.</p>
<p>Q: Why do sheep sleep huddled up?<br>

  sticks in your ear?<br>

  or women over thirty?<br>
  A: I don't have a third choice?</p>
<p><img src="paul_opener.jpg" width="334" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Sadly, 
  his best performances on <i>Hollywood Squares</i> were left on the cutting room 
  floor: from time to time he was too drunk or too high on goofballs to read 
  the ghost-written material. He forgot his lines, and when his hateful wisecracks 
  were met with boos from the audience, <img src="paulynde.jpg" width="222" height="98" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Lynde 
  would attempt to climb through the monkeybar set and engage in scuffles with 
  the heckler -- much to the consternation of those in the studio.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the <i>Hollywood Squares</i> gig earned him twice as much money 
  as his costars and got him a short-lived sitcom, <i>The Paul Lynde Show</i>. 
  The series, dismissed by critics for its similarities to <i>All in the Family</i>, 
  had a few novelties going: Lynde got to drink martinis on the show, and the 
  set design was the first of its kind to feature an actual swimming pool.</p>
<p>Where it failed was believability. Lynde was too much of an ambling, shambling 
  queen to play the role of an uptight attorney-slash-family-man. Script writer 
  Ed Jurist noted that "all Lynde had to do was moan 'Oh, my knees' and he'd 
  get a roar." The show was cancelled after one season, throwing Lynde's 
  drinking problem into high gear. Supposedly he was the inspiration for a gag 
  which made its way into the movie <i>Groundhog Day</i>. After a drunken high 
  speed chase through the San Fernando Valley one night, Lynde crashed his car 
  into a mailbox. When the cops rushed the scene with their guns drawn, Lynde 
  lowered his window and ordered a cheeseburger with no onions and a large Sprite.</p>
<p><img src="lyndep.jpg" width="400" height="251" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Between 
  1975 and 1979, Lynde had a number of television specials, none of which had 
  names more exciting than <i>The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour, The Paul Lynde Halloween 
  Special, Paul Lynde: 'Twas The Night Before Christmas, or Paul Lynde Goes MA-A-A-AD.</i> 
  Guests included Levar Burton, Harry Morgan, Vicki Lawrence, Robert Urich, and 
  the irrepressible Charo. An ad in <i>TV Guide</i> referred to one special as 
  "a sensational, side-splitting salute to everything evil, mean, nasty and 
  bad -- as only Paul can do it." His characters included a salacious supermarket 
  clerk, a temperamental guitar instructor with one arm, and a crossing guard.</p>
<p>One night in January of 1982, Paul missed a dinner appointment with a group 
  of long-time friends. Concerned, they rushed to his home on North Palm Drive 
  in Beverly Hills. He was found naked and dead, surrounded by amyl-nitrate poppers, 
  an inhalant used primarily by gay men to enhance sex. His death was ruled a 
  heart attack. Funeral services were held at Westwood Village Memorial Park 
  in California, with interment at Amity Cemetery, Amity, Ohio. Lynde was survived 
  by his sisters Grace and Helen, and his brothers Richard and Cordy.</p>
