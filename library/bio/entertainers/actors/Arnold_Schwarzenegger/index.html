<hr>

<p>Star of "The Terminator," and "True Lies," among far too many others. <p>
Would be future <a href="/library/bio/presidents/">president of the United States</a> had he not been born in Austria.<p>
One of several actors who believe in Republicanism because they pay high taxes on income from their many movies featuring lots of guns, including <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/charlton-heston/">Charlton Heston</a>, Bruce Willis and Clint Eastwood.<p>
Because actors make great politicians (like <a href="/library/bio/presidents/ronald-reagan/">Ronald Reagan</a>), Arnold and his friends are given a pass by their fellow social conservatives for their transgressions vis a vis sex and violence in movies and television. </p>
