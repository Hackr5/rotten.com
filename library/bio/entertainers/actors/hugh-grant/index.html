British movie star who received a blowjob in a parked automobile from hooker <a href="/library/bio/misc/divine-brown/">Divine Brown</a> in exchange for $45. The LAPD swooped in on the pair during the course of the oral copulation and arrested them both. He was ultimately fined $1,180 and placed on probation for two years.
<p>

But the criminal penalties were of practically no consequence. Of utmost concern was handling the unsavory press that could cripple his new film, <i>Nine Months</i>. Unlike most celebrities facing similar scandals, Grant was forced to take the time-untested path of high-profile public apologies.

He started his quest on <i>The Tonight Show</i>. His appearance drew in a huge audience -- in fact, the episode's ratings completely blew away <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/comic/david-letterman/">Letterman</a>, after which point Leno consistently beat Dave.
<p>

And he made lots more appearances. As he explained to <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/radio/larry-king/">Larry King</a>'s audience:
<p>

<blockquote>
"I could accept some of the things that people have explained, 'stress,' 'pressure,' 'loneliness' -- that that was the reason. But that would be false. In the end you have to come clean and say, 'I did something dishonorable, shabby and goatish.'"
</blockquote>
