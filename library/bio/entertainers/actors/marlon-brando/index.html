<h1>Marlon Brando</h1>

As an actor, Brando was once considered a genius, but he died a creepy obese man who seemed more than a little crazy. Evidently one of his best friends was <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/music/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a>. Need we say more? There's also his infamous April 1996 appearance on <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/radio/larry-king/">Larry King</a>'s cable interview show, when Brando went off on an insensitive (and many assumed <a href="/library/history/racism/anti-semitism/">antisemitic</a>) tangent about the people who control Tinseltown:
<p>

<table>
<tr>

<td valign=top>
<blockquote>
<tt>BRANDO:</tt> <i>"Hollywood is run by Jews; it is owned by Jews, and they
should have a greater sensitivity about the issue of --
of people who are suffering. Because they've exploited --
we have seen the -- we have seen the Nigger and
Greaseball, we've seen the Chink, we've seen the
slit-eyed dangerous Jap, we have seen the wily Filipino,
we've seen everything but we never saw the Kike. Because
they knew perfectly well, that that is where you draw the
wagons around."</i>
<p>

<tt>KING:</tt> When you say -- when you say something like that you are playing right in, though, to anti-Semitic people who say the Jews are --
<p>

<tt>BRANDO:</tt> <i>No, no, because I will be the first one who will appraise the Jews honestly and say "Thank God for the Jews."</i>
</blockquote>

Don't forget his eleven children. His son Christian shot and killed the lover of his sister Cheyenne. Christian went to jail, and Cheyenne committed <a href="/library/death/suicide/famous/">suicide</a>.
<p>

Things seem to have changed for Brando after he took the role of Jor-El in the 1978 blockbuster <i>Superman: The Movie</i>. For portraying a character having less than ten minutes of screen time, he received $3.7 million on top of 11.3% of the gross receipts. During his 13 days of filming, Brando read all his lines from cue cards.
<p>

Owns the entire atoll of <i>Tetiaroa</i>, in Polynesia. Part of it is now a resort operated by ex-wife Tarita. He doesn't actually own the island, but he does hold a 99 year lease.

I wanted you to realize that in that minute there were hundreds if not thousands of children hacked to death with a machete, beaten to death by their parents, got typhus and died of a disease." Brando examines his watch for a bit. "Hundreds of children have been hacked to death in the minute I've looked at my watch. Hundreds more were beaten. Don't chat! Think about what I'm saying. It could be you." Then the booing commences with great fervor.
