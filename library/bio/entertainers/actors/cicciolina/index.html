Women's suffrage had a particularly difficult fight in <a href="/library/history/countries/italy/">Italy</a>. It wasn't until 1925 that women gained the right to vote, and even then it was only limited. And when <a href="/library/bio/dictators/mussolini/">Mussolini</a> took power, he rescinded even that meager concession. Full and total participation for women in the Italian political process simply never existed before the end of <a href="/library/history/war/wwii/">World War II</a>.
<p>

There's no telling how many of those women who first tasted political equality in 1945 went on to elect one of their gender in 1987. She wasn't the first female member of the Italian Parliament, but she was doubtless the most famous internationally.
<p>

The name of that Radical Party candidate was Ilona Staller, but she ran under her stage name "Cicciolina." Staller was a Hungarian-born adult film actress who made absolutely no excuses for her career choice. In fact, her public notoriety as a pornstar is what drew people to her campaign rallies. That, plus the fact that her speeches always included a glimpse of her left titty, and sometimes even a complete striptease.

After winning a seat in Parliament, Cicciolina continued acting in hardcore videos for another two years. During the shooting of <i>Rise of the Roman Empress</i>, she had unprotected sex with porn legend <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/john-holmes/">John Holmes</a> without knowing that he was HIV positive.
<p>

She proposed on two separate occasions to sleep with <a href="/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam Hussein</a> if he would just agree to knock it off already. She made the original appeal in September 1990 during the Gulf War buildup. Cicciolina announced to the world: "<i>I am available to make love with Saddam Hussein to achieve peace in the Middle East.</i>"
<p>

She renewed the offer in October 2002.

Formerly married to postmodern lameass and professional poseur Jeff Koons.

Later ran for a seat in the Hungarian parliament, but lost.

<blockquote><i>
"My breasts have never done anyone any harm, while <a href="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/osama-bin-laden/">bin Laden</a>'s war has caused thousands of victims."</i>
-- October 2002
<p>

<i>"I am here not showing my breasts. Now I am speaking about poor people so it is not necessary -- not because I don't have beautiful breasts ... even now. But it's not necessary showing because poor people have no interest in my breasts."
</i>
-- 2002
