<h1>John Holmes</h1>

<img src="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/john-holmes/john_holmes_wadd_shrunk.jpg" height="301" width="200" hspace="15" align=left>

The most precise measurement ever given for the length of John Holmes' penis was 12.58 inches, cited in SCREW magazine. But 20.51% of that figure was pure hype.
<p>

In a 1989 <i>Rolling Stone</i> article, ex-wife Sharon recalled John's self-amazement when he measured his penis in 1968: "<i>It goes from five inches all the way to ten. Ten inches long! Four inches around!</i>" That night, to Sharon's dismay, he revealed his intention to become a porn actor.
<p>

He became the all-time world's greatest. During his career, Holmes starred in 3,000 films and fucked hundreds of porn actresses, including Seka, <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/linda-lovelace/">Linda Lovelace</a>, <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/marilyn-chambers/">Marilyn Chambers</a>, and <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/cicciolina/">Cicciolina</a>.
<p>

He got hooked on drugs, primarily cocaine, which eventually rendered him incapable of performing. He was always late to the set, and when he finally did show up he'd disappear into the bathroom for hours at a time. After which point, of course, he was scatterbrained and unable to maintain an erection. Then he stopped getting roles.
<p>

During the height of his drug addiction, Holmes went broke and turned to crime to support his habit. He stole luggage from the baggage claim at LAX, sold things he purchased with his wife's charge cards, broke into cars. Somewhere around this time, John got involved with alleged drug dealer Eddie Nash, who had an unsavory reputation. According to John's wife Laura: "He was an awful man... John told me he used to leave the bathrooms without toilet paper, then offer the young women cocaine if they'd lick his ass clean."
<p>

In June 1981, four of John's acquaintances raided 8763 Wonderland Avenue, Eddie Nash's house. They forced Nash at gunpoint to open a floor safe, which yielded more than $100,000 in cash, $150,000 in jewelry, eight pounds of cocaine, a kilo of heroin, and 5,000 quaaludes. Nobody died that night.
<p>

When the gang returned to their Laurel Canyon hideout, Holmes was waiting for them. He freebased some of the coke and then they cut him in. He received a paltry $3,000 for having unlocked Nash's back door the night before. A few days later, Nash somehow caught up with Holmes and persuaded him to confess. Then they all went to Laurel Canyon and brutally murdered everyone in the hideout.
<p>

John was tried in 1982 for his involvement in the Wonderland slayings. Holmes was defended by attorney Earl Hanson, who later represented serial killer <a href="/library/bio/crime/serial-killers/william-g-bonin/">William G Bonin</a>.
<p>

Died of <a href="/library/medicine/epidemics/aids/">AIDS</a> in March 1988. Diagnosed HIV-positive in 1986, but continued to make films without informing any of his partners of his status.
<p>

Claimed 14,000 fucks, though the actual number is probably in the low thousands. Starred in 2,000 porno films.
