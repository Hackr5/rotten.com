<td valign=top><font size=-1>In Britain, pop singer George Michael complains to ITV1's <i>Tonight With Trevor McDonald</i> that he cannot safely return to the United States after a critical story in the <i>New York Post</i>: "It's been very heavily inferred that I was actually an <a href="/library/history/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda/">al Qaeda</a> sympathiser, that somehow I thought that there was something not horrific and shocking about the attacks on September 11. I was trying to do some damage control because my life was in danger. Americans are very reactionary right now and I -- because of that article -- cannot return to America, even though my partner lives there."</font></td>
