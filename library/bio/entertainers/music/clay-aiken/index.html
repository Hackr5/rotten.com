<h1>Clay Aiken</h1>

<p><img src="photo-h-4.jpg" width="367" height="238" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">It 
  was really down to the wire for Spaghetti and the Meatball. Onstage, <b>Clay 
  Aiken</b> and Ruben Studdard stood nervously side by side in a battle of the 
  sexes: the two remaining vocalists on Fox's <i>American Idol II.</i></p>
And what a fantastical competition it had been! All season long, audiences were 
subjected to all manner of disjointed sounds, strangled groans, high-sonic stilettos 
and trivial screeches with little or no actual weight. Flat, inflectionless dry-heaves, 
car alarms and repetitive dog barks warped by whiskey competed against squawky, 
would-be divas smothering even the <i>simplest</i> of lyrics with overarching 
vocal gymnastics in a desperate attempt to curry the favor of skeptical judges. 
People who watched the show at full volume regularly ran the risk of blindness 
and severe hearing impairment, and one by one only the "lesser" candidates 
were summarily dispatched without further opportunity to clear their clotted throats 
of rumbling phlegm. That is, if you suspended your disbelief long enough to pretend 
there was ever an actual gradation among the dwindling talent pool. 
<p><img src="photo-v-4.jpg" width="238" height="367" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Journalists 
  and fans had been fawning over Aiken's likeable awkwardness and <i>aw-shucks-gee-whiz</i> 
  candor for weeks. Entertainment reporters gushed about Aiken's lily-white appearance, 
  his breezy approachability, and his modestly charming (yet humorously self-effacing) 
  personality in such glowing terms that he seemed the <b>only</b> logical choice 
  for a pop music franchise.</p>
<p>Also in his favor was a spontaneous mid-season <b>makeover:</b> a cliched transformation 
  from "geek to chic," performed with the laser precision of a battery 
  of metrosexual stylists. His dirty brown tips were frosted bronzy-reddish-blonde 
  and given a sharp, gelatinous spike. They took away his faggy collared shirts 
  and replaced them with cotton crew necks and a pearly white Don Johnson blazer. 
  Two colored contact lenses later, he was good to go.</p>
<p><img src="rphoto-v-3.jpg" width="238" height="367" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">His 
  opponent, Ruben "Sumo of Soul" Studdard, was a 350-pound African-American 
  from Alabama. His health and well-being were constantly called into question, 
  and the "fat factor" became an increasing priority with recording 
  executive Clive Davis. "He sometimes can be terribly lethargic," one 
  insider remarked. "He moves slow." Clive knew the dangers Ruben faced 
  if he didn't get his weight in order. Throughout nearly every performance, Ruben 
  mopped the flop sweat from his streaked cheeks and let loose with flying spit 
  during a particularly wheezy rendition of <i>Baby I Need Your Lovin'.</i> Talk 
  about your American Idle. You could put a red shirt on this guy and holler <b>HEY, 
  KOOL-AID.</b> Let's get the inside scoop on Ruben from the scintillating interview 
  available on his Web site.</p>
<p> <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>Q: Do you have a job?</b><br>
  A: No.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q: What was your most embarrassing moment?</b><br>
  A: None.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q: What would people be surprised to learn about you?</b><br>
  A: Nothing.</font></p>
<p>Needless to say, when Ruben <b>actually won the show,</b> whitey-white folks 
  from coast to coast just plain <b>froze</b> in disbelief, aghast and agog with 
  palpable racism. <i>B-but Clay's so skinny! He's fresh-faced and cute! He belts 
  them out like a poor man's Rick Astley!</i> Little girls sobbed. Clay's own 
  family screamed and cringed. Meanwhile, black folks reacted like they did to 
  the Simpson verdict: cheering, hugging one another, jumping up and down and 
  crying because they were <b>just so happy.</b> Fans flooded the FCC with clamoring 
  cries to investigate. So what <img src="image_20904.jpg" width="225" height="330" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">happened? 
  What caused this tremendous upset? Jury rigging? <b>Phone-vote tampering?</b><br>
  <br>
  Not exactly. Ruben plugged directly into that time-honored hybrid: his look 
  and feel invoked traditional, huggable thug-life daydreams often contemplated 
  by sanitized, suburban wiggers. His sound was clearly inspired by the soulful, 
  <i>I-promise-to-never-hit-you-again-baby </i>strains of MoTown.<br>
  <br>
  Plus he's <b>obese, for Christ's sake.</b> If that doesn't get win a sympathy 
  vote from the <i>one-in-three overweight Americans</i> parked in front of their 
  plasma screens, what will? Fat's where it's at, ladies and germs. Thin's a sin. 
  As long as a linebacker like Ruben remained an economically viable option, there 
  was <b>no way in hell</b> Americans would ever select a mincing, prancing little 
  nelly like Clay Aiken to be their idol.</p>
<p> Clay poked through the hole of glory on the ever popular <b>asexual leprechaun</b> 
  ticket. He's a <i>My Pretty Pony </i>whose devout southern Baptist beliefs masquerade 
  as mainstream pop music, and his album <i>Measure of a Man</i> suggests little 
  more than a thumb and forefinger held two inches apart. People are too busy 
  marveling at the wonders of a pint-sized pretty boy with an impossibly resonant 
  singing voice to remember that Jim Neighbors (aka <b>Gomer Pyle</b>) falls well 
  within the same category. Whenever either one opens his mouth to sing, stand 
  back -- he's probably after your lucky charms.</p>
<p>Aiken has tapped into an audience by and large ignored by the music industry: 
  middle class, Pilates-loving Christian moms who can't handle references to sex, 
  drugs or explicit content. On the cover of <i>Rolling Stone</i>, Aiken wore 
  his trademarked, impish smirk and a <i>What Would Jesus Do</i> bracelet. <i>Time</i> 
  magazine reports of Clay's ongoing struggle with RCA to keep his videos and 
  music squeaky clean.</p>
<p> <img src="peta.jpg" width="300" height="482" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">But 
  such a lad isn't completely impervious to scandal. <a href="/library/culture/peta/">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a> (PETA) wants Aiken to <b>apologize</b> for disparaging remarks he 
  made about<i> kitty cats </i>during an interview with Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>"I think cats are Satan," Aiken said. "There's nothing worse 
  to me than a house cat. When I was about sixteen, I had a kitten and ran over 
  it. Seeing that cat die, I actually think that its spirit has haunted me. I 
  wasn't afraid of cats before. But now they scare me to death." <br>
  <br>
  PETA deals with dozens of cases of cruelty to cats every week, and claims to 
  know firsthand how damaging statements like Aiken's can be to impressionable 
  kids eager to mimic what their idols do. The organization promptly mounted a 
  neuter-your-pets campaign, in which Triumph the Insult Comic Dog references 
  a castrated, eunuched Clay Aiken. </p>
<p> If Aiken posts a message on his Web site urging pet owners to spay or neuter 
  their animals, <b>and</b> he grants PETA an exclusive interview, the campaign 
  tagline will be substituted with <i>Cut 'em off. They don't taste that great 
  anyway.</i><br>
  <br>
  Aiken's attorney Roger Widynowski, refused to comment. A representative from 
  the Virginia-based Dog Balls Coalition (DBC) declined to offer a statement, 
  but in response to the "outrageous" ad campaign directed at Clay Aiken, 
  a bean bag manufacturer in Annandale, Virginia has staged a protest by taking 
  down a web page featuring photos of dogs in overstuffed bean bag chairs.</p>
