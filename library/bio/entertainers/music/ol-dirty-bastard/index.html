Ol' Dirty Bastard was easily the most tempermental, unpredictable member of rap super group Wu-Tang Clan. ODB helped form the group in 1992, but his off-stage antics have since overshadowed his on-stage talent. In 1998, he tried to change his name to "Big Baby Jesus", got shot in the back in his own home and was arrested several times. He allegedly stole a pair of sneakers, threatened to kill his ex-girlfriend, threatened a security guard and finally ended up in a drug treatment facility in <a href="/library/travel/cities/los-angeles/">Los Angeles</a>. Somehow he escaped and remained on the run from the law, even making appearances on stage from time to time, before finally being apprehended at a fast food restraurant in Philadelphia. In 2001 he was sentenced to 2-4 years in prison.

He is then escorted offstage.  He later discussed his actions backstage with Chris Connelly of MTV News:
