<h1>Gallagher</h1>
<table width="750" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td><p><i><img src="nudemelon.jpg" width="300" height="346" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">"I'm 
        tired of being dismissed as merely a guy who smashes fruit."</i></p>
      <p>California might be one big party town, but in August of 2003, Governor 
        Gray Davis was considered the club's worst dj. When the recall circus 
        began, anyone capable of coughing up the $3500 filing fee and 65 signatures 
        could get their names affixed to the ballot.</p>
      <p>Never mind that <i>sixty-five</i> was roughly the same number collected 
        by fans of NBC's 1983 series <i>Manimal</i> to get the program back on 
        the air - but for veteran prop comic <b>Gallagher,</b> securing signatures 
        in Los Angeles was like pulling teeth. He "stood on Sunset Boulevard 
        like a prostitute," soliciting a city full of multinationals who 
        didn't recognize him. And the rest just didn't seem that interested in 
        getting registered to vote. When he showed up in the lobby of The Washington 
        Post with a large cardboard box filled with dirty clothes, a security 
        guard asked him to leave.</p>
      <p>Known for his balding head with Krusty the Klown tufts, horizontally 
        striped shirts and foppish berets, this precursor to Carrot Top sledgehammered 
        his way to fame and fortune in the early 1980s. During his comedy routine, 
        he was indeed the first to postulate openly, <i>if 7-11 convenience stores 
        are open 24 hours, why do they have locks on the doors?</i> Less than 
        a decade later, comic Steven Wright would answer his query: "sure 
        they're open 24 hours - but not in a row." Gallagher's comedy involves 
        wordplay, insightful satire, and the spectacular, splattery destruction 
        of maleable foodstuffs across entire auditoriums. Like <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/magicians/doug-henning/">Doug Henning</a> combined 
        with Weird Al Yankovic and sprinkled with Cheech and Chong, Gallagher 
        inspired a generation. During a segment of the Wachowski Brother's <i><a href="/library/culture/the-matrix/">The Matrix</a></i> - as Neo is running through an outdoor market - the directors 
        insisted watermelons get a little smashed up as an homage to the comic.</p>
      <p><img src="smashy.jpg" width="432" height="289" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Today, 
        the fifty-seven year old Gallagher's presence cements California as the 
        political loony bin of the entire nation. He'll appear on the upcoming 
        recall ballot as "Leo" Gallagher (his name and astrological 
        sign). He promises to reduce bumper-to-bumper freeway traffic by sending 
        military-style helicopters to airlift wrecked cars. "How is our economy 
        going to move if you can't move on the freeways?"</p>
      <p>Other platforms include the restriction of cellular telephone usage: 
        "it's annoying and the idiots are getting worse. Make it illegal 
        to talk loudly on cell phones in public." He also likes the ideas 
        of newspapers running obituaries for businesses - and suggests that if 
        the state of California operates at a loss, then its citizens should write 
        off their share of the loss on their federal income tax returns. Nnnnot 
        bad, actually.</p>
      <p><img src="drink.jpg" width="264" height="279" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><img src="skirt.jpg" width="222" height="282" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Not 
        one to "skirt" issues [left], his campaign slogans run the gamut 
        from "Finally, a governor you can get drunk with," [right] and 
        "Together we can screw the state," to "A grass roots movement 
        you can't stop from rolling."</p>
      <p>Gallagher postponed his September 6th concert at the Topeka, Kansas Performing 
        Arts center to focus on his campaign. He's now entitled under equal access 
        law to television appearances with Jay Leno, Diane Sawyer, and Matt Lauer. 
        When he attempted to make a surprise announcement on CNN's <i>CrossFire,</i> 
        he was pre-empted by a massive, northeastern electrical blackout which 
        struck down power in Ottawa and portions of the United States. Then he 
        announced on WGN Television in <a href="/library/travel/cities/chicago/">Chicago</a> that he's not only running for 
        Governor of California, he's entering the 2004 <b>Presidential Race</b> 
        as well. Following performances in Chicago and Davenport, Gallagher plans 
        to campaign at the Iowa State Fair.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="mont.jpg" width="750" height="200" vspace="0"></p>
      <p><img src="melon.jpg" width="200" height="285" align="left">But 
        on August 15th, 2003, journalists at Rotten Dot Com uncovered a scandal 
        - and evidence which reasonably sensitive black voters might not take 
        a liking to. On Gallagher's web site, there exists a tell-tale link to 
        a small business called <i>Wally Amos Watermelon Hats</i>, trademarked, 
        owned by, and used under license by Soma, a limited liability corporation. 
        Wally Amos, the black proprietor, claims that watermelons are a metaphor 
        for life, and each "Wallymellon" hat contains inspirational 
        seeds of religious wisdom in a hidden compartment. The textured velvet 
        fedora (or top hat), has a cool cotton lining and is fully adjustable 
        to any size. Amos himself was a theatrical agent at the William Morris 
        agency, where he worked with Simon and Garfunkel and The Supremes. Over 
        the years, Amos has acted in network sitcoms and news programs.</p>
      <p><img src="boom.jpg" width="262" height="189" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Supporters 
        might argue that Gallagher's fondness for politically incorrect haberdashery 
        isn't <i>really</i> directed at black people, he's just "taking back 
        the night" by poking fun at watermelons themselves. Supporters insist 
        he's just smashing stereotypes. But by ridiculing melons (or any seeded 
        fruit currently protected under California's multicultural umbrella), 
        by publicly <b>executing</b> literally truckloads of vegetables likely 
        handpicked by impoverished Mexican immigrants - what kind of message could 
        Gallagher possibly be sending to the Latino community? Do Hispanic Americans 
        in the front row really want this comic's threadbare political agenda 
        splashed across their faces?</p>
      <p>Gallagher responds: because the state is 50% Latino, as governor he would 
        mandate the singing of a Spanish version of the <i>Star Spangled Banner</i> 
        at 50% of all statewide sporting events. He'd also build an enormous dam 
        across the Gulf of California to create a fertile valley in Mexico. When 
        the seawater is sufficiently drained, crops will be grown and harvested 
        by Mexican families who wouldn't have to immigrate to the states.</p>
      <p><img src="treasure1.jpg" width="288" height="403" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Other 
        proposed initiatives include:</p>
      <p>- Expanding the indecent exposure statute to place restrictions on teenage 
        boys' ability to sport low-hanging pants (so the "pooper part" 
        is less visible). However, Governor Gallagher would make it legal for 
        kids to "cruise" and show off their lowriders, abolishing anti-cruising 
        laws and establishing lawful zones where kids could cruise safely.</p>
      <p>- Allowing motorcycles to use the diamond lane (but not go between cars) 
        because frankly that scares him.</p>
      <p>- To save taxpayer money, all remaining <a href="/library/bio/crime/serial-killers/charles-manson/">Charles Manson</a> parole board 
        hearings would be cancelled.</p>
      <p>And there are key science and technology issues in his agenda as well: 
        Because the U.S. won <a href="/library/history/war/wwii/">World War II</a> and world leadership by way of sub-atomic 
        particles in atomic weaponry, Gallagher proposes that sub-atomic particles 
        be characters in video games, card games and cartoons, "so a future 
        electorate will be more informed than the one who cancelled the supercollider."</p>
      <p>Presently, much of California's fertile Central Valley frowns upon his 
        reckless, feckless wastage of precious foodstuffs - alleging he's only 
        using the state to revive his B-list career. Flagrant destruction of the 
        state's number-one cash crops place him in a tense position with members 
        of California's Green Party. And watermelons aren't the only products 
        which fall victim to his trademarked Sledge-O-Matic: Gallagher concerts 
        also consume and destroy cantaloupes, pineapples, bowls of oatmeal - even 
        oversize bottles of pink dishwashing detergent. </p>
      <p>"You gotta get a comic to clean this place out," he says - 
        a statement equally true of Gallagher concert halls and California politics. 
        Voters will tentatively emerge from behind their clear, plastic ponchos 
        for statewide special election on Tuesday, October 7th, 2003. Polls will 
        be open from 7:00am to 8:00pm.</p>
