"I have a few rules when I'm up here... Also, faggots aren't allowed to look at my ass while I'm onstage. That's why I keep moving when I'm up here. You don't know where the faggot section is, so I keep moving."

<blockquote><font size=-1>
"He put two $100 bills on my leg and said, <i>'Here's $200.'</i> He asked me if I did this for a living, being a transsexual prostitute. I said yes. Eddie said, <i>'Do you like to wear lingerie?'</i> I said yes. He said, <i>'Can I see you in lingerie?'</i> I told him, 'Whenever I have the time.' He said, <i>'I'll make the time.'</i> Then he asked me, <i>'What type of sex do you like?'</i> I said I was into everything."
</font></blockquote>
<p>

First off: Eddie Murphy <a href="/library/sex/heterosexuality/famous/">is not queer</a>. Absolutely not. If anything, Eddie considers gays to be simply objects of lighthearted derision. Remember that hilarious comedy routine from <i>Raw</i> where he wonders what the <i>Honeymooners</i> would have been like if Ralph and Ed were gay lovers?
<p>

<blockquote><font size=-1><i>
"Norton, my friend. How would <b>you</b>... like to fuck <b>me</b>... up the ass? I know you wanna fuck me Norton. And you know that I know that you know that you wanna fuck me. So I'm gonna bend over. And when I do, I'm counting to five. And when I'm done, start fucking!"
</i></font></blockquote>
<p>

If Eddie were himself gay, then <i>why on Earth would he raise the issue?</i> It just doesn't make any sense. Use your head.

One San Diego native, Summer St. Cerely (aka Alfie) has already sold her story to <i>The Globe</i> and appeared on many talk shows. Another local San Diego queen who still lives here and had an affair with Murphy is the ever-sexy and beautiful blonde bombshell Evelyn Thomas (Queen of Queens III and a former Miss Gay San Diego titleholder), who told me that she remembers that Murphy's "private part" curved like a banana! Another gorgeous drag queen, Mercedes Alexander... has also been splattered all over the press for her affair with Murphy... What makes this so outrageous and Eddie Murphy such a hypocritical asshole has been his years of anti-gay jokes and vicious attacks on our community earlier in his career. Yes, Eddie, every dog has its day and you deserve all that you're getting."</font></td></tr>
