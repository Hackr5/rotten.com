<h1>Paula Poundstone</h1>

Paula Poundstone was born on December 29th, 1959, in Birmingham, Alabama... but you don't care about that. You don't even care that she was a foster child and got her feature film debut (and really, only feature film) in the 1984 flick <i>Hyperspace</i>. Her squeaky-clean comedy act, her many appearances on <i>The Tonight Show</i>, her own short-lived <i>Paula Poundstone Show</i> in 1993... even her recurring roles on various sitcoms elicit nothing more than a derisive "meh."
<p>

No, all you care about is that in June of 2001, she was arrested for various charges representing endangerment of foster and adopted children under her care.
<p>

And you don't even care about <I>that</i>; you really just care that somehow, this gravelly-voiced commedienne with years of on-the-fringes appearances and an act of being incredulous and softly snide about politics and life, was charged with <i>committing lewd acts on a girl under the age of 14</i>.

 But let's cover with the child endangerment charge first. Poundstone, besides acquiring a couple foster children and adopting three of her own, had also acquired a serious drinking problem. One day she decided to go get her kids some ice cream, and took them along, not noting her own blood-alcohol level. Whoops! Witnesses at the ice cream parlor were taken in enough by her demeanor and behavior to call in a complaint with the police. Hence, the "endangerment" problem. 
<p>

Poundstone, to her credit, immediately took responsibility for the situation, checking herself into rehab even before the case went to court. Her lawyer later claimed that negotiations had begun to settle or work out the cases of endangerment and lewd acts, but the police went ahead and arrested her anyway, putting her before the court (and the world) on June 27, 2001. She was freed on $200,000 bail, and after giving a one-line sentence outside the court about the truth coming out, went into seclusion (and back into Promises, the Malibu rehab clinic she had checked into.) 

<p>
After six months at Promises, a dozen psychiatric evaluations, and an agreement to go to ongoing counselling and AA meetings, she was given supervised meetings of her adopted children, and full custody of them a year later. The lewd acts charge, that eyebrow-raising shock out of her otherwise minor case, was nowhere to be found, as it was dropped by the prosecution before her plea agreement.<p>

The foster children are gone (and her settlement disallows her from having any more) but the charge against her for lewd acts stems from one of the two she had under her custody. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to find out what exactly the accusations were.
<p>

No less a reputable news organization as the <i>National Enquirer</i> weighed in with their own "exclusive", that the charges were spurious complaints by Poundstone's foster daughter to get back at her mom for the usual crimes of disallowing her from going out. This speculation (which it is at best) would explain the gag order issued by the judge to all principals in the case during Poundstone's plea agreement; no sense in scarring the child just for telling a fib that ruins her guardian's reputation and means of support.  
<p>

But this same prohibition means that Poundstone must continue to work under a cloud, unable to tell the "real story" about her arrest and conviction, and leaving her to pick up the pieces of her career, including appearances on the NPR radio show "Wait, Wait, don't tell me" and the occasional club date. Certainly, an inauspicious final act to a ... career.

The E! True Hollywood Story: Paula Poundstone, debuts.

She had a thriving career, too. But that would all change when a trip for some ice cream with her kids turned her world upside down."
