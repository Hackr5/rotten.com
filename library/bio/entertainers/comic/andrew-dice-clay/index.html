        My balls fell out of my jock.<br>
        I laid them to rest <br>
        On some hooker's chest <br>
        And paddled her face with my cock.</font></p>

              The cat and the fiddle,<br>

              That's more than my lazy wife does,<br>

              Little Miss Muffet<br>
              Sat on a tuffet<br>
              A lightbulb was stuck up her ass.<br>
              It woke up the spider<br>
              Who lived deep inside her.<br>
              He said "Hey, free electric and gas."<br>
              <br>
              Jack and Jill went up the hill<br>
              And Jack would try to hump her.<br>
              Jill said No / and Jack said So<br>
              I'll ram it in your dumper.<br>

              I bought her dinner, she had fun.<br>

            <p><font size="-1"> Old Mother Hubbard<br>
              Went to the cupboard <br>
              To get her old dog a snack.<br>
              The cupboard was bare, <br>
              She didn't despair. <br>
              She let Rover munch on her crack <br>

              Whacked off in the movie theater.<br>
              Sprayed his load across the screen <br>

              Jack and Betty, up in a tree<br>
              F-U-C-K-I-N-G<br>

              Then comes the goo from Betty's crack.<br>

              Little Boy Blue -<br>
              He needed the money.</font></p>

              Jerked off in his girlfriend's eye<br>
              When her eye was dry and shut <br>
              Georgie fucked that one-eyed slut<br>
              <br>
              Old King Cole was a merry old soul<br>
              A merry old soul was he<br>
              He chewed off his tit<br>
              And ate his own shit<br>
              And washed it down with some tea.<br>

              Hickory Dickory Dock<br>
              Some chick was sucking my cock<br>
              The clock struck two<br>
              I dropped my goo<br>
              I dumped the bitch on the next block.<br>
              <br>
              Jack and Jill went up the hill<br>
              Both with a buck and a quarter<br>
              Jill came down with two-fifty<br>
              That fuckin' whore.<br>
              <br>
              Mary, Mary, quite contrary, <br>
              Trim that pussy it's too damn hairy<br>

              Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet <br>
              Eating her curds and whey.<br>
              Along came a spider,<br>
              Who sat down beside her<br>
              And said, "Hey, what's in the bowl, bitch?"<br>
              <br>
              Old Mother Hubbard<br>
              Went to the cupboard<br>
              To get her poor dog a bone<br>
              When she bent over,<br>
              Her Rover took over<br>
              And she got a bone of her own.</font></p>

              <br>

              Fucked her ass and went to bed<br>

              Eating a pizza pie.<br>
              He shit pepperoni,<br>
              Then blew his friend Tony,<br>

<td valign="top"><p><img src="98030926.jpg" width="242" height="364" hspace="10" align="right"><strong>"Watching Jerry Seinfeld on stage is like watching a fucking accountant,"</strong> says comedian Andrew Dice Clay. "It's just so absolutely god-awful. I would rather watch a Monday night amateur who doesn't know any better try to create something funny rather than going, <i>'Have you been to <a href="/library/crime/corporate/mcdonalds/">McDonald's</a> lately?'</i> Yeah, I have. What's so funny about it? The fries are good. You put <em>me</em> on stage, I'm the greatest stand-up ever in the history of American culture."</p>
            <p>For a short while, that statement may not have been far from the 
              truth, considering any controversy surrounding Clay's plain, straightforward 
              blue humor predated the <a href="/library/culture/south-park/">South Park</a> franchise by well over a 
              decade. Single evening engagements with Dice packed tens of thousands 
              of screaming fans into auditoriums all across America, and filled 
              Madison Square Gardens to capacity on more than one occasion.</p>
            <p><strong>Andrew Clay Silverstein</strong> started practicing comedy 
              at age twenty. He didn't know anyone in the business, but he worked 
              hard every night to sharpen what can only be described as an <em>impossibly</em> 
              crass, racist, misogynist attache of gags under the guise of his 
              stage presence, a character affectionately referred to as <b>Diceman.</b> 
              While other comedians were out postulating whether or not you might 
              be redneck, Diceman had already begun dumbing it down a notch.</p>
            <p><img src="5wivespre3.jpg" width="259" height="400" hspace="10" align="left">"All over the country, stop cigarettes, stop fuckin' cigarettes. Up in San Francisco, the fag capitol of California, they passed a bill, you can't even smoke in the street. They say it <em>offends</em> people. But it's okay if you wanna butt-slam your buddy while waiting for the bus? You smack him in the face with your dick five or six times? Oh, this isn't offensive. You can smoke a baloney pony, but not a fuckin' Marlboro? Wiping your ass is a filthy habit but nobody's banning that. <em>Oh look at him - he's smoking!</em> Yeah, and I'm jerking off too, honey. Come a little closer, I'll butter your fuckin' popcorn."</p>
            <p>Women sitting front row center were regularly traumatized by Dice's 
              immediate attention. "Look at this big-titty bitch," he'd 
              begin. "Her tits are huge. I would <strong>not</strong> mind 
              sticking my dick in between those. Would you mind if I checked them 
              out right here? How much do they weigh?"</p>
            <p>One female audience member, Heather Swanson, was mortified. "For ten minutes he went on about my chest. He even brought my roommate into it, fantasizing what would it be like to have both 'pairs' in his face. When it was over, if there were a garbage bag I would have worn it home. I have never seen so many people, men and women, stare at breasts like they did. No eye contact is all I could think. Just don't look up. Don't even breathe."</p>
            <p><img src="387954-resized200.JPG" width="200" height="200" align="right">Dice 
              is accused of trafficking only in the <a href="/library/language/insult/">Insult</a>, obvious stereotypes, 
              and age-old generalizations. Elder comedians like <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/comic/don-rickles/">Don Rickles</a> 
              and <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/comic/richard-pryor/">Richard Pryor</a> have indeed paved the way for this kind of material, 
              but people regard Clay with contempt, like he's doing more harm 
              than good onstage. He entertains mindless drunken adults with excruciating 
              humor about Asian drivers. "How do you drive when your eyes 
              are three-quarters of the way shut?" he rants on an album, 
              even going so far as to include the shopworn bit about blinding 
              them with dental floss. "You don't give 'em keys to a car, 
              you kick 'em in the ass and say get the fuck out of the country!"</p>
            <p>His leather jacket and booming Brooklyn drawl provide ninety-nine 
              percent of the assault. His appearance on the 1989 MTV Video Awards 
              contained so much profanity that he was banned from the network 
              altogether. The controversy continued the following year when Dice's 
              booking as guest host for <a href="/library/culture/snl/">Saturday Night Live</a> caused cast member 
              Nora Dunn to boycott the show in protest of his remarks about women. 
              Dunn never returned to the cast.</p>
            <p><img src="dice6.jpg" width="288" height="259" hspace="10" align="left">Meanwhile, 
              other comedians didn't understand what was so funny. They analyzed 
              transcripts of his material - and, well, they couldn't find any 
              actual <strong>jokes.</strong> Entertainers on the comedy circuit 
              (George Carlin and Bill Cosby, chief among them) grew concerned. 
              The "Diceman" had effectively dumbed down audience attention 
              spans, conscious engagement, and expectation. Dice was an abstract 
              threat who made it seem like comedy <em>without</em> dick jokes 
              somehow lacked value. His ridiculous nursery rhymes were warping 
              the bell curve. And besides, it hardly seemed fair that brilliant, 
              mind-expanding satirists like Bill Hicks were forced to labor away 
              in relative obscurity while "controversial" Dice graduated 
              to celebrity millionaire status. Andrew Dice Clay was soon soaking 
              up everything Las Vegas had to offer.</p>
            <p>"I've even got a telescope in my room to look into other rooms. What's better than that? What's better than peeping on some guy that's not here with his wife, ya know, pickin' up some slob in the casino, gettin' her all liquored up and they're gonna get sloppy in his room bangin' their brains out? I'm disease free; I take care of myself, and I go to sleep. I clock out before I'm finished. <a href="/library/sex/masturbation/">Masturbation</a> is the best sleeping pill you could ever imagine. You know that. Don't ever lie to me 'cause I know when you are."</p>
            <p>On December 11, 1998, Dice appeared on the now-defunct <em>Politically 
              Incorrect</em> with Bill Maher, alongside Republican Congressman 
              Jack Kingston, former MTV personality Kennedy, and Eric McCormack 
              from <em>Will and Grace</em>. It was four chirpy, polished professionals 
              and a lumpy, abrasive Dice Clay. He looked like a dazed alcoholic, 
              smoking cigarettes from his pocket and dispensing trademarked pearls 
              of wisdom on subjects like the <a href="/library/history/political-scandal/lewinsky-affair/">Lewinsky Affair</a>.</p>
            <p><img src="pi027.jpg" width="302" height="217" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">"They 
              should give <a href="/library/bio/presidents/bill-clinton/">Bill Clinton</a> a raise for banging all these ugly 
              chicks," Dice was heard to remark. "It's not like he's 
              going with the Pamela Andersons of the world. Or Paula Jones - that 
              chick's got a snout like an anteater. Or these big, heavyset lesbians 
              like Linda Tripp. With them jowls hanging down. She's like a walrus 
              outta the zoo. She got mad that Lewinsky was getting all of it, 
              and that's what causes women to go with other women. Don't get me 
              wrong - I don't mind if they're a little <em>thick,</em> but there 
              should be a law against ugliness. There needs to be a three-week 
              incarceration and a $1,000 fine. With all the lipstick and rouge 
              and eye makeup, there should not be ugliness in <img src="pi012.jpg" width="299" height="223" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">this 
              world."</p> 
            <p>As the discussion escalated into gender matters, flat-chested activist 
              Kennedy tried her darnedest to give Dice the smackdown. "Andrew 
              - can I just say - you're so inarticulate you make Dennis Rodman 
              look like Oprah Winfrey."</p>
            <p>This put-down actually fails upon closer examination, because Rodman 
              and Winfrey are equally inarticulate. However, a smattering of obedient 
              barks and seal-slaps rippled through the air-conditioned studio.</p>
            <p>"A lot of people tell me that," Clay responded to Kennedy 
              over the laughter. "But later on when I get you all liquored 
              up and sloppy on the dance floor, all of a sudden I become your 
              hero. Look what I'm doing to you now. Good for me. You wouldn't 
              talk to me if I didn't appeal to you." Kennedy squinched up 
              her face, effectively telegraphing her disgust.</p>
            <p><img src="mvmnewdiceclay2022798.gif" width="307" height="232" hspace="10" align="right"> 
              Dice briefly tried to change his image, with limited success. He 
              shortened his name to Andrew Clay and took the lead role in <i>Bless 
              This House</i>, a squeaky-clean, profanity-free CBS sitcom fashioned 
              after <i>The Honeymooners.</i></p>
            <p>GLAAD took issue with Dice's presence on network television right 
              away, protesting his sexist, homophobic reputation. Peter Noah, 
              an independent producer for Warner Bros. Television emphatically 
              asserted that the <i>Diceman</i> persona was distinctly different 
              from Andrew Clay the <i>actor</i>. It was decided that Clay's character 
              would not talk, dress, or behave in any way like Dice - and surprise, 
              the show lasted less than five months. Clay returned to Las Vegas, 
              where he performs Diceman routines to this day.</p>
            <p>"It's not about the controversy - it's about being funny, 
              and being funny means saying whatever you feel like saying to make 
              people laugh. I'm not saying this to 5-year-olds. I'm saying this 
              to adults. I never incited riots. I did gay material, I still do
