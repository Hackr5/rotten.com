<p>Letterman at Mc Donald's <br>
November 26, 1993 <br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
LETTERMAN: Yes. Welcome to Mc Donald's. What do you want? <br>
CUSTOMER: Hello. <br>
LETTERMAN: Yeah, what can I do for you? <br>
CUSTOMER: Medium Sprite. <br>
LETTERMAN: Let me have that order again, please. <br>
CUSTOMER: Sprite. <br>
LETTERMAN: Medium Sprite? <br>
CUSTOMER: That's it. <br>
LETTERMAN: That's all? <br>
CUSTOMER: Yes. <br>
LETTERMAN: You couldn't have gotten out of your car for a medium Sprite? <br>
********** <br>
CUSTOMER: Give me two no. 3's. <br>
LETTERMAN: Two no. 3's. <br>
CUSTOMER: And that should be it then. <br>
LETTERMAN: You know, instead of two no. 3's, I'm just gonna give you a no. 6. 
Is that all right? <br>
CUSTOMER: That's fine. <br>
LETTERMAN: All right, come on through, and you better have a smile on your face. 
<br>
********** <br>
LETTERMAN: (talking to co-worker) You know, Fatima, what I heard is that Ronald 
Mc Donald is gay. Did you hear that? Have you heard anything like that? <br>
********** <br>
LETTERMAN: Hello. <br>
CUSTOMER: Hi. Can I have two cheeseburgers and a small order of fries. <br>
LETTERMAN: You know, ma'am, we're really busy. Can I ask you to circle the lot 
once or twice so we can kind of collect ourselves here? If you don't mind, it 
would really help us out a lot. We're just up to our necks here. <br>
CUSTOMER: Who is this? <br>
LETTERMAN: None of your business. Just circle the lot and we'll pick you up the 
next time, all right? Circle the lot. <br>
(The car takes off and circles the lot.) <br>
********** <br>
LETTERMAN: What can I do for you? <br>
CUSTOMER: I'll take a cheeseburger and a small Coke, please. <br>
LETTERMAN: This is a car wash. Do you want the wax and a wheel job? <br>
********** <br>
LETTERMAN: Hi. Welcome to Mc Donald's. <br>
CUSTOMER: What's in your Happy Meal? <br>
LETTERMAN: You have to prove to me that you're happy or you're not getting anything. 
A Happy Meal is veal shank, german potato salad and a side of lime jello. <br>
CUSTOMER: I'll have a small fry, a quarter-pounder with cheese. <br>
LETTERMAN: Okay. We're completely out of hamburgers. I'm sorry. Ma'am? We're just 
out of the burgers today. <br>
CUSTOMER: Are you for real? <br>
LETTERMAN: I couldn't get to the market. We ran out around 9:00, and I've just 
been strapped here, so I can't get away. Can you go by and get us some ground 
beef? Hello, Ma'am? <br>
********** <br>
LETTERMAN: Yes. Welcome to Mc Donald's. <br>
CUSTOMER: Get me a cheeseburger. <br>
LETTERMAN: Your order is a cheeseburger? <br>
CUSTOMER: Yep. <br>
LETTERMAN: Are you busy right now? <br>
CUSTOMER: I gotta head to work. Why? <br>
LETTERMAN: Could you swing by the grocery store and get us a bag of onions? <br>
CUSTOMER: A bag of onions? <br>
LETTERMAN: Yeah. We're running low. <br>
********** <br>
LETTERMAN: Hello. <br>
CUSTOMER: Yeah. What is that two cheeseburgers meal? What do you get with that? 
<br>
LETTERMAN: You want two cheeseburger meals? <br>
CUSTOMER: No. <br>
LETTERMAN: What do you get with this? <br>
CUSTOMER: Yes. <br>
LETTERMAN: You get a free pack of cigarettes. <br>
********* <br>
LETTERMAN: The regular kid had to take a day off. <br>
He swallowed a straw. <br>
CUSTOMER: And they got you? <br>
LETTERMAN: Yeah. He swallowed a straw. <br>
********** <br>
LETTERMAN: Hello. <br>
CUSTOMER: Yeah. Get a no. 3. <br>
LETTERMAN: A no. 3? <br>
CUSTOMER: Yeah. <br>
LETTERMAN: What else? <br>
CUSTOMER: Uh, uh -- <br>
LETTERMAN: You sound like you're having trouble making up your mind. Are you all 
right? <br>
CUSTOMER: I'm all right. <br>
LETTERMAN: Is everything all right at home? <br>
CUSTOMER: Yeah. <br>
LETTERMAN: Is everything all right with your family? <br>
CUSTOMER: Yeah. <br>
LETTERMAN: Is everything all right at work? <br>
CUSTOMER: Yeah. It's all right at work. <br>
LETTERMAN: You sound just, you know, like a little depressed or something. How 
old are you, sir? <br>
CUSTOMER: 30. <br>
LETTERMAN: 30. Are you pretty much happy with where you are in life? <br>
CUSTOMER: It's a No. 3, all right? <br>
LETTERMAN: I'm more concerned about you. Do you have anybody you can talk to? 
<br>
CUSTOMER: Is it ready? Is it gonna be ready or what? <br>
LETTERMAN: Yes, the food's ready. Sure, the food will always be ready. Are you 
ready? All right. Good luck to you. Come on in. <br>
CUSTOMER: Thanks. <br>
********** <br>
LETTERMAN: United 16957, 727. This is Kennedy Ground Control. What's the problem? 
Power it on in. <br>
CUSTOMER: I have your onions here. <br>
LETTERMAN: What? <br>
CUSTOMER: The ten-pound bag of onions. <br>
LETTERMAN: You're got the onions? All right. Come on through. We really appreciate 
it. Thanks for helping out. <br>
********* <br>
CUSTOMER: Four Cokes, please. <br>
LETTERMAN: Four Cokes. <br>
CUSTOMER: Excuse me. Three Cokes and a Sprite. <br>
LETTERMAN: I'm sorry. You said four and you're gettin' four. I'm up to my neck 
in orders. You said four and that's what we're gonna do. <br>
********* <br>
LETTERMAN: That deal at CBS went away. No, that thing fell through. That's why 
I'm working here. <br>
********* <br>
CUSTOMER: Can I have two Whoppers, please. <br>
LETTERMAN: We're all out of Whopples. <br>
CUSTOMER: No. Whoppers, Whoppers. <br>
LETTERMAN: We got no Whoppers. You kids quit screwin' around. We got no Whoppers 
here. Don't make me come out there. <br>
********** <br>
CUSTOMER: Give me some ice cream without the cone. Just put it in a cup. <br>
LETTERMAN: You want cheese on that? <br>
CUSTOMER: On what? <br>
LETTERMAN: On the ice cream cone? <br>
CUSTOMER: Do I want cheese on it? No, not quite. <br>
********** <br>
CUSTOMER: One diet coke, medium. <br>
LETTERMAN: One diet coke medium. How about some cole slaw? <br>
CUSTOMER: That's it. <br>
LETTERMAN: Huh? <br>
CUSTOMER: No. <br>
LETTERMAN: How about some macaroni salad? <br>
CUSTOMER: No, thank you. <br>
LETTERMAN: How about some potato salad? How about a swell garden salad? Hello. 
<br>
CUSTOMER: Hello. Thank you. <br>
LETTERMAN: No salad at all? <br>
CUSTOMER: No. <br>
LETTERMAN: Hello. <br>
CUSTOMER: No, no salad. <br>
LETTERMAN: When is the last time you had a salad? <br>
CUSTOMER: I'm in a rush to get back to work. <br>
LETTERMAN: Is it all right if we touch your food before we give it to you? How 
much do you weigh? Hello. <br>
(The car squeals out of Mc Donald's.)
