"I hate reality -- I want to be wholly artificial."

<blockquote>
"All this stuff has been because I can't stand life. But it hasn't changed anything. There are moments when I disconnect totally from reality. Then I can do anything, absolutely anything. I swallow pills. I throw myself out of windows. Dying seems very easy then."
</blockquote>
<p>

After Lolo's death in 2000, her husband told a newspaper: "She wanted to be a star, but she couldn't bear living... She often said she'd kill herself if I wasn't there, and a few times she tried... Enough people have exploited me and Lolo already. If you want me to talk any more you'll have to pay."
<p>

"She was always drinking alcohol and coffee and taking pills. She took so many
stimulants that she often made herself ill. The autopsy blames an overdose of
medicine but I think she had literally worn her body out."
