Mike 
  Lookinland, age nine, would have his dishwater-blonde hair dyed chestnut brown 
  once a week and spend the next six years of his life growing up on television 
  as Robert 'Bobby' Brady in <em>The Brady Bunch. </em>At the recommendation of 
  his parents, Lookinland selected this part over an opportunity to play opposite Bill Bixby in <em>The Courtship of Eddie's Father</em>. Either was a thankless role 
  -- but Lookinland's Bobby Brady career would last him the rest of 
  his life.</p>
<p>   The stock-and-staple "youngest son" in any sweeping 
  narrative is rarely given the attention it deserves, but Bobby Brady was an 
  exception. Mike Lookinland delivered a nuanced performance with a haunting intellect, 
  often radiating subtle melancholy or low self-esteem. His character was sensitive 
  about many things, like his height, or his strength. He always seemed locked 
  in competition with his siblings in a desperate attempt to earn the favor of 
  those around him. He tried to do more pull-ups than his brother. He saved Greg 
  from being locked in a meat freezer. He pushed Peter out of the way before he 
  was knocked unconscious by a falling flowerpot. </p>
<p>   Bobby Brady wanted to be the <em>best</em> pool player, the 
  <em>best</em> hall monitor. He dreamt of race cars and lied to his schoolmates 
  about being friends with Joe Namath. Yet Bobby could also display remarkable 
  affection toward his sister Cindy, the only Brady younger than himself. In one 
  eerily incestuous episode, he acts as Cindy's <em>secret admirer</em> when she 
  feels "left out" of her older sisters' gossipy teenage love lives. 
  Who can imagine the pain of knowing so well one's own character?</p>
<p><img src="lookinmug.jpg" width="343" height="467" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right">   Here 
  was a family dynamic where <strong>six children</strong> shared<em> </em><strong>two 
  bedrooms</strong><em> </em>connected by a <strong>single bathroom<em>.</em></strong> 
  And their dad was an architect, for Christ's sake. But despite these glaring 
  clerical errors, <em>The Brady Bunch</em> is now considered the most popular 
  suburban American family sitcom from a bygone era -- and Mike Lookinland 
  helped make it all happen.</p>
<p>   When the program went off the air in 1974, Lookinland Attended 
  Chadwick School in Palos Verdes Peninsula, California. It was a co-educational 
  college preparatory which surrounded him with snotty teenagers who'd watched 
  <em>all</em> his insecurities play out on television. Once the intrigue of his 
  celebrity status wore off, it was a difficult experience to say the least, and 
  he dropped out.</p>
<p>   Lookinland the adult would be an alcoholic for years, taking 
  smaller roles in TV miniseries like <em>Gambler V: Playing for Keeps</em>, and 
  Stephen King's <em>The Stand</em>, but the Brady stigma would entirely overshadow 
  these efforts. Again and again, he'd return to join the cast of <em>The Bradys, 
  The Brady Kids, A Very Brady Christmas, The Brady Girls Get Married, The Brady 
  Bunch Hour, The Brady Bunch Home Movies,</em> and <em>The Brady Kids on Mysterious 
  Island</em> -- an animated Saturday morning cartoon. Whether or not 
  eight-year-olds noticed it was actually <strong>the</strong> Mike Lookinland 
  performing the voiceover is anyone's guess.</p>
<p>   He was arrested November 9, 1997 near St. George, Utah, after 
  losing control of his Ford Bronco while driving drunk. To this day, he works 
  as a cameraman in Salt Lake City, and prefers to avoid interviews.</p>
