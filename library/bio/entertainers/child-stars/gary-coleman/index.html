<h1>Gary Coleman</h1>

<p><i>"You know, somehow, some way, we need to get this state back in shape. 
  Back in order. And someone like me, someone who's new and not a politico, [is] 
  going to shake the trees and poke the bushes, and needs to be in there."</i></p>
<p><i><img src="intro.jpg" width="423" height="313" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></i>Everyone 
  who's sick and tired of <b>Gary Coleman, </b>raise your hand. Every time you 
  turn around, there he is with his fucking face plastered onto a new and different 
  canvas. Hey look - someone's made a sticker out of him! Now he's an animated 
  gif! We should totally make a unauthorized T-shirt containing Gary Coleman's 
  likeness hovering atop the phrase <b>BLING BLING</b> in a funny pimp font and 
  whore it out on Cafepress. Then let's Photoshop together a picture of David 
  Hasselhoff clutching an Atari joystick poking out of Erik Estrada's police shorts. 
  Is that all the food groups?</p>
<p>For twenty-five years, the world's been inescapably awash in shticky Coleman 
  merchandise, and the ongoing California recall election confirms it won't be 
  disappearing any time soon. The East Bay Express, an Emeryville-based alternative 
  weekly has posted his $3,500 filing fee and performed all the prerequisite paperwork 
  needed to get Gary Coleman on the governor's ballot. Sources at the paper insist 
  Coleman's got a "Clintonesque" charisma - and on October first, Gary 
  Coleman and adult film star <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/mary-carey/">Mary Carey</a> will "debate" the issues on 
  the Game Show Network. Gee, now there's a rivalry that goes way back. <i>Who 
  Wants to Be Governor of California? </i>will award the maximum corporate campaign 
  contribution allowed by law - $21,000 - to Mary or Gary.</p>
<p><img src="arnoldjethro.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Everything 
  from woeful (but legitimate) <i>Diff'rent Strokes</i> TV memorabilia to a smattering 
  of recently manufactured (but faux-faded) Gary Coleman lunch boxes, bobbleheads 
  and bumper stickers blossom across the American landscape like never before. 
  The Coleman nostalgia-revival phenomenon is a relentless, dunderheaded machine 
  with one singular purpose: to actively fellate and destroy everyone on Earth 
  who insists upon celebrating the 1980s.</p>
<p>Constituents of every age group have latched on to Coleman's diminutive stature, 
  impish bouffant, and chubby-cheeked, eternally pre-teen potato pout. One draining 
  side effect is that today's top journalists are presently running "short" 
  of ways to call attention to Coleman's height - which has held firmly at four 
  feet, eight inches for two decades. NBC, The SF Chronicle, <i>E! Entertainment 
  News,</i> TechTV, and Fox continue to describe the thirty-five year old Mr. 
  Coleman as "pint-sized".</p>
<p>Before the man, there was the boy. Prior to his fifth birthday, Gary Wayne 
  Coleman underwent three separate operations to conquer <i>lupus nephritis</i> 
  - an inflammation of the kidneys and a disease of the immune system which proved 
  advantageous to his acting career. At age nine, he could still pass for a five 
  year old. He would never grow taller than 4'8", and to this day he remains 
  on dialysis. He's experienced continued kidney malfunction and two failed transplants. 
  Of his childhood celebrity status <i><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><img src="twikigarycoleman.jpg" width="155" height="195" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></b></font></i>he 
  muses, "once you're there, you're there until death. There's no release 
  from the spotlight."</p>
<p><i><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"></font></i>His parents 
  steered him toward primarily black sitcoms like <i>Good Times</i> and <i>The 
  Jeffersons</i>. After a string of excellent luck, they steered him toward primarily 
  white sitcoms like <i>Facts of Life</i> and <i>Buck Rogers in the 25th Century</i>.</p>
<p>The first episode of <i>Diff'rent Strokes</i> aired in 1978. Theme song lyrics 
  and music written by Alan Thicke. Conrad Bain plays multi-millionaire Phillip 
  Drummond, who agrees to the death-bed wish of his housekeeper: he'll raise her 
  two small sons as his own, welcoming 8-year-old Arnold (Gary Coleman) and 12-year-old 
  Willis (<a href="/library/bio/entertainers/child-stars/todd-bridges/">Todd Bridges</a>) into his lavish penthouse alongside daughter Kimberly 
  (<a href="/library/bio/entertainers/child-stars/dana-plato/">Dana Plato</a>). This premise took place long before popular interracial gangbangery 
  like the <i>Blacks on Blondes</i> franchise or Dogfart vidcaps. At the top of 
  his form, Coleman was earning <b>$70,000</b> a week. Since that time, he has 
  yet to tackle a dramatic role meant to eclipse his portrayal of Arnold Jackson, 
  and he runs the risk of being forever typecast as the little boy who takes off 
  his shirt to play Tarzan with Maytag repairman (and <i>WKRP in Cincinnati </i> 
  star) Gordon Jump.</p>
<p><i><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><img src="81gary1.jpg" width="142" height="192" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Diff'rent 
  Strokes</b></font></i><b><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> 
  #114: The Bicycle Man.</font></b><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> 
  Unaware that he's being lured into the carefully crafted trap of a child molester, 
  Arnold eagerly agrees to perform a simple task in return for an overly generous 
  reward from a "friendly" neighborhood merchant. With Gordon Hump as 
  Mr. Horton and Shavar Ross as Dudley. (Cc, Stereo)</font></p>
<p><i><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><img src="shavarauto11.jpg" width="200" height="245" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></b></font></i>But 
  Mr. Molester Man wasn't the only one misfondling Arnold's ample assets. Coleman's 
  mother and father misappropriated his entire $3.8 million dollar trust fund, 
  and Coleman joined the ranks of actors like Macaulay Culkin, successfully suing 
  his own parents. Coleman won a judgment in court for $1,280,000.</p>
<p>Health and financial issues eventually forced Coleman to concede that he was 
  indeed worse than broke - he was $72,000 in <i>debt</i> and addicted to the 
  assembly of hobbyist model trains.<br>
  <br>
  <i>"It's part of who I am as a person. It is the best hobby I think there 
  is anywhere. You can involve yourself in electronics, computers, puzzles... 
  there's a lot of creativity and brain working. There's a lot to model trains 
  that people don't realize."</i></p>
<p>Coleman has promised not to spend any money wooing voters. Nor will he accept 
  any contributions or donations. He won't even actively campaign, which leads 
  many observers to wonder if a "do nothing" candidate is really what 
  California needs at this critical juncture. He's openly candid about his stance 
  on marijuana: "There's been medical marijuana ever since there's been medicine. 
  Nobody gets hurt, so why not? People still smoke marijuana, and they still go 
  to work. There's no drug-related crime and robberies and murders in countries 
  like, oh - lemme pull one out of my ass here - Denmark. Or Belgium."</p>
<p>He approves of homosexuals, but the only legitimate background resource presently 
  available to voters (apart from Coleman's criminal record) is an examination 
  of his conduct from 1978 to 1986 - the Arnold Jackson years. Let's take a look.</p>

<p><img src="BABF07.gif" width="166" height="118" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Lying, 
  scheming, drinking <i>and</i> womanizing? These characteristics aren't altogether 
  incongruous with post-dot-com California politics, but they're a revealing portrait 
  nonetheless. Gary versus Gray, eh? Davis was a junior high school pass monitor, 
  Coleman worked as a security guard. Davis thinks class size matters, Coleman 
  believes size never matters. Davis is synonymous with rolling blackouts, while 
  Coleman remains rockin' and blackilicious. Gary Coleman for Governor of California? 
  He may not be a pro - but at least he's not a con. <i>I'm talkin' bout choo, 
  Davis!</i></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><i><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><img src="5a.gif" width="150" height="175" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></font></i></font>The 
  real scandal took place July 30, 1998, while Coleman was shopping at a uniform 
  supply store for a bulletproof vest,. A 205-pound woman named Tracey Fields 
  started screaming at him for a personalized autograph. He obliged her, but that 
  wasn't sufficient. As he walked away, she hollered, <b>"Ain't you gonna put 
  something nice on it?!" </b>Coleman was annoyed and taken aback by her persistence. 
  <i>Court TV's</i> Bryan Robinson has the scoop:</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"I thought, 'That's 
  really rude. I didn't like that,'" Coleman said. "But I didn't think 
  anything of it. I told her, 'You really don't need that. You're just going to 
  show it off to your friends. That's really my signature'"<br>
  <br>
  <img src="tvg.jpg" width="325" height="477" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"> 
  Coleman claimed Fields became irritated at his refusal to personalize the autograph. 
  He said Fields told him he was a "rude badass." Coleman described 
  Fields as being "very attitudinal" and having a "me-first, I'm-one-of 
  your-fans attitude, as if I'm supposed to kowtow to her." <br>
  <br>
  Coleman said he responded by telling Fields she herself was rude. Fields then 
  told him that his "badass attitude" was the reason that he has never 
  been a success as an adult actor, he said.<br>
  <br>
  "She made sure that everyone in the store heard her," Coleman said. 
  "It was hurtful. I thought to myself, 'This can't be happening...this can't 
  be happening.' So I decided she didn't need an autograph. I felt she didn't 
  deserve it."<br>
  <br>
  At that point, Coleman said, he took the autograph, ripped it up and threw it 
  in a trash basket. That was when the argument really became heated, he testified.<br>
  <br>
  "She said to me, 'Well, you're just a little punk-ass bitch!'" Coleman 
  told jurors. "I told her she was really rude, to which she said, 'Well, 
  fuck you! I'm not going to watch you on television anymore!' And I said, 'No, 
  fuck you, lady!"<br>
  <br>
  </font>Coleman testified that in retrospect, he should have left the store. 
  He sensed things were getting out of hand. This "fan" was angry, and 
  much larger, and looming ever closer toward him. He was nervous.<font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><br>
  <img src="020499_colemanstand.jpg" width="120" height="90" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"> 
  <br>
  <img src="cbs.jpg" width="240" height="360" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"> 
  "She was getting scary. The hair on my neck was beginning to stand on its 
  end," Coleman insisted. "She's a very large, buxom woman in my face....Her 
  breasts were practically hitting me in the head. I'm 4-foot, 8 inches, 86 pounds 
  of nothing."<br>
  <br>
  "I was getting scared, and she was getting ugly," he recalled. "The 
  volume at which she was shouting...she was shaking the ceiling tops. After she 
  bristled and got a little huffy and blocked my path, I decided, well, she looks 
  like she wants to slap the taste out of my mouth" </font></p>
<p>So Coleman punched her in the right eye. Shopkeepers claimed he continued pummeling 
  the woman until an off-duty cop pulled them apart.</p>
<p>After a full day on the witness stand, Coleman abruptly (and tearfully) copped 
  a plea, ending the trial. With his attorney Adam London clutching him on the 
  shoulder, Coleman blew his nose as he received a 90-day suspended sentence, 
  a $400 fine and a $1,180 penalty assessment fee. He was also ordered by Commissioner 
  Ulysses Burns to take 52 anger management classes.</p>
<p>Will Governor Gray Davis receive a blackened eye as well? (In addition to the 
  one he's already got, that is). Will a landslide win for Gary Coleman really 
  result in smaller government? "I am worth more than any gold in any reserve," 
  Coleman states. "I'm here, I'm alive and I'm going to survive this and 
  any other atrocity that may come up in my life." </p>
<p>When asked by Howard Stern if he's had ever oral sex, an outraged Gary replied, 
  "No! That's not a place for a young woman's face to be."</p>
