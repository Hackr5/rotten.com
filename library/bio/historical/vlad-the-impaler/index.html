<h1>Vlad the Impaler</h1>

15th century prince in Transylvania, immortalized in Bram Stoker's
gothic novel <i>Dracula</i>. Vlad preferred to execute enemies and the occasional random townsperson with anal impalement. By this means perhaps
100,000 unpleasantly lost their lives: "Dracula usually had a horse
attached to each of the victim's legs and a sharpened stake was
gradually forced into the body. The end of the stake was usually oiled
and care was taken that the stake was not too sharp; else the
victim might die too rapidly from shock."
