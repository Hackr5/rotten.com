Killed <a href="/library/travel/cities/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a> Mayor Moscone and Harvey Milk.
<p>

<blockquote>
The <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> reports an article published in the October issue of <i>San Francisco</i> magazine reveals Dan White, who murdered Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk on Nov. 27, 1978, also intended to kill Willie Brown, San Francisco's current mayor, and former Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver.
<p>

<blockquote>
"I really lost it that day," White said. 
<p>

"You can say that again," Falzon answered.
<p>

"No. I really lost it. I was on a mission. I wanted four of them."
<p>

"Four?" Falzon said.
<p>

"Carol Ruth Silver -- she was the biggest snake of the bunch.
<p>

"And Willie Brown," White continued. "He was masterminding the whole thing."
</blockquote>

<p>

Harvey Milk, like a lot of San Francisco politicians, had been an ardent supporter of the Reverend <a href="/library/bio/religion/cult/reverend-jim-jones/">Jim Jones</a>' Peoples Temple.
