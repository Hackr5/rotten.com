<p>When <b>Elmer Wayne Henley</b> was fourteen years old, he was approached by 
  a candy factory worker named Dean Allen Corll. Corll had an interesting business 
  proposition: he'd give Elmer <i>two hundred dollars</i> for every boy Elmer 
  brought over to Corll's home. Elmer's friend David Brooks was in on the deal 
  too, and Corll supplied him with a car to make transporting the boys that much 
  easier. Never mind the fact that Brooks was way too young to drive. Together, 
  this trio would orchestrate the torture and murder of 27 boys, some as young 
  as nine.  
<p> <img src="henley.jpg" width="120" height="120" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right"> 
  Boys were invited to Corll's house under the guise of attending a party. There'd 
  be liquor there, of course. And drugs, and girls. Guests were plied with intoxicants 
  until they were so disoriented they could barely speak, and often they'd simply 
  pass out. Upon awakening, they'd discover they were strapped and handcuffed 
  to a two-by-four. Here, they'd be abused, tortured, and sexually assaulted for 
  days. Their pubic hairs were plucked out one at a time. Objects were 
  inserted into their rectums, and glass rods were shoved into their urethra and 
  smashed. Genitals were removed, and all were sodomized. Sometimes they were 
  strangled, other times they were shot. When a victim died, his body was discarded 
  and the process of finding a new boy would begin again.
 
<p> These games ended on August 8, 1973. Elmer committed the unpardonable sin 
  of inviting over fifteen year old runaway Rhonda Williams - <b>a <img src="henleypolaroid1.jpg" width="275" height="325" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="left">girl</b> 
  - something which definitely wasn't allowed. Elmer, Rhonda, and two young friends 
  sniffed paint varnish and glue until they passed out. When they woke up, all 
  four discovered they'd been tied to the rack by Corll, who was now brandishing 
  a gun. Elmer, no stranger to what victims on the rack were subjected to, pleaded 
  with Corll for his release. He promised to kill the girl while Corll had his 
  way with one of his friends. Corll agreed, and released Elmer from his restraints.
   
<p> Corll demanded that Elmer rape Rhonda <i>right that second</i>, but poor Elmer 
  was too nervous and distracted to perform sexually. Corll began making fun of 
  Elmer's impotence, prompting Elmer to grab a .22 caliber pistol. He shot Corll 
  six times in the head and upper body. Then he released the others, who ran away.

  <p>
  Then he called the Pasadena police department. "Y'all better come right 
  now. I killed a man. The address is 2020 Lamar." Then he called his mother.
  
<p> Elmer led officers to a boat shed in southwest Houston, where the corpses 
  of eight young men were unearthed, the first of 27 in various locations, and 
  Elmer was charged with murder. In July of 1974, he and David Brooks were sentenced 
  to six consecutive 99-year terms, one for each victim they personally disposed 
  of. To this day, Elmer creates art from his prison cell, and he donates one 
  third of his Houston art show profits to charity.</p>
