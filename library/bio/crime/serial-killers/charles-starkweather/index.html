<hr>

<p>This "Rebel Without a Clue" commenced a murder spree that was 
unparalleled for more than three decades. You may have heard of
him in such films as <i>Natural Born Killers</i> or <i>Badlands</i>,
though perhaps killing was the only thing Starkweather excelled at.
His boss: "Sometimes you'd have to tell him something two or 
three times. Of all the employees in the warehouse, he was the
dumbest man we had."
