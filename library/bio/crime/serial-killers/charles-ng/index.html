<h1>Charles Ng</h1>

Charles Ng and Leonard Lake were quite a pair: they would kidnap women, rape them and keep them sealed in a little room. When they were finally finished with their captives, they would execute and bury them in shallow graves. Leonard Lake managed to commit suicide by cyanide pill while in police custody but Ng escaped to <a href="/library/history/countries/canada/">Canada</a> where he shot a security guard and ended up in prison there. After much legal fighting and threats from the United States to Canada, he was finally deported to stand trial. Ng was a particularly cruel captor, preferring to beat women instead of rape them. </p>
