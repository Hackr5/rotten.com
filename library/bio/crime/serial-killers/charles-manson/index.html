Let's get something straight: Charles Manson never killed anybody. He was the mastermind behind the <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/sharon-tate/">Tate</a> murders in the late 1960's, providing specific instructions to his followers. This small-time thief managed to charm young hippie girls into doing his bidding. His obsession with the lyrics of rock group <a href="/library/culture/beatles/">The Beatles</a> made him believe a race war was coming. While everybody fought it out, his band of followers would wait in the desert, only to return when things calmed down. Before being sentenced to die in California's gas chamber (later commuted to life) he recorded some music, committed petty crimes and hung out with hippie chicks. He remains in Pelican Bay State Prison, a highly secure facility for incorrigible offenders, to this day.

Flirted with <a href="/library/religion/scientology/">Scientology</a> in prison:
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
A cell partner turned me on to Scientology. With him and
another guy I got pretty heavy into Dianetics and Scientology. Through
this and by other studies, I came out of my state of depression. I was
understanding myself better, had a positive outlook on life, and knew
how to direct my energies to each day and each task.
