<a href="/library/sex/anal-sex/">Sodomized</a> and killed 100 boys in <a href="/library/history/countries/pakistan/">Pakistan</a>. All of the boys were street urchins which he drugged, molested, strangled and then dissolved in vats of acid, keeping their shoes and clothes as trophies. About halfway through, began a photodocumentation of his efforts, which he sent to police when the goal of 100 was attained. As nobody in Islamabad notices when a street urchin goes missing, Iqbal claims he could have achieved 500 had he the desire.
<p>

<blockquote>
"I am Javed Iqbal, killer of 100 children... I hate this world, I am not ashamed of my action and I am ready to die. I have no regrets. I killed 100 children."
</blockquote>
<p>

Javed means <i>immortal</i>; Iqbal means <i>desire</i>. This gentleman is not to be confused with Javed Iqbal, cricket player, or Javed Iqbal, surgeon, or several other prominent Javed Iqbals in Pakistan.
