<h1>Harry "Pittsburg Phil" Strauss</h1>
Strauss is said to have killed around 500 people during his stint as a <a href="/library/crime/organized/murder-inc/">Murder Inc.</a> employee.
<p>
Strauss was a consumate professional as is evidenced by a hit he described that took place in Florida.
<p>
He tailed his target for days until the victim entered a movie theater. On the way in, Strauss found a fire axe on a wall in the lobby. He grabbed the axe, walked calmly into the theater, and slammed it into the man's skull. As the theater erupted into a screaming mass of  terrified patrons, Strauss screamed and ran out with the crowd acting like just another frightened movie goer.<p>
Fried in the electric chair.<p></p>
