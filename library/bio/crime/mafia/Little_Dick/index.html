<p><p>
Little Dick was a 15 year old girl, despite the moniker. She lived in San Francisco around 1850, an original gangster far in excess of any OG rapper.
</P>
<p>
Little Dick was quite vicious, especially when dealing with the myriad Chinese immigrants that called San Francisco an expatriate home. She was known to tie fireworks into their long Qi braid, or set fire to businesses owned and operated by Chinese folk.
</P>
<P>
The most famous tales of her attribute a certain whimsical nature to her torture of these people. She's said to have said that her favorite thing in life was to drag a chinese man under a deck or a building and stab him to death slowly with her legs wrapped around his middle.
