"You know what I hate? <a href="/library/culture/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> fans: get a friggin life, you boring geeks. You know what I hate? People who mispronounce words, like 'acrost,' and 'pacific' for 'specific,' and 'expresso' instead of 'espresso.' You know what I hate? People who drive slow in the fast lane, God these people do not know how to drive. You know what I hate? The WB network!!!! Oh <a href="/library/bio/religion/jesus-christ/">Jesus</a>, <a href="/library/religion/marian-apparitions/">Mary</a> Mother of God Almighty, I hate that channel with all my heart and soul." - Excerpt from Eric Harris' diary

What fun is life without a little death? It's interesting, when I'm in my human form, knowing I'm going to die. Everything has a touch of triviality to it." Last entry: "Walk in, set bombs at 11:09, for 11:17. Leave, set car bombs. Drive to Clemete Park. Gear up. Get back by 11:15. Park cars. set car bombs for 11:18. get out, go to outside hill, wait.

<td valign=top><font size=-1>Zero Hour. After their homemade timebombs fail to detonate in the school cafeteria, the heavily-armed duo of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold decide to prowl through Columbine High School, indiscriminately gunning down classmates. A total of 15 are killed in their shooting spree: 12 students dead, 1 teacher, Harris dead from self-inflicted sawed-off shotgun in mouth, Klebold from bullet to left temple via TEC-9. Contrary to news reports, their selection of victims is apparently random; they aren't hunting for jocks or blacks. Nor do they execute that Christian girl -- Valeen Schnurr in fact manages to crawl away and live to tell her story. They are not goths, they aren't gay, nor were they ever members of that dorky clique calling themselves the "Trenchcoat Mafia." They don't even listen to <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/music/marilyn-manson/">Marilyn Manson</a>. Harris and Klebold are just a couple of extremely pissed-off kids with an arsenal.</font></td>
