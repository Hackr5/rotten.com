<h1>Martin Bryant</h1>
<h2>Port Arthur Massacre</h2>

<ul>
<li>IQ of 66, putting him at an impressively low 1.17th percentile. While still able to function independently in society, he received the nickname <i>Stupid Marty</i>.
<li>Made lewd comments to almost any female. Loved <a href="/library/culture/pornography/">pornography</a> and was obsessed with <a href="/library/sex/bestiality/">bestiality</a>. Frequently hired prostitutes. Creepy. Enjoyed violent films, his favorite <i>Child's Play II</i>.
<li>Inherited approximately $500,000 after the suicide of his father and the death of Helen Harvey, killed in an automobile accident (in which Martin was passenger.)
<li>Bryant had no significant firearms experience, but he owned 200 teddy bears.
<li>The <i>Port Arthur Massacre</i> sparked gun reform in <a href="/library/history/countries/australia/">Australia</a>, though none was really needed. Tasmania in particular, where this massacre occurred, sported a very low murder rate, in which guns involved only a fraction.
<li>A <i>New South Wales</i> police report indicates that 29 shots were fired at the <i>Broad Arrow</i>, 19 ending as fatal head shots, 1 other fatal shot, and 12 wounded. In about 90 seconds. A very interesting statistic.
<li>Bryant's AR-15 was found with an exploded cartridge in the chamber, exploded with a force not normally seen for a bullet of this calibre. If this had occurred while the weapon was being held, severe injury would have resulted to the operator -- amputation, burns, or firearms discharge residue. At time of arrest, Bryant was burned from the fire at Seascape Cottage, but his hands were uninjured.
<li>Has made four suicide attempts while in prison.
<li>Current residence Risdon Prison.
<li><a href="/library/bio/religion/cult/lyndon-larouche/">Lyndon LaRouche</a> publication <i>EIR</i> asserts that Bryant was a "patsy" brainwashed by the <a href="/library/conspiracy/tavistock-institute/">Tavistock Institute</a>.
