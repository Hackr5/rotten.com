Ran a series of boys clubs from 1974-ish to the 1990's. Other adults considered him a bit too "militaristic" or "authoritarian" for their tastes. For many years this was Hamilton's primary source of income, though rumors of unseemly behavior dogged him. And they were probably just that, rumors -- Hamiton was likely a lifelong homosexual virgin.

One psychologist stated Hamilton had a "persecution complex." He certainly felt others were out to get him, and he considered himself a victim of <a href="/library/conspiracy/freemasonry/">Freemasonry</a> and the power status quo.

<td valign=top><font size=-1>"While unable to give concrete evidence against this man I feel that too many 'incidents' relate to him such that I am far from happy about his having any association with Scouts. He has displayed irresponsible acts on outdoor activities by taking young 'favorite' Scouts for weekends during the winter and sleeping in his van, the excuse for these outings being hill-walking expeditions. The lack of precautions for such outdoor activities displays either irresponsibility or an ulterior motive for sleeping with the boys... His personality displays evidence of a persecution complex coupled with rather grandiose delusions of his own abilities. As a doctor, and with my clinical acumen only, I am suspicious of his moral intentions towards boys." Brian D. Fairgrieve.</font></td>
