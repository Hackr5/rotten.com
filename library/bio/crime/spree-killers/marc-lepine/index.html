<h1>Marc Lepine</h1>

<img src="/library/bio/crime/spree-killers/marc-lepine/marc-lepine.jpg" height="195" width="144" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

Loner, champion misogynist and <a href="/library/history/countries/canada/">Canada</a>'s highest-count spree killer. 
<p>

Marc Lepine's father Liess Gharbi was an Algerian immigrant, a Muslim who taught his boy how to hate women. Not that he particularly cared about his son, whom he considered little more than a nuisance. People were generally shocked how Liess behaved towards his wife and children -- not only the wife beatings, but also little things such as locking Marc and his sister in their bedroom (complete with portapotty), in the name of preserving "peace and quiet" of the household. It's those little things that count.
<p>

Lepine's story is interesting not for the massacre itself, but because it has been co-opted by special interest groups to achieve their own ends -- the anti-gun lobby and women's rights advocates. For a decade, certain critical facts escaped the attention of the Canadian public, among which were Lepine's ancestry and upbringing.
<p>

Lepine used a Sturm Ruger Mini-14 hunting rifle to kill 14 women and wound 13 others. Since Canada's law did not allow any gun that was "firearm of a kind commonly used for hunting or sporting purposes" -- which the Mini-14 certainly was -- the law had to be amended to say that guns may not be banned "if, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, the thing to be prescribed is reasonable for use in Canada for hunting or sporting purposes." In other words, Mark Lapine's massacre was used as a pretext by the Canadian government to pass a law in which any weapon they didn't like is subject to ban. Including the Mini-14, which by any reasonable definition, is an ordinary hunting rifle.
<p>

Mandatory gun registration also came about as a result of Lepine's massacre. At a cost of a <i>billion</i> dollars, some (but by no means all) Canadian guns were placed on a list. The public was not any safer than it was before, and that billion dollars could have put 10,000 more police on the street instead. When considering this figure, note that it took police <i>forty-five minutes</i> to arrive on the scene at <i>L'Ecole Polytechnic</i>.
<p>

Lepine's <a href="/library/death/suicide/suicide-notes/">suicide note</a>:

<blockquote><tt>

Forgive the mistakes, I only had 15 minutes to write this.
See also Annex.
<p>

Please note that if I am committing suicide today 89/12/06 it is not for economic reasons (for I have waited until I exhausted all my financial means, even refusing jobs) but for political reasons. For I have decided to send Ad Patres the feminists who have ruined my life. It has been seven years that life does not bring me any joy and being totally blase, I have decided to put an end to those viragos. 
<p>

I had already tried as a youth to enlist in the [Armed] Forces as an officer cadet, which would have allowed me to enter the arsenal and precede Lortie in a rampage. They refused me because of asociality. So I waited until this day to carry out all my projects. In between, I continued my studies in a haphazard way for they never really interested me, knowing in advance my fate. Which did not prevent me from obtaining very good marks despite not handing in my theory assignments and studying little before exams.
<p>

Even though the Mad Killer epithet will be attributed to me by the media, I consider myself a rational and erudite person that only the arrival of the Grim Reaper has forced to undertake extreme acts. For why persevere in existing if it is only to please the government? Being rather retrograde by nature (except for science), the feminists always have a talent for enraging me. They want to retain the advantages of being women (e.g. cheaper insurance, extended maternity leave preceded by a preventive leave) while trying to grab those of the men. 
<p>

Thus, it is self-evident that if the Olympic Games removed the Men/Women distinction, there would be only be women in the graceful events. So the feminists are not fighting to remove that barrier. They are so opportunistic that they neglect to profit from the knowledge accumulated by men throughout the ages. They always try to misrepresent them every time they can. Thus, the other day, people were honoring the Canadian men and women who fought at the frontlines during the world wars. How does this sit with the fact that women were not authorized to go to the frontline at the time??? Will we hear of Caesar's female legions and female galley slaves who of course took up 50 per cent of history's ranks, although they never existed? A real Casus Belli. 
Sorry for this too brief letter.
<p>

[List of 19 women he wishes to kill.]
<p>

Nearly died today. The lack of time (because I started too late) has allowed those radical feminists to survive.
Alea Jacta EST.
