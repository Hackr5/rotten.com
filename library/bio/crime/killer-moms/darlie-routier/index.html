<h1>Darlie Routier</h1>
<p><b><img src="upstart.jpg" width="300" height="198" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="right"><i>A 
  violent struggle,</i></b><i> in which two children ages 5 and 6 are stabbed 
  to death with a kitchen knife. Their mother is taken into custody. Nerves on 
  all sides crackle in a tense Dallas courtroom as the prosecuting attorney approaches 
  the jury... </i></p>
<p>Thank you, I'll wrap this up as quickly as possible. Ladies and gentlemen, 
  I intend to prove the woman pictured above, Darlie Lynn Routier, stabbed and 
  murdered her own children, Damon and Devon, while they slept in their own home 
  on June the 6th, 1996.</p>
<p>The evidence will show you that this woman, the woman sitting right over there, 
  this spiritless creature with unbleached roots and fake airbag tits, conforms 
  perfectly to the universally-defined textbook definition of <b>predator mommy.</b> 
  Although you'd never guess just by looking at her <font color="#666666"><img src="wh.jpg" width="320" height="233" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="left"></font>three-story 
  mansion in the fashionable suburb of Rowlett, Texas.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><img src="house.jpg" width="226" height="165" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></font>As 
  soon as Darlie Routier moved into this home with her wealthy, entrepreneurial 
  husband Darin, she began snatching up all manner of things which might better 
  illustrate her financial success. Lighted water fountains, satellite dishes, 
  jewelry, fancy clothes, and leather furniture. Even a Jaguar automobile! <b>Bling 
  bling,</b> ma'am! In 1995, the Routiers took several vacations. They bought 
  a nine thousand dollar redwood spa for the backyard. A twenty-four thousand 
  dollar cabin cruiser for the lake. In 1996, Darlie Routier had an expensive 
  new baby named Drake, keeping her busier than she'd ever been with her two other 
  children, Devon and Damon.</p>
<p>But instead of investing or saving the money from her henpecked hubby's thriving 
  business, the defendant preferred to spend the profits on herself. It's no exaggeration 
  to say that in a very short time, the money just plain ran out.</p>
<p><img src="fatad.jpg" width="150" height="133" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10"><font color="#000000"><img src="baby.jpg" width="315" height="227" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></font>And 
  <i>sigh</i>, there was now the matter of her ever-expanding waistline. All that 
  gosh darned weight from her pregnancies. No longer was she the glamorous center 
  of attention. As if it isn't bad enough staring at banner ads targeting fat 
  people every time you check your <i>Yahoo!</i> mail. All these fucking kids, 
  Jesus Christ. No wonder you're so enormous, she must have said to herself. No 
  wonder you're so hyperactive and excitable, desperately clinging to the belief 
  that permanent, perpetual motherhood might somehow fill the void better than 
  a tanning booth or a new Range Rover. And where did <b>my</b> childhood go, 
  anyway? Don't I get that back? Hello? Anyone? I'm still young, here! Who wants 
  to take some E and go dancing?</p>
<p>But there would be no ecstasy for Darlie Routier. No rolling on the bean, no 
  methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Only fat pills. Only Prozac, Xanax, Wellbutrin 
  could possibly keep this material girl's needs at bay.</p>
<p><img src="bob2.jpg" vspace="4" hspace="4" width="127" height="236" align="right"><img src="family.jpg" width="199" height="235" align="left" vspace="4" hspace="4">It 
  all happened so fast, and it just kept getting worse. When the Jaguar stopped 
  running, Darlie had no transportation. That's right: stuck at home <b>all day 
  long</b> with three little shits. This is Rowlett, we're talking about. You 
  have to walk a<i> long way in the hot sun</i> just to find a mattress outlet. 
  The cabin cruiser on the lake? That wasn't working either. Exacerbating her 
  inability to find inner happiness was the fact that her husband's business was 
  starting to flatten out. This family of five had no savings account, no retirement 
  account, and less than $2000 in the bank. If Darlie's mental state was a cartoon 
  sound, it would be Sideshow Bob's slide whistle, twiddling sadly from high to 
  low.</p>
<p>Their situation grew so bleak, that on June lst of 1996 - five days before 
  the murders - the Routiers tried to borrow five thousand dollars from a bank 
  in Rowlett. Because of their hemorrhaging credit situation, they were turned 
  down.<br>
  <br>
  Darlie Routier was becoming angry. The lifestyle she'd grown accustomed to, 
  the vacations, the buying sprees, the freedom - those things were starting to 
  disappear. There had to be more to life than this. How to get it? How to get 
  back on top? Something had to go. It wouldn't be the cedar-beamed cathedral 
  ceilings, nor the French attic bathroom flooded with natural light. It couldn't 
  be the espresso machine - but ah, the <i>cutlery!</i> <b>That</b> would prove 
  itself an indispensable component of Darlie's preferred solution. </p>

  reeling back from the overwhelming smell of blood. Breathing deeply to contain 
  his senses, he instructed Darlie to lay towels across Damon, and apply pressure 
  to his wounds. She ignored him. She continued to scream at the officer that 
  the intruder might still be in the garage. She described her attacker as a man

  Stop talking about that shit, lady! Now might be a good time to clamp your mouth 
  shut already. Darlie Routier might as well have used a potato peeler to whittle 
  these kids down to wedge-cut curly fries. She could have strung them up the 
  backyard lemon tree like a pinata. A plastic Safeway bag. <b>Anything.</b> Ridiculous 
  statements like these delivered moments after a violent midnight crime in her 
  own home quickly drew suspicion, and Darlie Routier became the object of intense 
  scrutiny.<br>
  <br>
  Everything authorities saw at the crime scene was laughable. The lack of a blood 
  trail away from the house. No footprints, no fingerprints. Two adults fighting 
  over a remote control would have resulted in more <img src="martha.jpg" width="151" height="190" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">busted-up 
  furniture, but there were no signs of struggle anywhere in the Routier home.<br>
  <br>
  Okay, fine: a <i>lampshade</i> was askew. But the expensive flowers soaking 
  in Evian water and lemon juice which lay beside a coffee table - fragile stems 
  unbroken - clearly hadn't fallen over. They'd been <b>arranged.</b><br>
  <br>
  How did <a href="/library/bio/business/martha-stewart/">Martha Stewart</a> get where she is today? Not by setting a perfect 
  table and clipping deadheads off the begonias, that's for sure. You've got to 
  <b>take</b> what you want, whatever the cost. Detective Jimmy Patterson conferred 
  with Dr. Townsend-Parchman about Darlie's bruises and neck slashings allegedly 
  perpetrated by the phantom intruder. The boys were maliciously, forcefully attacked 
  - but Darlie's wounds were primarily surface. And <i>odd</i>, like those doctors 
  like to call "hesitation wounds". That is to say: when the knife is deliberately 
  cut into the skin. When pain is encountered, the person holding the blade <b>freaks 
  out</b> and reflexively withdraws it.</p>
<p><img src="wounds.jpg" width="700" height="200" hspace="0" vspace="10" border="0"></p>
<p>It's unlikely a killer would slice two people one way, and a third in a different 
  way. As she sat in the courtroom, Darlie Routier hoped the jury would believe 
  she'd been suffering from <b>traumatic amnesia,</b> and that she couldn't much 
  recall the events of that night. Her recollection of the intruder's appearance 
  had deteriorated to the point of being worthless. Nevertheless, the attack on 
  these children was <i>personal</i>. "The killer focused on their chests," FBI 
  agent Al Brantley emphasized, "almost as if going for their hearts. That indicates 
  an extreme anger."</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="fagz.jpg" width="308" height="232" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="right"></font><b>Amnesia 
  and extreme anger?</b> Toward these two precious little angels sent from heaven? 
  Gee whiz. Yes, let us never lose sight of interchangeable Devon and Damon alongside 
  baby Drake: three costly young boys assigned drippy, melodramatic soap opera 
  names, ultimately destined for onomatopoetic dustbins of disaster. Christ lady, 
  why not Dylan, Daegan and Dakota?<br>
  <br>
  <img src="boyz.jpg" width="222" height="207" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10"> 
  Or hey, what' s wrong with Dalton? What about Darby? Or Duke, Dustin, Dugan, 
  Dudley, Donovan, Dominic, Dolph, Dolan, Dixon, Diego, Dexter, Desmond, Derrick, 
  or Dermot. Or Dennis, or Delbert, for that matter. Why not turn this case into 
  the <b>Dillwad/Dickweed</b> murders?<br>
  <br>
  You're looking at what could have been the Backstreet Boys of a future generation, 
  but Darlie Routier robbed us of that gift. No matter now you choose to dress 
  and fuss over these two foppish would-be homosexual juvenile delinquents with 
  hearts that beat of purest gold - in this particular case, D stands for dead.</p>
<p>Rumor has it when the morgue attendants zipped up what was left of little Devon 
  into the body bag, an officer who considered himself "a pretty tough dude" 
  turned his face away and sobbed. Which leads us to Exhibit SS-1.</p>
<p></p>
<p> <img src="spray.jpg" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10" width="300" height="222">Police 
  maintained diligent 24-hour video and audio surveillance of Damon and De<img src="fa005.gif" width="113" height="150" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">von's 
  <b>grave site</b>, in the hopes of catching Darlie break down or confess during 
  a private, somber moment of remorse. They didn't have to wait long. On what 
  would have been Devon's 7th birthday, Darlie organized a posthumous graveside 
  picnic party sing-a-long ice cream social, where she was videotaped spraying 
  a can of fluorescent pink <i>Silly String</i> all over the freshly-padded grave. 
  She laughed, chewed bubble gum, and sung Happy Birthday. Local television station 
  KXAS-5 TV <i>(Kicks Ass TV)</i> was invited along to record the event, more 
  or less negating the cops' need to maintain surveillance in the first place.</p>

  party guests stood mute and skeptical as Darlie Routier shrieked "I love 
  you, Devon and Damon!" without any noticeable signs of grief. One was reminded 
  of that big ol' black lady who screamed "I hate you Jeffrey" at the 
  Dahmer trial.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To justify her actions, Darlie later said, "If you knew [my sons], you'd know 
  they're up in heaven having the biggest birthday party we could ever imagine. 
  And though our hearts are breaking, they wouldn't want us to be unhappy. But 
  they'll be a part of us always. And they played with Silly String all the time."</p>
<p><img src="ss2.jpg" width="300" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Darlie 
  Routier's defense team rushed to squelch the significance of the Silly String 
  tape. Would the prosecution honestly have the jury believe this harmless, candy-colored 
  aerosol foam lends insight into the mind of a distraught mother? By concluding 
  this can of <i>Silly String</i> was tantamount to some kind of murder weapon? 
  God knows you can certainly <i>annoy</i> someone with sillied string. It's wet 
  and wiggly, even ice cold when first ejected. It's sticky and surprising. And 
  then, without so much as a moment's notice, it solidifies into a Styrofoam-like 
  consistency around your face. It restricts your breathing. It's impossible to 
  remove from hair. It robs you of your dignity, your <img src="ss1.jpg" width="300" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">self-respect, 
  maybe even your soul. But would that be "silly" enough for this Texas 
  jury?</p>
<p>You can hold the can against the side of your nose and shoot fake snot streams 
  across the room, while horrid gurgling noises percolate from your throat. We 
  all saw <i>Big</i> with Tom Hanks. We've all seen <i>America's Funniest Home 
  Videos</i>, where the 11-year-old birthday girl is sprayed by six party guests 
  while blowing out her candles. She was instantly engulfed by flames - but the 
  substance all by itself is <b>harmless.</b> The label clearly says <i>non-toxic.</i></p>
<p>Why don't we return to the grave site in our imaginations? Bailiff, you take 
  the can while I put on this modest party hat. Now take three big steps back 
  and hose me down. Gimme a whole lotta pressure. A whole lotta good squirts up 
  and down. <i><b>Do it!</b></i> We're having a wake! We're mourning the passing 
  of two dead children! Soak me good! Shoot it out! <i>Yes!</i></p>
