<h1>Fred 
  Rogers</h1>
<p>Latrobe, Pennsylvania is responsible for two main exports worthy of note: <i>Rolling 
  Rock</i> bottled beer, and America's best loved television neighbor, <b>Mister 
  Rogers.</b></p>
<p>Frederick McFeely Rogers was born in 1928, a year before the stock market crash 
  brought about the Great Depression. His company, <i>Family Communications,</i> 
  made over <b>one thousand</b> television programs at the studios of WQED in 
  Pittsburgh; each designed to help children understand our often baffling world.</p>
<p>He wasn't an actor, but a child development specialist who gave children the 
  confidence to talk about their feelings, express themselves through art, and 
  imagine make-believe worlds. His offscreen lifestyle was identical to that of 
  his television persona: a reassuring adult who was not only happy to sit and 
  talk, but one who managed to live out his entire life without the slightest 
  whisper of scandal -- unless you count one the time he nearly missed a hole 
  while buttoning up his cardigan. He wrote the scripts, the music, the dialog 
  between players, and all the songs in <i>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. </i>The 
  program started in 1968, and ultimately became longest-running program on PBS.</p>
<p>The opening theme, <i>Won't You Be My Neighbor,</i> is meant as a genuine invitation 
  to the viewer. Each program conforms to a simple pattern, with <b>all</b> of 
  Mister Rogers' actions encouraging a deeper understanding of the outside world. 
  The act of arriving onstage in a formal suit and tie, then changing into both 
  a colorful sweater <i>and</i> beige or navy blue loafers is meant to mirror 
  what a child witnesses as his parents leave for work in the morning and come 
  home at night. Each visit begins with an introductory discussion of something 
  he's brought along with him: art supplies, a kite, sticks of chalk, even a bear 
  costume. <br>
  <br>
  <img src="bwsweep.jpg" width="450" height="448" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"> 
  Sometimes the props are simpler, like cardboard toilet paper tubes. The household 
  objects have a dual role: they spark a child's interest in creating something 
  from nothing, and they speak to audience members from lesser-income families, 
  where fancier toys might not be readily available. He feeds the fish and speaks 
  to them, demonstrating a sense of care and responsibility for others. And in 
  every program he sits down with a red trolley on an electric track which transports 
  them to a surreal other-world, the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, populated with 
  puppets and human characters like Lady Aberlin, Robert Troll, Neighbor Aber, 
  Mayor Maggie, Handyman Negri, and Miss Paulificate. Some children catch on to 
  the fact that Mister Rogers is not only the puppeteer, but also the voice of 
  King Friday, Queen Sara, Daniel Striped Tiger, Lady Elaine Fairchilde, Henrietta 
  Pussycat, X the Owl, Donkey Hodie, Grandpere, chair manufacturer Cornflake S. 
  Pecially, and numerous others.</p>
<p>Several times a week, Mister Rogers inserts a reel of 8mm film or a videotape 
  into <i>Picture Picture,</i> a multimedia home entertainment system so-called 
  because the central viewing rectangle is centered inside two gold picture frames. 
  He shows hypnotic, supremely watchable documentary segments where kids get to 
  see how everyday things -- pretzels, pencil erasers, teddy bears, toothbrushes 
  -- are assembled by daunting machinery inside industrial factories, packaged 
  by hand, and shipped to the neighborhood corner stores across America.</p>
<p><img src="coming-going.gif" width="150" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Fred 
  went to Latrobe High School and started college at Dartmouth in New Hampshire, 
  before transferring in 1951 to Rollins College, a liberal arts institution and 
  the oldest recognized college in Florida. Here he earned a degree in music composition. 
  From there, he <i>had</i> planned to go on to the seminary -- but before he 
  could do so, he got a chance to see something relatively new at his parents' 
  house, something called a "television".</p>
<p><img src="king-friday.jpg" width="150" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Well, 
  Fred thought <i>television</i> was perfectly horrible. He had never seen anything 
  so fumbling or poorly executed. He promptly announced to his family that he 
  wasn't going into the seminary after all, he'd be doing television instead -- 
  he'd seen enough, and now he wanted to dip his hands in it. He went to NBC, 
  where he worked his way up the ladder, delivering coffees. He worked as a floor 
  director on <i>The Gabby Hayes Show,</i> a showcase of Western films. He also 
  maintained sets and stages for <i>The Lucky Strike Hit Parade, The Kate Smith 
  Hour,</i> and <i>NBC Opera Theatre</i>. It was here that he learned that television 
  -- when done correctly -- could be a very intimate medium, and he wondered if 
  the best way to deliver messages to untold thousands of people over live TV 
  might be as simple as pretending there was only one lonely child out there watching 
  the screen.</p>
<p><img src="corner.jpg" width="450" height="336" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">In 
  July of 1952, Fred married Joanne Byrd, whom he'd met at Rollins. The next year 
  they moved to Pittsburgh, where Fred decided to help start America's first community-sponsored 
  television station, WQED. There was a lot of paper folding, envelope stuffing, 
  and solicitation for donations -- and at the time, there were only six people 
  trying to get "educational television" on the air. He worked with 
  a perky young actress named Josie Carey, and together they created the station's 
  first regular educational program, <i>The Children's Corner.</i></p>
<p>This was a charming, beautiful program which featured lively, improvised discussions 
  between Josie and a number of Fred's puppet characters -- many of whom would 
  later become regulars in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Fred worked behind 
  the scenes, giving each puppet voice characterizations and a personality. The 
  most notable was Daniel Striped Tiger who lived in a clock. He was originally 
  going to be a cuckoo bird, but an error in communication with a prop manager 
  produced a tiger puppet instead. Henrietta Pussycat also came into existence, 
  but she could only say three phrases punctuated by "meows": <i>telephone, 
  beautiful, </i>and <i>Mister Rogers.</i> X the Owl represented Fred's scatterbrained 
  side, while King Friday was official and pompous -- an easily understood metaphor 
  for powerful authoritative systems like government and the police department.</p>
<p><img src="bwkiss.jpg" width="313" height="237" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">"We 
  would talk," Josie remembers. "And we were only supposed to do two 
  or three minutes of material, but some days it would be so interesting we wouldn't 
  stop. And we'd ask each other on the air, me and the puppets, whether or not 
  we were having an <i>intellectual</i> conversation. And we'd agree yes, it was 
  intellectual, and we'd go on with it."</p>
<p>It was live TV, and since Fred had to run quickly and quietly behind the scenes 
  (back and forth between puppet stages) before each broadcast he'd take off his 
  shoes and change into sneakers, a habit which stayed with him throughout his 
  television career. The program remained popular with children and adults, and 
  stayed on the air until 1961.</p>
<p>The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) gave Fred his next opportunity 
  to produce programs for children. When Fred went north, he took many of the 
  puppets from <i>The Children's Corner</i> with him, and began to call their 
  world the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. The studio set pieces as we know them 
  today -- the castle, the tree, Daniel Tiger's clock, the Museum-Go-Round, the 
  schoolhouse, the platypus mound, the Eiffel Tower, the schoolhouse in Some Place 
  Else and the trolley -- were actually constructed for Fred by the Canadian Broadcasting 
  Company.</p>
<p><img src="place-ourown.jpg" width="150" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><img src="at-piano.jpg" width="210" height="210" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The 
  Canadian program was one word: <i>MisteRogers</i>, and for the first time, Fred 
  was in front of the camera. The show was a hit in Canada, but before long Fred 
  had two sons, and he and Joanne moved back to Pittsburgh. Also by this time, 
  after years of part-time study, Fred had become an ordained Presbyterian minister.</p>
<p>"What if you were offered an hour of live television every day?" 
  Fred wondered aloud, in several interviews. "Can you imagine what it's 
  like to try to fill that up with something of value? I wanted to give the best 
  I could."</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, the U.S. Senate was considering cutting in half an important 
  twenty million dollar grant for so-called "public broadcasting". Fred, 
  not yet famous with adults, was invited to speak and submit a paper at the hearing. 
  He would plead his case -- what makes public television different, why his program 
  differs from cartoons and violence elsewhere on the dial -- and he would do 
  so before the notoriously gruff and impatient Senator John O. Pastore [D] from 
  Rhode Island. Pastore was the first Italian American elected to the United States 
  Senate in 1950.</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>Senator Pastore:</b> All 
  right Rogers, you got the floor.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>Fred Rogers:</b> Senator 
  Pastore, this is a philosophical statement [motioning to a text copy of the 
  essay he'd submitted] and would take about ten minutes to read, so I'll not 
  do that. One of the first things that a child learns in a healthy family is 
  trust, and I trust what you've said, that you'll read this. It's very important 
  to me, I care deeply about children, my first--</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>Senator Pastore:</b> [interrupting] 
  Will it make you happy if you read it?</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><img src="senate.jpg" width="350" height="251" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Fred 
  Rogers:</b> I'd -- just like to talk about it, if it's all right --</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>Senator Pastore:</b> [interrupting] 
  Fine.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>Fred Rogers:</b> This 
  is what I give. I give an expression of care every day to each child, to help 
  him realize that he is unique. I end the program by saying, "you've made 
  this day a special day by just your being you. There's no person in the whole 
  world like you, and I like you just the way you are." I feel that if we 
  in public television can only make it clear that feelings are mentionable and 
  manageable, we will have done a great service.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>Senator Pastore:</b> [After 
  a long pause] I'm supposed to be a pretty tough guy. This is the first time 
  I've had goose bumps in the last two days.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>Fred Rogers:</b> Well 
  I'm grateful. Not only for your goose bumps, but for your interest in our kind 
  of communication.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><img src="lprogers.jpg" width="187" height="179" align="left"></b></font>Fred 
  spoke for about six minutes total, taking the time to recite lyrics from one 
  of his songs.</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>Fred Rogers: </b>Know 
  that there's something deep inside, that helps us become what we can. For a 
  girl can be someday a lady, and a boy can be someday a man.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>Senator Pastore: </b>[visibly 
  misty and touched] I think it's wonderful. That is just so wonderful. Looks 
  like you just won the twenty million dollars.</font></p>
<p><img src="2.rogers.jpg" width="209" height="165" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Spontaneous 
  applause thundered throughout the courtroom. By that time, National Educational 
  Television (the precursor to PBS) had already started broadcasting Fred's programs 
  nationwide in black and white. <i>MisteRogers</i> made its debut on February 
  19, 1968. Eventually the show would be in color, <i>Mister Rogers</i> would 
  be split into two words, and the set and furniture would be updated -- but only 
  by small degrees to prevent emotionally sensitive children from becoming confused. 
  Senator Pastore died in 1994. One year later, his Senatorial position would 
  be assumed by another Italian American, the homophobic <a href="/library/sex/sodomy/santorum/">Rick Santorum</a> [R], also 
  from Pennsylvania.</p>
<p> Michael <i>"Batman-Beetlejuice-Mr. Mom"</i> Keaton, a native Pittsburgher, 
  operated both <i>Picture Picture</i> and the electric trolley mechanism when 
  he worked on the studio crew during the 1970s. Sometimes when Fred slid the 
  compartment back to insert a film into <i>Picture Picture</i>, Keaton would 
  intone, "I'm ready to hear your confession, my son."</p>
<p><img src="elaine.jpg" width="350" height="489" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">It 
  was for this new national series that Fred asked <b>Johnny Costa</b> to be his 
  musical director. This was a surprising choice, since Costa had an extraordinarily 
  nuanced and sophisticated musical style, especially for a children's program. 
  Each day, Costa's musical trio performed all the songs <i>and</i> music <b>live 
  in the studio,</b> as each episode of <i>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</i> was 
  videotaped. The trolley whistles, Mister McFeely's frenetic <i>Speedy Delivery 
  </i>piano plonks, and the vibraphone flute-toots as Fred sprinkles flakes of 
  fish food into the aquarium were also performed live, as well as Fred's entrance 
  and exit songs. Discerning listeners can easily observe that no rendering of 
  any score across two episodes of <i>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</i> are even 
  close to identical.</p>
<p>Fred considered Johnny one of the most gifted musicians he'd ever met, and 
  one of the most talented jazz pianists in the world. When Costa first started 
  working with Fred, he was a little nervous. Costa wasn't sure how to write <b>jazz</b> 
  for children, but Fred allowed him to do whatever he wanted. Through Costa's 
  enthusiastic and twinkly musical score, one couldn't help but feel the program 
  was a labor of love, constructed by gifted, sensitive individuals intent on 
  child development. Songs performed by Mister Rogers are delivered at a slow 
  pace and address unusual topics, such as the fear of being slurped down the 
  bathtub drain, or a celebration of everyone's body being both fancy <i>and</i> 
  just fine the way it is. Songs which encourage kids to pick up their blocks 
  and put them away (or to pound clay when they're "feeling so mad they could 
  bite.") have earned Mister Rogers the honorary subtitle of the <i>singing 
  psychiatrist</i>.</p>
<p>"I must be an emotional archaeologist," Fred says, "because 
  I keep looking for the roots of things. Particularly the roots of behavior and 
  why I feel certain ways about certain things."</p>
<p><img src="rogersbig2.jpg" width="298" height="239" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">On 
  Tuesday, July 28, 1998, more than 300 PBS stations aired an episode of <i>Mister 
  Rogers' Neighborhood</i> featuring Koko, the sign-language using gorilla. This 
  week-long series addressed the confusion and fear young children often experience 
  when confronted with new situations or people who look different from themselves. 
  The week long theme of "inclusion" featured Koko and helpful talks 
  about feeling included, no matter what a child can or can't do. Dispelling the 
  age-old myth of gorillas as frightening monsters, Koko's affinity for Mister 
  Rogers was immediately apparent. His quiet manner soon had Koko so relaxed that 
  she had her arm around him and was intent on removing his sweater and shoes.</p>
<p>In 1968, Rogers was appointed Chairman of the Forum on Mass Media and Child 
  Development of the White House Conference on Youth. Besides two George Foster 
  Peabody Awards, Emmys, Lifetime Achievement Awards from the National Academy 
  of Television Arts and Sciences and the TV Critics Association, Fred Rogers 
  received <b>every major award in television</b> for which he is eligible -- 
  and many others from special-interest groups in education, communications, and 
  early childhood. In 1999, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. 
</p>
<p><img src="bigstar.jpg" width="350" height="417" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Fred 
  Rogers received more than 40 honorary degrees from colleges and universities, 
  including Yale University, Hobart and William Smith, Carnegie Mellon University, 
  Boston University, Saint Vincent College, University of Pittsburgh, North Carolina 
  State University, University of Connecticut, Dartmouth College, Waynesburg College, 
  and his alma mater, Rollins College.</p>
<p>In 2002, President George W. Bush presented him with the Presidential Medal 
  of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, recognizing his contribution 
  to the well-being of children and a career in public television that demonstrates 
  the importance of kindness, compassion and learning. Unfortunately, during the 
  ceremony, President Bush kept referring to the program as "Mister Rogers's 
  Neighborhood".</p>
<p>Subject matter on <i>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</i> grew increasingly complex. 
  Topics like adoption and divorce were introduced, as well as death. In one program, 
  Fred shows viewers one of his fishes who's passed on. Special visitors to the 
  "Neighborhood" over the years have included Tony Bennett, Big Bird, 
  cellist Yo-Yo Ma, The Boys Choir of Harlem, children's author Eric Carle, folksinger 
  Ella Jenkins, Julia Child, pianist Van Cliburn, magician David Copperfield, 
  marine biologist Sylvia Earle, Arthur Mitchell and his Dance Theatre of Harlem, 
  actress Rita Moreno, paper sculptor Ben Gonzales, tv stars from "The Incredible 
  Hulk" Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, poet May Sarton, Steeler football wide 
  receiver Lynn Swann, Broadway star Tommy Tune, oboist Natasha, creator and author 
  of the <i>Arthur</i> books Marc Brown, Soviet children's television host Tatiana 
  Vedeneeva, pianist Andre Watts, Olympic gold medalist ice skater Peggy Fleming, 
  the Mississippi Fife and Drum Corp, classical <img src="icecream.jpg" width="450" height="398" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">guitarist 
  Manuel Barrueco, Apollo XV astronaut Al Worden, potter Eva Kwong, violinist 
  Hilary Hahn, and the performers from the off-Broadway production <i>Stomp</i>.</p>
<p>The last episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood aired Friday, August 31, 2001. 
  Fred Rogers died shortly after being diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2003. 
  He was buried in a private ceremony attended by sixty relatives, co-workers, 
  and friends, but he told very few people he was sick.</p>
<p>David Newell, who played Mister McFeely on the program, served as the family 
  spokesman. After Newell delivered the news, virtually every metropolitan newspaper 
  in the United States started Fred Rogers' obituary on their front pages -- even 
  tabloids which typically favor lurid local stories. The <i>New York Post</i> 
  led its edition with a story of scandal. "Sizzling affair with drug wife 
  sinks narc," the headline ran. Then, a few inches below, the paper began 
  a two-page "special homage" to Mister Rogers. </p>
<p>Bette Midler's touring show "Kiss My Brass" offers a tender musical 
  tribute to Mister Rogers. Joining him in a "virtual duet," she sings 
  a rendition of I Like to Be Told -- along with full screen video taken from 
  the program.</p>
<p><img src="fg2.jpg" width="308" height="236" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Even 
  the FOX animated series <i>Family Guy</i> made an effort to pay tribute to <i>Mister 
  Roger's Neighborhood </i>in the episode "Brian in Love". Baby Stewie 
  emerges from trolley tunnel holding a pop-gun, announcing that Mr. Rogers should 
  "avoid the Neighborhood of Make Believe today, as I dare say you'll find 
  it quite in ruins." </p>
<p><img src="fg3.jpg" width="266" height="234" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Mister 
  Rogers pokes his head through the porthole, and sure enough: the castle has 
  been bombed and burned beyond recognition. King Friday and Queen Sara swing 
  back and forth from home-made hangman's nooses. Daniel Striped Tiger and Prince 
  Tuesday are seen chained in the basement. X the Owl flops lifelessly with two 
  broken wings in his tree branch. Lady Elaine Fairchilde spins lifelessly in 
  circles from the Museum-Go-Round, her head bonking repeatedly against cement 
  blocks -- and Henrietta Pussycat runs dazed through the neighborhood with a 
  jinglebell, roaring with flames and screaming <i>"meow meow meow - skin 
  graft - meow meow meow." </i>The Mister Rogers vs. Stewie gag aired once, 
  but was cut from subsequent airings. The fully restored edit can only be seen 
  in the DVD box set.</p>
<p>One of Fred's bright red cardigan sweaters (knitted by his late mother) is 
  enshrined in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington, 
  D.C., along with Archie Bunker's easy chair and the set from the M*A*S*H television 
  series. The Smithsonian staff reports that the Mister Rogers sweater is the 
  third most-requested item by tourists.</p>
<p><img src="train.jpg" width="450" height="294" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">There 
  was a moment at the 1998 Daytime Emmys when Mister Rogers was presented with 
  a Lifetime Achievement Award. Tom Junod covered the story for <i>Esquire</i> 
  magazine.</p>
<p>"...Mister Rogers went onstage to accept the award -- and there, in front 
  of all the soap opera stars and talk show sinceratrons, in front of all the 
  jutting man-tanned jaws and jutting saltwater bosoms, he made his small bow 
  and said into the microphone: <i>All of us have special ones who have loved 
  us into being. Would you just take, along with me, ten seconds to think of the 
  people who have helped you become who you are. Ten seconds of silence.</i></p>
<p>And then he lifted his wrist, looked at the audience, looked at his watch, 
  and said, <i>I'll watch the time.</i> There was, at first, a small whoop from 
  the crowd, a giddy, strangled hiccup of laughter, as people realized that he 
  wasn't kidding, that Mister Rogers was not some convenient eunuch, but rather 
  a man, an authority figure who actually expected them to do what he asked. And 
  so they did. One second, two seconds, three seconds -- and now the jaws clenched, 
  and the bosoms heaved, and the mascara ran, and the tears fell upon the beglittered 
  gathering like rain leaking down a crystal chandelier. And Mister Rogers finally 
  looked up from his watch and said softly, <i>May God be with you</i> to all 
  his vanquished children."</p></p>
