<h1>Martin Luther King, Jr.</h1>

Prominent negro clergyman <a href="/library/history/assassination/">assassinated</a> by <a href="/library/bio/crime/assassins/james-earl-ray/">James Earl Ray</a>.
<p>

<a href="/library/bio/usa/j-edgar-hoover/">J. Edgar Hoover</a> instituted a surveillance campaign against him in 1961. In 1963 he received approval from Attorney General <a href="/library/bio/usa/robert-f-kennedy/">Robert Kennedy</a> to bug King's home and offices. In October, the FBI issued an internal report.
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
The attached analysis of Communism and the Negro Movement is highly explosive. It can be regarded as a personal attack on Martin Luther King. There is no doubt it will have a heavy impact on the Attorney General and anyone else to whom we disseminate it. It is labeled TOP SECRET.
</tt></blockquote>
<p>

In late 1964, Hoover called TIME magazine's "Man of the Year" and recent recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize "the most notorious liar in the country" to a group of journalists. Earlier that year, Marquette University received a phone call from the FBI, recommending that they abstain from giving King an honorary degree. The same thing happened to Springfield College. The FBI claimed that King was "Communist affiliated."
<p>

<a href="/library/bio/usa/jesse-helms/">Jesse Helms</a> excoriated him on the Senate floor in October 1983.
