<h1>Dick Wolf</h1>
<p>In the entertainment industry, particularly with respect to television, if 
  you're always dolled up and ready for a glamorous photo shoot, you're probably 
  a nobody. If you dress like an off-duty cop and you shamble around with an expressionless 
  <a href="/library/bio/pornographers/larry-flynt/">Larry Flynt</a> slump while claiming not to know very much about TV, chances 
  are you're responsible for something important and lucrative in the world of 
  show business.</p>
<p>Executive Producer <b>Dick Wolf</b> <i>(b. December 20, 1946)</i> is just such 
  a man. He came from the advertising world: his father was a publicist, and young 
  master Dick learned the fine art of packaging products at an early age. He likens 
  his master creation, the fourteen-year-long <i>Law & Order </i>franchise 
  filmed entirely on location in New York (<i>Law & Order, Law & Order: 
  Special Victims Unit,</i> and <i>Law & Order: Criminal Intent</i>) to different 
  flavors of toothpaste or Campbell's soup.</p>
<p><img src="Dick_Wolf.jpg" width="150" height="191" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><img src="1538448.jpg" width="162" height="225" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">"I 
  learned branding from Procter & Gamble. There are seven Crests: they're 
  different tastes, but the reason they can do seven is because people know, 'oh, 
  it's Crest. I can buy it.' There are 312 toothpastes out there and none of them 
  are any better than Crest. And the one rule on brand extensions is there is 
  no such thing as a bad brand extension except one that doesn't work. Because 
  that hurts the whole brand. Like New Coke. If <i>Special Victims Unit</i> had 
  turned out to be a flop, I think it would have really negatively affected <i>Law 
  & Order</i>. If you're going to eat soup, you see the can, you go, 'well, 
  I've never had that but I'm sure if I wanted Cream of Mushroom theirs is going 
  to taste as good as any other cream of mushroom.'"</p>
<p>The format of <i>Law & Order</i> was derived from a 1950s police drama 
  called <i>Arrest & Trial</i>. The "Bible" for <i>Law & Order</i> 
  -- the place where stories are "ripped from the headlines" -- is the 
  front page of the <i>New York Post</i>. The dialog of the program rarely veers 
  from the narrative structure offered by the old <i>Dragnet</i> series: just 
  the facts and not much chit-chat about anything else. When Law & Order first 
  came out it was rated poorly, at 77th place <img src="1ORDad03.jpg" width="239" height="360" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">in 
  the Neilsens. Wolf still has all the original reviews. He knew that all dramas 
  take a full season to take shape, and he also knew that during the first year 
  of any non-situation comedy, there are usually a few good episodes inbetween 
  absences of consistency. <img src="image_wolf.jpg" width="180" height="156" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">"The 
  first twenty-two episodes of <i>Law & Order</i> are a roller-coaster," 
  Wolf winces. "A lot of <i>oops,</i> that didn't work."</p>
<p>The show has been nominated for the most consecutive Emmy Awards of any primetime 
  drama series (11) , but has only secured one. Since that time, there have been 
  numerous references in <i>Law & Order</i> to both September 11th and <i>Queer 
  Eye for the Straight Guy.</i></p>
<p>Interference from NBC is a thing of the past, but they did control many aspects 
  of the show early on. At the end of the third season, NBC executive officer 
  Warren Littlefield informed Wolf that he would need to put more girls in the 
  show or risk cancellation.<br>
  <br>
  "I can't just add women, I'd have to get rid of characters." Wolf 
  remembers saying, "And Littlefield said, 'Yep, you do.' That was the worst 
  phone call -- it was horrible. And I think Dann [Florek] if you talk to him, 
  I certainly remember the phone call, I said, '''Dann, I'm going to tell you 
  something you are not going to believe. You have been unbelievable, you've shown 
  up on time every day, every episode, you've known your lines, you've never bumped 
  into the furniture, you've got a great demeanor, and you're fired.'"</p>
<p><img src="2ORDak03.jpg" width="359" height="239" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Wolf's 
  least favorite of all 300 episodes is the one where the daughter of Detective 
  Lennie Briscoe [Jerry Orbach] gets killed by a drug dealer. "It was exactly 
  what the show wasn't, but Jerry has pled for years, "Please let someone 
  die in my arms so I can get nominated." And it was so not the show it kind 
  of screamed at you. The odds of a detective having a daughter who is murdered 
  by a drug dealer are -- zero! Sorry, that's how it is." Orbach has mentioned 
  in interviews on more than one occasion that "there's only so many times 
  we can canvas the neighborhood."</p>
<p>"I've never understood the obsession with younger writers and dramas," 
  Wolf told a reporter. "Comedies I understand, but how do you write drama 
  at 23, you haven't experienced anything. You know about 23 year olds. It's kind 
  of hard to write about 60 year old EADA's. Only a couple of us are 60 years 
  old so far, but there are not many 23 year olds who can write about life-changing 
  situations unless it's medical. That sounds weird, but there's not the mileage 
  on the odometer to get under the surface. There are exceptions that prove the 
  rule --Dickens wasn't bad at 23."</p>
<p>Wolf has one regret. "I shouldn't have had Jill Hennessey [Claire Kincaid] 
  die. That was 'cause she would have come back. She wanted to do episodes and 
  I said, 'you're dead.'"</p>
