<h1>Roy Cohn</h1>

As the right-hand-man of <a href="/library/bio/usa/joseph-mccarthy/">Joseph McCarthy</a>, Roy Cohn targeted homosexuals. But he himself was a closeted <a href="/library/sex/homosexuality/famous/">homosexual</a>, <a href="/library/sex/heterosexuality/famous/">denying</a> his homosexuality, and later, denying the <a href="/library/medicine/epidemics/aids/">AIDS</a> he had been afflicted with the last two years of his life. Cohn possessed a large collection of stuffed animals -- adorable! Dated Barbara Walters (total beard).
<p>

Cohn pulled strings for one of McCarthy's assistants (and Cohn's lover), G. David Schine, to get out of the Army.  A cropped photo was used to imply that Army Secretary Robert Stevens had promoted Schine and sent him home.  But the complete photo hung on Schine's wall.  During the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954, Special Council for the Army, Joseph Welch (the "<a href="/library/history/huac/">Have you no decency?</a>" guy) questioned subcommittee member James Juliana, who doctored the photo, about the discrepancy while simultaneously needling Cohn's sexuality:<p>

I suggest to you that when you looked at that  face, you were looking at the face of very real evil... Evil can be charming.  If  evil always came in a disgusting guise it would easy to recognize, it wouldn't be a much of a threat, would it? Evil can be witty, nothing saying that evil people are dumb. Evil can be cool, particularly when it  marshals itself, when it's vital interests are at  stake.  The face of evil can be quick and sharp,  and can be smarter than any lawyer Richard Dupont can get. But the face of evil is a face of evil." Summation of <i>People v. Dupont</i>, 111 M.2d 592, 444 N.Y.S.2d 810 (N.Y. Cty. 1981.)</font></td>
