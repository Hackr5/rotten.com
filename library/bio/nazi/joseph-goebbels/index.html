<h1>Joseph Goebbels</h1>
<h2>aka Paul Joseph Göbbels</h2>

<img src="/library/bio/nazi/joseph-goebbels/goebbels_handsome.jpg" height="411" width="286" hspace="15" vspace="15" align=right>

The Nazi Minister of <a href="/library/imagery/propaganda/">Propaganda</a>, and the man who defined this 
job for all generations to come. It is largely through his work
that Germans, even in the face of defeat, maintained their
blind obedience to Fuhrer. 
<p>

Which is fairly strange when you consider that the man was only 5'4", a slightly emaciated 100 pounds, possessed a club foot, and was a <a href="/library/sex/virginity/">virgin</a> until age 33. Yes, the eloquent Minister of Propaganda couldn't talk his way into the bed of a lady until he was in his fourth decade of life. 
<p>

After <a href="/library/bio/nazi/adolf-hitler/">Hitler's</a> suicide, Goebbels succeeded the office
as Fuhrer, but kept the post only hours. He and his wife Magda promptly
murdered their six children, and joined Hitler and Eva in
<a href="/library/death/suicide/famous/">suicide</a>.
<p>

After death, Goebbels had a cameo in the <a href="/library/culture/rolling-stones/">Rolling Stones</a> hit, <i>Sympathy for the Devil</i>.
