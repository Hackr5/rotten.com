Genius Florida cartoonist Mike Diana was arrested and jailed in 1994 for distributing his disturbing comic "Boiled Angel". Found guilty of "obscenity", he was fined out the ass and forbidden from drawing for his own personal pleasure. His apartment has been subject to random warantless searches for illustrations by the stupid fucking cops. As for his art, common illustrative themes include veiny cocks penetrating the bleeding vaginas of Jesus, priests skullfucking little boys with their veiny bleeding cocks, and little boys shooting each others' cocks off with guns. He has since moved to greener pastures where he continues violating his Florida state court ruling and risking imprisonment due to his flagrant regard for the 1st Amendment. This is an important artist who deserves your support. He also has a nice bod.
