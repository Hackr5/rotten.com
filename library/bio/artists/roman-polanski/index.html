<i>"Don't tell your mom."</i> You've gotta <strong>know</strong> you just committed a crime when that's what you say to your sex partner in the afterglow.
<p>

In 1977, Roman Polanski, took thirteen-year-old Samantha Geimer over to Jack Nicholson's house in Bel Air while the actor was away. Polanski, director of the films <i>Chinatown</i> and <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>, had arranged to snap photos of the girl in her swimsuit, for the French edition of <i>Vogue</i>.
<p>

Eventually, the pair took a dip in the hot tub, and Roman gave the girl champagne and quaaludes. Afterwards, there was fucking. But then Samantha <i>did</i> tell her mom. Polanski was arrested shortly thereafter and charged with six criminal counts:
<p>

<ol>
<li>rape of a minor
<li>rape by use of a drug
<li>committing a lewd act upon a person less than 14 years of age
<li><a href="/library/sex/oral-sex/">oral copulation</a>
<li><a href="/library/sex/sodomy/">Sodomy</a>
<li>furnishing drugs to a minor
</ol>
<p>

Ultimately, Polanski took a plea bargain and acquiesced to one count of unlawful sex with a minor. But then he fled to <a href="/library/history/countries/france/">France</a> before the sentencing hearing. He has never been back to the United States since.
<p>

But then, it's not like he has lots of fond memories of the U.S. After all, it was in America that his pregnant wife, 26-year-old film actress <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/sharon-tate/">Sharon Tate</a>, was brutally murdered along with four guests by the <a href="/library/bio/crime/serial-killers/charles-manson/">Manson Family</a>. They stabbed Tate repeatedly in the belly and then slit her open to see the eight-month-old fetus.
<p>

Polanski gave <a href="/library/bio/religion/anton-lavey/">Anton LaVey</a> a cameo in <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>.
<p>

Twenty-six years later at the 75th annual Academy Awards, Polanski won Best Director for his film <i>The Pianist</i>. He has yet to return to the states to claim his complimentary statuette.
