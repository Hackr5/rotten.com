<h1>Friedrich Nietzsche</h1>

People discover this <a href="/library/history/countries/germany/">German</a> philosopher in one of two ways: either they're forced to 
  read about him in school, or they're curious about all the references to "Nietzsche" 
  made by <a href="/library/culture/monty-python/">Monty Python</a>.<p>

  He was a brilliant student with rigorous training in German, Latin and Greek. 
  At the age of 24, Nietzsche was appointed professor of classical philology at 
  the University of Basel. His first book, <em>The Birth of Tragedy,</em> was 
  a series of dialogs arguing that death is perhaps the best possible thing a 
  human being could ever hope for. Although it garnered immediate critical acclaim, 
  historians consider this early work a little fumbly. He seemed to be "guesstimating" 
  a lot, sprinkling his text with phrases like <em>perhaps, maybe,</em> and <em>what 
  if.</em> It was like he had plenty of <a href="/library/crime/drugs/marijuana/">marijuana</a> and a quality bong, but nothing 
  to start a real fire.<p>

Later he'd write a book appropriately titled <em>The Gay Science</em>, a conversation 
  with numerous fictional characters who do in fact discuss how gay science is. 
  A "madman" in one portion of the play famously announces that <strong>God 
  is dead,</strong> using this simple logic:<p>

<blockquote><tt>
1. Without God, humans are deprived of absolute values or eternal truths.<br>
2. Absolute values and eternal truths rely upon the existence of God.
</tt></blockquote><p>

Essentially 
  this suggests that because God can only exist due to one's own faith, the 
  God-fearing among us are trapped inside a chicken-and-egg infinite loop support 
  system from which no genuine satisfaction can ever be extracted. It was an airtight 
  case which fell apart when people wondered, well, if God is <em>dead </em>then 
  he must have been alive at some point. Even Monks and Buddhists took offense, 
  piping up from their vows of silence to declare that God played no part whatsoever 
  in the act of their spiritual quests. Nietzsche went on to point out that he 
  was not <em>actually talking about God</em>, but rather a fascist European political 
  structure. Either way, Nietzsche's hatred of Christians and religion as a general 
  whole would last a lifetime.  He believed there simply wasn't enough love and 
  kindness in the world to give any of it away to imaginary beings.
<p>

By far, his masterwork was <em>Human, All Too Human </em>first published in 
  1878. This was a dense, heavy text containing piercing observations which lay 
  bare the hidden motivations underlying all aspects of human behavior. The book 
  is organized in sections like a bible. The chapters have titles like <em>Man 
  Alone by Himself, Wife and Child,</em> and <em>Signs of Higher and Lower Culture.</em>Each section is divided up into individual fragments of condensed information, 
  resembling a dictionary:
<p>

<blockquote>
<em> Presence of witnesses.</em> <strong>One is twice as happy to dive after 
  a man who has fallen into the water if people are present who do not dare to.</strong><p>

 <em>The friend's secret.</em> <strong>There will be but few people who, when 
  at a loss for topics of conversation, will not reveal the more secret affairs 
  of their friends.</strong><p>

 <em>Joy in old age.</em> <strong>The thinker or artist whose better self has 
  fled into his works feels an almost malicious joy when he sees his body and 
  spirit slowly broken into and destroyed by time; it is as if he were in a corner, 
  watching a thief at work on his safe, all the while knowing that it is empty 
  and that all his treasures have been rescued.</strong><p>

  <em>The infuriating thing about an individual way of life.</em> <strong>People 
  are always angry at anyone who chooses very individual standards for his life; 
  because of the extraordinary treatment which that grants to himself, they feel 
  degraded, like ordinary beings.</strong><p>

<em>The right profession.</em> <strong>Men seldom endure a profession if they 
  do not believe or persuade themselves that it is basically more important than 
  all others. Women do the same with their lovers.</strong><p>

<em>Boredom.</em> <strong>Many people, especially women, do not experience 
  boredom, because they have never learned to work properly.</strong>
</blockquote>

Nietzsche pounded females and several minorities in this volume, even going so far as to say that doing otherwise would be contrary to Nature. In <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, Nietzsche delivers misogynistic tirades which attack women's intellectual acumen. Indeed, <a href="/library/bio/mad-science/sigmund-freud/">Sigmund Freud</a> often marveled how Nietzsche's hunches and insights behaved in synchronous agreement with the laborious results of academic psychoanalysis.<p>

In between writing and philosophizing, Nietzsche took the time to enter into 
  a strange friendship with composer/musician Richard Wagner, who was more than 
  twice Nietzsche's age. It began well, but publicly degenerated into a bitter 
  intellectual and emotional feud. There existed a jealous and intensely competitive 
  love triangle between Nietzsche, Wagner, and Wagner's wife Cosima. Wagner could 
  be a manipulative brute, and the combined traumatized childhoods of Nietzsche 
  and Cosima bound them in submission to Wagner. Wagner would subjugate them both to seductive, emotionally abusive behavior. Wagner knew about Nietzsche's 
  secret life as a homosexual, and Nietzsche continued to obsess over this fact 
  long after Wagner's death.<p>

In January of 1889, Nietzsche collapsed on a street in Turin, <a href="/library/history/countries/italy/">Italy</a> - rapidly descending into insanity. Some blame <a href="/library/death/maladies/syphilis/">syphilis</a>, which wouldn't have anything resembling a cure for many years. He remained in a state of mental and physical paralysis until his death. Nietzsche's sister ended up with control over his books and papers intended for publication. She hated the Jews more than anything else, and she worked hard to ensure that Nietzsche's legacy would be used to fund the Nazi regime. Maybe that's what Monty Python finds so funny.<p>
