<h1>Richard Milhouse Nixon</h1>

Perhaps best known for <a href="/library/conspiracy/nasa/fake-moon-landing/">faking the Moon landing</a>, 37th US President Richard Milhouse Nixon died on April 22, 1994. He left behind him an astonishing range of sins: Alcoholism, pill popping, wife beating, perpetuating the <a href="/library/history/war/vietnam/">Vietnam War</a>, and calling Helen Gahagan Douglas a filthy lesbian.

Tricky Dicky's ultimate crime was confirming the suspicions of an entire generation of fuckoffs that they, in fact, were the chosen people of their place and time. The results may be seen in the merciless attacks on the human spirit masquerading as '60s nostalgia, ridiculous cam girls indulging in <a href="/library/occult/astrology/">astrology</a>, and the otherwise unexplained persistence of adulation for <i>Creedence Clearwater Revival</i>. 
<p>

Made two visits to China to meet <a href="/library/bio/dictators/mao/">Mao</a>. Appointed <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/music/elvis/">Elvis</a> a secret special agent of some sort.
<p>

According to convicted <a href="/library/history/political-scandal/watergate/">Watergate</a> criminal John W. Dean, Nixon wanted to firebomb the <i>Brookings Institute</i> think tank, because they had possession of certain unspecified, but apparently important documents. Yes, firebomb.
<p>

Pardoned <a href="/library/bio/crime/mafia/jimmy-hoffa/">Jimmy Hoffa</a> on December 23, 1971.
<p>

As chairman of the RNC, it was <a href="/library/bio/presidents/george-hw-bush/">George HW Bush</a>'s job to tell Nixon to resign.
<p>

Agnew</a>, Secretary of State <a href="/library/bio/usa/henry-kissinger/">Henry Kissinger</a>, Watergate plumber <a href="/library/bio/misc/g-gordon-liddy/">G.
