<h1>Bill Clinton</h1>
<h2>America's First Black President</h2>

In a 1998 essay in the <i>New Yorker</i>, author Toni Morrison described Clinton as "our first black president. Blacker than any actual person who could ever be elected in our children's lifetime." She went on to say:
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, <a href="/library/crime/corporate/mcdonalds/">McDonald's</a>-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas.
</tt></blockquote>
<p>

This is just another reason that the Republicans absolutely hated Clinton. <em>"He's getting votes from the minorities just for being <strong>poor white trash</strong> fercrissakes!"</em> He drove them utterly apeshit. The Republican leadership of the House could barely conceal their contempt for the man in their photo ops and press conferences. As far as they were concerned, Clinton was nothing more than a smarmy hick, the former governor of a backwater southern state, and corrupt as fuck. A guy that even had to lie about not <a href="/library/crime/drugs/marijuana/">inhaling</a>.
<p>

In 1994, conservative religious whore <a href="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/jerry-falwell/">Jerry Falwell</a> released the straight-to-video documentary "The Clinton Chronicles: An Investigation into the Alleged Criminal Activities of Bill Clinton." The preacher aired excerpts from the tape on his weekly television show <i>The Old Time Gospel Hour</i>. The back of the box said:

<blockquote><tt>
For the first time on video, a documentary that puts together the whole story! -- The names and faces of the key players who Clinton used to build his <i>Circle of Power</i>... as well as those who got in his way and lost their jobs, reputations, virtue, and lives! From Whitewater to ADFA... From millions in drug smuggling in Mena, Arkansas, to money laundering with the BCCI... From Gennifer Flowers to Paula Jones... From <a href="/library/bio/usa/vince-foster/">Vince Foster</a>'s "suicide" to the gangland slaying of private investigator Jerry Parks.
<p>

THE CLINTON CHRONICLES uncovers the shocking truth the controlled media and Clintons don't want you to know!
<p>

Watch THE CLINTON CHRONICLES for the whole story. You won't find this anywhere else!
</tt></blockquote>
</td>

<p>

The 80-minute tape included footage of Jerry Falwell interviewing a silhouetted journalist who was afraid for his life. The journalist accused Clinton of orchestrating the deaths of several reporters and personal confidants who had gotten too close to his illegalities. All credibility evaporated when it was discovered that this "journalist" Falwell interviewed turned out to be the producer of the video. Not that it mattered. Falwell's fraudulent tape sold well anyway.
<p>

Soon Congress appointed Kenneth Starr as special prosecutor to investigate the President's involvement in the Whitewater real estate scandal. When the Starr Report was finally released, it contained almost nothing about Whitewater. Instead, it focused on Clinton's receipt of oral copulation in the Oval Office and subsequent lying about it under oath. The President had a difficult time trying to explain how his ejaculate encrusted itself on a dress belonging to plump White House intern <a href="/library/history/political-scandal/lewinsky-affair/">Monica Lewinsky</a>.
<p>

<img src="/library/history/political-scandal/lewinsky-affair/clinton_acquitted_cnn.jpg" height="224" width="312" hspace="15" vspace="15" align=right>

Clinton wound up impeached by the House of Representatives, although he was ultimately acquitted in the resulting Senate trial. Among the Congressmen who voted to impeach was Sonny Callahan (R-Alabama). One of the offending blowjobs in question had been performed during a telephone call between President Clinton and Callahan.
<p>

But what else could you expect from a guy whose personal hero was <a href="/library/bio/presidents/jfk/">John F. Kennedy</a>, himself known for frequently dipping the Presidential wick.
<p>

Clinton's legacy is survived by his wife <a href="/library/bio/usa/hillary-clinton/">Hillary Clinton</a> (Senator, D-NY) and his Attorney General <a href="/library/bio/usa/janet-reno/">Janet Reno</a>'s failed attempt to run for Governor of Florida.
