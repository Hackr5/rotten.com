<h1>Ulysses S. Grant</h1>

U.S. President and anti-Semite:
<p>

<tt><blockquote>
"I have long since believed that in spite of all the vigilance that can be infused into post commanders, the special regulations of the Treasury Department have been violated, and that mostly by Jews and other unprincipled traders. So well satisfied have I been of this that I instructed the commanding officers at Columbus to refuse all permits to Jews to come South, and I have frequently had them expelled from the department, but they come in with their carpet-sacks in spite of all that can be done to prevent it. The Jews seem to be a privileged class that can travel anywhere. They will land at any woodyard on the river and make their way through the country. If not permitted to buy cotton themselves, they will act as agents for someone else, who will be at military post with a Treasury permit to receive cotton and pay for it in Treasury notes which the Jew will buy up at an agreed rate, paying gold." <p>
-- Letter to C. P. Wolcott, Assistant Secretary of War, Washington, December 17, 1862.
</tt></blockquote>
<p>

In 1885, <a href="/library/bio/authors/mark-twain/">Mark Twain</a> published Grant's autobiography.
