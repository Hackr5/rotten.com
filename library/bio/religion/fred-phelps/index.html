<h1>Fred Phelps</h1>

God may Hate Fags, but someone should tell Rev. Phelps he looks totally <i>gay</i> in a cowboy hat.

Phelps is a former <a href="/library/culture/eagle-scouts/">Eagle Scout</a>. He runs the infamous <i>God Hates Fags</i> website, featuring among other things, a timeclock: <i>Matthew Shepard has been in hell for 1607 days</i>. Phelpsisms:
<p>

<blockquote><i>
"You can't preach the Bible without preaching hatred."
</i></blockquote>
<p>

<blockquote><i>
"God doesn't hate them because they're fags; they're fags because God hates them."
</i></blockquote>
<p>

If Fred Phelps has made one mistake (and he's made several), it's taking the word of God literally. Phelps read the Old Testament and embraced some of its more controversial messages. Ironically, Fred might be more consistent in his biblical interpretation than his pro-gay Judeochristian brethren.
<p>

Rebuked <a href="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/jerry-falwell/">Jerry Falwell</a> for hosting a summit devoted to nonviolence against homosexuals.

We understand that Iraq is the only Muslim state that allows the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ to be freely and openly preached on the streets without fear of arrest and prosecution. Alas, the United States no longer allows the Gospel to be freely and openly preached on the streets, because militant sodomites now control our government, and they violently object to the Bible message...The same majoritarian sodomite tyranny that now guides the Clinton administration's repressive policies toward Gospel preaching on America's streets, is apparently responsible -- at least in part -- for the merciless slaughter by starvation of 400 innocent Iraqi babies each day in your country. If our government and laws will allow it, and at the invitation of your government, we would like to send a delegation from Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas, to preach the Gospel on the streets of Baghdad for one week in the near future.
