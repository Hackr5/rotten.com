<h1>Thomas de Torquemada</h1>

( 1420-1498 )<br>
        <br>
        <em> <strong><img src="199765.jpg" width="130" height="226" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right"></strong></em>Why 
        did the chicken cross the road? Give Torquemada ten minutes alone with 
        the chicken and he'll find out. The first official Confessor of the Spanish 
        <a href="/library/history/inquisition/">Inquisition</a>, Torquemada presided over the burning of over 2,000 Jews 
        and numerous other heretics. Primarily targeted were <a href="/library/history/countries/spain/">Spain's</a> 
        <em>conversos</em>, or Jews who had been baptized into Catholicism. But 
        it turns out that Jewish blood is so goddamned filthy that even the sacrament 
        of baptism is incapable of rendering it pure. If you were more than one 
        sixty-fourth Jew, if you weren't <em>sangre limpia</em>, look out. Observant 
        historians will note that Torquemada was one sixty-fourth Jew.<br>
        <br>
        Stories about Jews murdering Christian children, otherwise known as <em>blood 
        libel</em>, had been circulating throughout Europe for centuries. The 
        accounts exist entirely without evidence, arguably the result of paranoia, 
        propaganda and anti-semitism - but the murder of Jews by Christians is 
        equally documented, and Torquemada was absolutely convinced that Jews 
        would be the ruination of Catholic Spain.<br>
        <br>
        He was an excellent precursor to <a href="/library/bio/nazi/adolf-hitler/">Adolf Hitler</a>. The Pope agreed to 
        allow the Inquisition in 1481, and those arrested and given four choices. 
        They could<strong> confess,</strong> pay a penalty, endure public torture, 
        or be burned at the stake. Quite often, those arrested were subjected 
        to all of the above. Torquemada's own grandmother was a converso, but 
        he continued to elevate the level of his Inquisition to that of an ethnic 
        cleansing or a full-blown massacre.<br>
        <br>
        Important to the religiously-motivated Inquisitors was that "no blood 
        be spilt," which meant the act torturing confessions out of people 
        required a special science. The favored techniques were flogging, the 
        rack, and red coals applied to the feet. Also popular at the time was 
        the <em>strappado, </em>in which you're suspended by the wrists and incrementally 
        heavier weights are wrapped around your ankles or looped among your toes.<br>
        <br>
        Laying a framework of paranoia were Secret Accusers, people who'd tell 
        on their neighbors or exact revenge against those they carried a grudge. 
        Denying heresy meant torture, and confession led to death. Honesty did 
        <em>not</em> pay during Torquemada's Inquisition, and no lawyer could 
        assist you.<br>
        <br>
        Papal degrees provided a loophole: torture could not be <em>repeated</em>, 
        but it could be <em>continued</em>. Burning at the stake was performed 
        publicly as an <em>auto-da-fé</em>, or act of faith. If the condemned 
        kissed the Holy Cross, they were garroted before the fire was set. If 
        they merely apologized, they were burnt at the stake death with quick-burning 
        Dura-logs. If the accused continued to be stubborn, they were incinerated 
        with slow-burning fresh green wood. Anywhere from 13,000 to 50,000 people 
        were killed, and the Sierra Club has yet to approach the Spanish government 
        for reparations.<br>
        <br>
        To Torquemada's credit, a large percentage of his victims were very wealthy. 
        They were saddled with exhaustive fines, court costs, and jail time. Confinement 
        decimated a significant portion of the upper class. Moneys traveled up 
        the hierarchy of church officials.<br>
        <br>
        Torquemada lived a long life surrounded by comfort before dying of natural 
        causes at the age of 78.</p>
