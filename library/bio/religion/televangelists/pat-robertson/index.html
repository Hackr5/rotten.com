<h1>Pat Robertson</h1>

Just two days after the <a href="/library/history/wtc/">World Trade Center</a> attacks, televangelist Pat Robertson appeared on his television show <i>The 700 Club</i>. During the course of a conversation with his obese colleague <a href="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/jerry-falwell/">Jerry Falwell</a>, Pat mused on the ultimate source of the tragedy:
<p>

<table><tr>
<td valign=middle>
<blockquote><font size=-1>
"We have allowed rampant secularism and occult, <i>et cetera</i>, to be broadcast on television. We have permitted somewhere in the neighborhood of 35 to 40 million unborn babies to be slaughtered in our society. We have a Court that has essentially stuck its finger in God's eye and said, 'We're going to legislate you out of the schools, we're going to take your Commandments from off the courthouse steps in various states, we're not going to let little children read the Commandments of God, we're not going to let the Bible be read -- no prayer in our schools.' We have insulted God at the highest levels of our government. And, then we say 'why does this happen?' Well, why its happening is that God Almighty is lifting His protection from us."
</font></blockquote>
</td>
<td valign=middle><img src="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/pat-robertson/pat_robertson_700_club.jpg" height="254" width="350" ></td>
</tr></table>
<p>

I know, I know: That sounded kind of harsh. Not to mention histrionic. But give the man some credit. Unlike you, Pat doesn't just sit back and gripe about America's flaws; he's out there working his ass off actually trying to do something about them.
<p>

The way he sees it, America has been stuck in the grips of moral decay for the past 40 years. For almost two centuries, our nation had been a shining example for the rest of the God-fearing world. Sure, we've had our share of problems -- for instance: slavery. But by divine providence, we corrected that and a whole host of other moral lapses over the years.
<p>

Beginning in the 1960s, however, the nation began to stray from God's teachings for some reason. Society began to embrace principles which were inimical to the American dream. So in just a handful of decades our country has become a haven for homosexuality, atheism, and false religions (anything other than Judeochristianity). Which makes us ripe for some retribution.
<p>

In keeping with this, Pat's fondest wish is to witness the Tribulation -- the bloody seven-year cataclysm through which God will restore His kingdom on Earth. It's going to be absolutely spectacular. The Lord will finally manifest His divine wrath against the Sodomites, the Feminists, the Secularists, along with all the other blasphemers. But that just can't happen until everything's exactly right. Jesus is waiting for us to restore some of America's godliness. Once that happens, He can get this <a href="/library/religion/armageddon/">Armageddon</a> thing started and then it's party time. Until then, we're stuck in a holding pattern for the duration.
<p>

Banishing sinfulness and immorality from the United States is going to be no small task. But once we're done, things are going to be a lot different around here. We'll have a theocracy and all that entails: book burnings, compulsory religious services, forced conversions. Think Afghanistan under the Taliban regime, except without the ridiculous wardrobe. Plus, it will be based on the actual word of God, instead of some pseudo-religious cult.
<p>

The problem is, our nation is infested with small-minded ideologues caught up in their petty squabbles over utter nonsense. Nobody's focusing on fixing the important problems. Most people don't want to hear about how we need to prepare for the Second Coming. They'd rather indulge themselves by taking drugs, watching R-rated films, and engaging in intercourse outside of lawful marriage.
<p>

So let's face it: getting there from here is going to take a very long time. It took decades of neglect to get into this mess, and it will take at least as long to get out. At least, that's what your typical Christian minister might think.
<p>

What sets Pat apart from other religious leaders is that he's committed to seeing this thing through to the end. And he's getting old, so time is of the essence. Pat is ready to make this transformation happen by any means necessary. He's quickly running out of patience with the legal and peaceful means of effecting change.
<p>

Pat has been tirelessly doing what he can for decades to get America to snap out of it. It began with a TV station.
<p>


<h2>CBN</h2>

In 1960, Pat bought a struggling UHF television station for $37,000 and gave it an evangelistic format. It would be the beginnings of CBN -- the Christian Broadcasting Network. He launched a religious talk show in 1963 and called it the <i>700 Club</i>. It showcased lots of trippy religious stuff, including glossolalia -- speaking in tongues. This was later removed from the show in the 1980s.
<p>

In addition to being a media mogul, Robertson became well-known as a <a href="/library/religion/faith-healing/">faith healer</a>. In one of his 1981 sermons, thankfully preserved on videotape, Pat told his congregation:
<p>

<blockquote><i>
"Satan has gone! God has just healed somebody! A hernia has been healed! Several people are being healed of hemorrhoids and varicose veins! People with flat feet! God is doing just great things to you!"
</i></blockquote>
<p>

Gerard Straub, a former <i>700 Club</i> producer, published <i>Salvation for Sale</i> in 1986. It was a nasty tell-all describing what it was like working with Pat at CBN. It portrayed Robertson as something of an overbearing asshole with delusions of grandeur. In 1979, the network started making detailed preparations to televise the Second Coming of Christ, which they figured was due at any moment. This was known internally as God's Secret Plan, or GSP:
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
The greatest show on earth was in our hands. I wondered where we would put the cameras. Jerusalem was the obvious place. We even discussed how Jesus' radiance might be too bright for the cameras and how we would have to make adjustments for that problem. Can you imagine telling Jesus, "<i>Hey, Lord, please tone down your luminosity; we having a problem with contrast. You're causing the picture to flare.</i>"
</tt></blockquote>
<p>

While he was waiting for Jesus to get off His ass and get down here, Pat decided to work his way into the national political scene. Luckily, there just so happened to be a born-again Christian in the White House.
<p>


<h2>Contras</h2>

<img src="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/pat-robertson/pat_robertson_reagan_1986.gif" height="174" width="180" align=left hspace=15 vspace=5>

Ingratiating himself with the Republicans, Pat joined in the effort to support the <a href="/library/history/political-scandal/iran-contra/">Contras</a> in Nicaragua. After Congress refused to give any more money to the guerrillas, Pat chided: "It's appalling to me that we would debate over $14 million... one attempt to dislodge a communist dictatorship in Central America causes Congress to go into a tizzy over $14 million in aid. There's something wrong with our sickly government, in my humble opinion."
<p>

In April 1985, Robertson attended a fundraising dinner for the Nicaraguan Freedom Fund. Pat gave the invocation and led the audience in the Pledge of Allegiance. President <a href="/library/bio/presidents/ronald-reagan/">Ronald Reagan</a> delivered the keynote address. Despite the group's humanitarian-sounding name, the proceeds went to arm and equip the Contras. Sort of. In fact, the $250-a-plate dinner barely broke even. It spent $218,376 to collect $219,525. Actually, the Nicaraguan Freedom Fund was just a diversion, providing a plausible source for all the cash and supplies flowing to the Contras. In reality, the bulk of the money was handled through other, more clandestine channels.
<p>

The following month, the Christian Broadcasting Network announced they would be sending $20 million for "humanitarian" supplies to Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. It was supposed to be food and medicine -- supplies "of a strictly humanitarian nature" -- for refugees. CBN paid the $2 million shipping bill. Talking to a reporter aboard a C-130 cargo plane carrying medical supplies, Pat admitted that "some may get to the Contras." Ultimately, CBN was one of the top sources of private funding for the Contras. In appreciation, the guerrillas named one of their units the Pat Robertson Brigade.
<p>

Unfortunately for CBN, giving money like this to a government cause would be considered by many to be a political contribution. And, for one thing, it would jeopardize their tax-exempt status. When the news finally broke, they attempted to deny it in a written statement: "CBN is helping starving and displaced persons in 15 countries, including some in Central America. The help is absolutely non-political. Articles claiming support by CBN of the Contras in Nicaragua are incorrect." Later, somebody asked Pat about it. He answered: "The fact is that the Communists make people suffer. If that makes it political, then, I'm sorry, we're still going to help them."
<p>


<h2>Running for President</h2>

<img src="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/pat-robertson/robertson_time.jpg" height="400" width="300" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>

The book by former <i>700 Club</i> producer Gerard Straub, <i>Salvation for Sale</i>, appeared right around the time Robertson started making noises about wanting to run for President. Upon learning Pat's political aspirations, Straub opined: "I'd be very concerned about a man sitting next to a button who believes Jesus is telling him to press that button."
<p>

In his own inimitable style, Pat's first newsworthy statement to the <i>New York Times</i> indicated he had a divine endorsement. In June, Pat had led a prayer vigil urging God to spare Virginia Beach from the wrath of Hurricane Gloria. Perhaps God was listening, because Virginia Beach <i>was</i> spared. (But then again, Gloria landed on Long Island and Boston, inflicting $320 million in damage. Couldn't God have simply caused the storm to dissipate?) Anyway, Pat told the <i>Times</i> that the event was "extremely important because I felt, interestingly enough, that if I couldn't move a hurricane, I could hardly move a nation."
<p>

In September 1986, Pat announced that he would be willing to seek the Republican party's nomination for President <i>if and only if</i> three million people would sign up as volunteers on his campaign over the next year. It worked, and the political donations flowed in. Pat had generated a heaping war chest by the time he officially announced his candidacy in September 1987. But even with a big chunk of change in his pocket, he was still swimming uphill against Vice President <a href="/library/bio/presidents/george-hw-bush/">George Bush</a>.
<p>

Robertson's political platform could have been summed up in a single phrase: pro-Christian. If elected President, Pat promised that his administration would:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Eliminate illegal drugs.
<li>Eliminate <a href="/library/culture/pornography/">pornography</a>.
<li>Revamp the public school system, and reintroduce the Bible to classrooms.
<li>Sever diplomatic relations with the elected government of Nicaragua and recognize the Contra rebels as the nation's "government in exile."
<li>Eliminate the following agencies:
<ul>
<li>Department of Education
<li>Department of Energy
<li>Amtrak
<li>Conrail
<li>The Legal Services Corporation
</ul>
</ul>
<p>


<h2>Supreme Court</h2>

And although Pat never publicly advertised it, there was another work item on his agenda:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Disregard any and all Supreme Court rulings.
</ul>
<p>

In a March 1986 speech to Yale University Law School, Robertson admitted one possible reason why he failed the New York Bar Exam (and thus, never practiced law):
<p>

<blockquote><font size=-1>
"When I was at law school, I studied constitutional law for a whole year. I read a thick book of cases on constitutional law. I did all kinds of research. But I confess to you, I never read the Constitution. I graduated without anybody asking me about that."
</font></blockquote>
<p>

Pat agreed that the Establishment clause forbids the <i>federal</i> government from instituting an official religion. But this is because the Constitution grants that prerogative to the individual states:
<p>

<blockquote><font size=-1>
"The first point in the Bill of Rights, the First Amendment to the Constitution, said '<i>Congress shall pass no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.</i>' There were certain states at that time that had established religions. Massachusetts was a case in point. They had a state religion. And they didn't want this enormously powerful Congress to superimpose a religious system on their state system. To guarantee the states retained critical rights, the tenth amendment said, '<i>All the power that is not expressly delegated to the federal government is reserved for the states.</i>' The intent? The people -- <i>i.e.</i> the states -- have delegated power. They gave up some powers, but they did not give up all powers because they are sovereign states."
</font></blockquote>
<p>

Of course, if Pat's position ever prevails, there are frightening implications. The First Amendment contains a whole lot more than the separation clause. For reference, here's the entire text:
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
</tt></blockquote>
<p>

According to Pat, if you happen to live in a locality where these freedoms are protected, perhaps in the state's constitution, consider yourself lucky. Otherwise, you're subject to the whims of popular approval. In Robertson's view, an American citizen possesses the following inviolable rights only when they happen to be on property of the federal government -- in a Post Office, national park, federal building, military base, or the District of Columbia:
<p>

<ul>
<li>freedom from official religion
<li>freedom of speech
<li>freedom of the press
<li>freedom of assembly
<li>freedom to petition the government
</ul>
<p>

Accordingly, Robertson has come to hate the Supreme Court. Every time they hand down a ruling on the First Amendment which countermands state laws, Pat believes it's an illegal encroachment on the federal system of government. Perhaps as a result, Pat doesn't believe in the legal doctrine of judicial review. He sees <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison</i> as a usurpation of power, without legal merit or Constitutional foundation. (Actually, he has a point on that one.)
<p>

Almost 20 years later, Pat's frustration with the Highest Court of the Land finally boiled over when the Supremes struck down the Texas anti-sodomy statute in <i>Lawrence</i> v. <i>Texas</i>. The pro-<a href="/library/sex/anal-sex/">buttfucking</a> majority opinion finally forced Robertson to publicly urge his followers to pray for God to remove the three most liberal jurists. As he wrote on his website:



<p>

<blockquote><tt>
One justice is 83 years old, another has cancer and another has a heart condition. Would it not be possible for God to put it in the minds of these three judges that the time has come to retire?
</tt></blockquote>
<p>

When Pat said <b>retire</b>, many people took that in the <i><a href="/library/bio/authors/philip-k-dick/">
Blade Runner</a></i> sense: a codeword for "assassinate with extreme prejudice." Naturally, the secular news media freaked out. Robertson was forced to defend his statement in a CNN interview:
<p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=10>

<tr>
<td align=right valign=top nowrap><tt>ROBERTSON</tt>:</td>
<td>This particular court, in my opinion, has turned the Constitution on its ear. It started way back in the '60's and we have had assault after assault after assault on religious values, on other things, and this recent decision, in my opinion, is shocking. It was so broad based. ... And just think, Paula, we've slaughtered something in the neighborhood of 43 million unborn babies because of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i>. And I think the American people are tired of this. They want conservative judges.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=right valign=top nowrap><tt>REPORTER</tt>:</td>
<td>But Rev. Robertson, do you understand why some people are offended, even though you're saying you're not telling your followers to pray for ill health for these three justices, that they could actually interpret it that way.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=right valign=top nowrap><tt>ROBERTSON</tt>:</td>
<td>Well they can interpret it any way they want to. I'm talking to God, and it's up to Him to make a decision and if some of these folks don't like what I'm praying for and want to pray the other way -- have at it! Let the Lord decide.</td>
</tr>

</table>
</blockquote>
<p>

Got that? He's just praying for their <i>retirement</i>, folks. If other people decide to take it upon themselves to suggest to the Big Man Upstairs that he ought to whack those judges, who's Pat to tell them they're wrong? It's the Lord's call whether to impose retirement or summary execution on the offending Justices. So don't blame Pat if God opts for capital punishment. Understood?
<p>


<h2>Presidential campaign derailed</h2>

Back to the 1988 campaign. Robertson started out with a pretty good shot. He possessed a large, dedicated core constituency and a big pile of dough. He might have beaten Bush to the nomination, if he hadn't gotten tripped up by a series of major catastrophes.
<p>

First there were the financial and sex scandals of 1987-88, surrounding televangelists <a href="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/jim-bakker/">Jim Bakker</a> and <a href="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/jimmy-swaggart/">Jimmy Swaggart</a>. Those guys screwed things up for everyone in the industry. People felt betrayed by these men of the cloth. Ratings suffered dramatically, and contributions took a hard hit.
<p>

Robertson tried hard to distance himself from the televangelism scandal, partly because he needed to connect with non-Christian voters. So he was more than happy to acknowledge that, as President, his responsibility would be to the American people as a whole, and not just the Jesus freaks. In  fact, he told <i>Time</i> magazine in September 1987 that he had no plans of staffing his administration with born-again Christians exclusively. He was also planning on including some devout Jews. As he later wrote:
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
When I said during my presidential bid that I would only bring Christians and Jews into the government, I hit a firestorm. "What do you mean?" the media challenged me. "You're not going to bring atheists into the government? How dare you maintain that those who believe in the Judeo-Christian values are better qualified to govern America than Hindus and Muslims?" My simple answer is, "Yes, they are."
</tt></blockquote>
<p>

That was a problem, certainly, but nothing that couldn't be handled. Then Pat hit a real snag, and it killed his Presidential bid.
<p>

In his campaign literature, Robertson claimed to be a "combat Marine" who had served proudly in the Korean War. It didn't take long for Marines who remembered Pat to rebut this statement. They remembered him as the only jarhead with a U.S. Senator for a father. And who, coincidentally, was pulled out of his combat unit and reassigned to a cushy desk job. In fact, Lt. Robertson was known colloquially as his unit's "liquor officer," because it was his assigned responsibility to keep the officer's club stocked with alcoholic beverages from Japan.
<p>

Robertson had never spent a single day in a combat environment, and his claim of having been a "combat Marine" infuriated a lot of people. One of them wrote a letter to his local newspaper, published in February 1988:
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
There is a person who calls himself a combat Marine. He is not. His name is Pat Robertson. I saw him often in the division headquarters where he was clean-shaven and clothed and showered. He was in charge of making sure that the officers' booze ration was handed out and re-supplied. He was a lieutenant. He was in my battalion.
<p>

The line company marines I saw smelled badly, looked poorly. For months at a time they were cold, eating C-rations. Trying to stay warm and dry was a constant battle. These line-company men were the combat Marines of the First Marine Division. Neither Pat Robertson nor I could carry their gear.
<p>

He is trying to get elected by standing on those frozen bodies I saw, by putting himself in the company of those seven Marines who repulsed the enemy. Imagine a person who aspires to be President being so loose with the truth, so lacking in grace and so dishonorable.
<p>

He says God talks to him. I'd like to hear what God says to him about this.
</tt></blockquote>
<p>

Self-aggrandizement by way of dishonoring your nation's war dead is really something you should avoid if you want to run for office... <i>any</i> office, much less President of the United States. People just don't like the idea that their candidate is a lying sack of shit who would say anything just to get elected.
<p>

By the time the Republican national convention rolled around in August, Pat had been washed-up for a long time. In a gracious speech, he urged his remaining supporters to vote for Vice President Bush. But he didn't leave politics. Quite the contrary, in fact.
<p>


<h2>Christian Coalition</h2>

Following his unsuccessful bid for President, Pat acknowledged that he had some explaining to do:
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
In the quest for the highest secular prize our nation has to offer a third place finish is respectable. But my supporters were devastated. It was as it they mourned for the dead. Because they felt -- as I did -- that God had called me to win, not run third.
<p>

So in New Orleans they were asking and I was asking one simple question -- did God call me to run for president or not? And if He did call me to run, why did I lose? And why, with the loss, was there such incredible personal abuse and such enormous financial sacrifice?
</tt></blockquote>
<p>

Whatever the answer, Pat realized that he could never run for office again. It was pointless. But that didn't mean he couldn't get somebody else elected. He immediately set to work building his own political organization. He called it the Christian Coalition. It was conceived as Pat's attempt to insinuate himself into the Republican party leadership.
<p>

The Christian Coalition became a huge force, almost overnight. In a fundraising letter from the Democratic National Committee, the chairman wrote: "Pat Robertson has the most powerful political organization in America." Another observer noted:
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
A blaring neon example of the group's intentions to influence politics directly came on September 17th of 1997, when Pat Robertson addressed about 100 members of the Christian Coalition's state branches. He made a speech wherein he spoke admiringly of the Tammany Hall political machine and declared his desire to select the next President.
</tt></blockquote>
<p>

In its heyday, the Christian Coalition campaigned hard for high-profile, Christian-minded candidates. They supported <a href="/library/bio/usa/oliver-north/">Oliver North</a>'s run for the Senate seat in Virginia. Likewise, <a href="/library/bio/usa/john-ashcroft/">John Ashcroft</a>'s Senate bid in Missouri. And, of course, they endorsed both <a href="/library/bio/presidents/george-hw-bush/">George HW Bush</a> (grudgingly) and <a href="/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">George W Bush</a> (enthusiastically) in their Presidential campaigns.
<p>

Then they got caught improperly using funds to promote specific candidates, and the FEC slapped them with fines. The membership dwindled, and Pat abandoned the organization in December 2001.
<p>


<h2>Business</h2>

If there's one thing Pat understands, it's that religion and business don't mix (except when they do). To underscore this point  during his campaign for President, Pat's wife told reporters: "He is not a television evangelist. He has never been an evangelist. He is a television broadcaster. He has a law degree. He's a businessman. He has a multi-million dollar business that he started with $70. He's a good businessman."
<p>

<img src="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/pat-robertson/pat_robertson_pancakes.jpg" height="228" width="300" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>

Let's start with the mundane stuff. Pat pushes pancake recipes and other nutritional crap. Before that, he sold vitamins and other health supplements through a sketchy multi-level marketing scheme called KaloVita. Eventually, Robertson pulled out of KaloVita after a scathing <i>Newsweek</i> magazine story in 1994.
<p>

In April 2002, Robertson acknowledged owning a race horse, named "Mr. Pat." He told a <i>New York Times</i> reporter that his interest in the horse was based purely on its aesthetics. "I don't bet and I don't gamble. I just enjoy watching horses running and performing." Harder to explain was why he spent $520,000 on the horse and intended the beast to compete at the track. But the resulting furor over Pat's direct participation in a gambling racket eventually caused him to sell the horse a month after the <i>Times</i> story broke.
<p>

<img src="/library/bio/dictators/mobutu-sese-seko/mobutu_map.jpg" height="258" width="170" align=left hspace=15 vspace=5>

But the racehorse scandal was just small potatoes. In the mid-1990s, Pat struck up a friendship with <a href="/library/bio/dictators/mobutu-sese-seko/">Mobutu Sese Seko</a>, the brutal tyrant of Zaire. He took a trip to the African nation with a large entourage on one of Mobutu's personal planes. Then the group was whisked off to his presidential yacht, which took them to his estate. One member of the party characterized their host as quite congenial: "Pat Robertson and Mobutu get along extremely well. Mobutu was interested in bringing in people to get the mining and agriculture operations going again."
<p>

Robertson purchased rights from Mobutu to dredge for diamonds in a remote portion of the Zaire river near Tshikapa. Diamond mining is an expensive proposition. It requires a constant influx of miners and equipment parts. In order to keep his operation supplied with manpower and gear, personnel and materiel had to be flown in from other places. That can get expensive.
<p>

In a cost-cutting move, Pat ferried his cargo aboard planes owned by Operation Blessing, a tax-exempt charity of Robertson's working to deliver medical supplies. In fact, according to two pilots who worked for Robertson, nearly all of the flights they made on the Operation Blessing planes were delivery trips to and from the mining site. Later, one of them told a reporter:
<p>

<blockquote>
"My first impression when I took the job was that we'd be called Operation Blessing and we'd be doing humanitarian work. We got over there and 'Operation Blessing' was painted on the tails of the airplanes, but we were doing no humanitarian relief at all. We were just supplying the miners and flying the dredges from Kinshasa out to Tshikapa."
</blockquote>
<p>

Even after the mining operation went bust a few years later, Robertson kept in touch with Mobutu. Reports claim that he sent a personal messenger "offering his assistance and cooperation" in 1996, when rebels were about to overtake the government's military strongholds. Pat unsuccessfully lobbied the State Department to reinstate Mobutu's visa so he could come to the United States.
<p>

In 1999, Pat struck up a relationship with another African dictator, Liberian strongman Charles Taylor. Robertson stuck an $8 million deal to pursue more mining in his country. This time, he wasn't hunting for diamonds -- he was hunting for gold. According to a Liberian government press release, Pat told Taylor: "I pray that this investment may become a wonderful blessing to the people of Liberia and will be one of the many significant investments that will be made under your administration in the nation of Liberia."
<p>

Pat chartered Freedom Gold Ltd. in the Cayman Islands and dispatched geologists to southeastern Liberia for prospecting. They didn't find much. But that hasn't diminished Robertson's zeal. When President George W Bush started making noises about Charles Taylor having to step down in order to halt the Liberian civil war, the preacher publicly excoriated Bush for failing to support the leader of a sovereign Christian nation, even if he had perpetrated crimes against humanity on a massive scale.
<p>

And then there's China. Pat has business interests in the Communist nation. So when Robertson appeared on CNN <i>defending</i> China's forced-<a href="/library/death/abortion/">abortion</a> policy, it didn't surprise veteran Pat watchers. Here's what he said: "Well, you know, I don't agree with it, but at the same time, they've got 1.2 billion people and they don't know what to do... If every family over there was allowed to have three or four children, the population would be completely unsustainable... so I think that right now they're doing what they have to do."
<p>

Surprisingly, Pat's primary objection to the policy appeared to be rooted in eugenics. As a result of aborting almost exclusively female babies, Pat observed that China will eventually face "a critical shortage of wives. The young men won't have any women to marry, so it will, in a sense, dilute the -- what they consider the racial purity of the Han Chinese. And that to them will be a great tragedy, because then they will have to be importing wives from Indonesia."
<p>

Isn't that really beside the point? Whatever happened to "abortion is evil"? Seems like Pat just doesn't want to piss off his Communist business partners.
<p>


<h2>in the final analysis</h2>

But none of that stuff really matters. The world is going to end any day now, and these piddling indiscretions will be completely forgotten. The only question is: <i>when?</i>
<p>
 
In 1980, Pat announced that the Tribulation would begin in "the Fall of 1982." Unfortunately, this simply did not happen. In his 1990 book <i>The New Millennium</i>, Robertson proposed that the Tribulation would begin on April 29, 2000. Again, no dice. Things like that can be very disappointing. It's almost as though God were purposely fucking with Pat. It's enough to make you question your faith.
<p>

Does Pat still believe that God loves him? Does he actually think that God is protecting him and wants him to be happy? In February 2003, Pat announced that God had afflicted him with potentially life-threatening prostate cancer. Did he turn to faith healing? No. He turned to secular medicine; surgeons excised the cancerous tissue.
<p>

Think about it. Among other things, Pat Robertson is one of the world's most famous faith healers. He does it every day on his television show, <i>The 700 Club</i>. He solicits donations and prays on camera for God to heal people's infirmities. Suddenly, Pat's got cancer. Does he pray the tumor away? No. He hires a surgical team to do God's work for Him.
<p>

Maybe Pat should consider the possibility that the cancer is just God's way of imposing forcible "retirement."

And if we want to destroy the United States of America, take it down, this is the best way to do it. So the homosexuals will have managed to win what's known as a pyrrhic victory -- they may win their temporary battle, but they'll lose the war 'cause they will destroy the society, and that's happening."</font></td>

God picks him up because he's a man of prayer and God's blessing him."</font></td>

And so, it was messy. The Lord told me it was going to be A) a disaster, and B) messy. And before that, I had deep -- in my spirit -- I had deep misgivings about going into Iraq."</font></td>

It's a whole lot cheaper than starting a war, and I don't think any oil shipments will stop. [...] We have the ability to take him out, and I think the time has come that we exercise that ability. We don't need another $200 billion war to get rid of one, you know, strongarm dictator.

I don't know whether it'll be in the fall or September or later on, but it'll be the second half somehow of 2007. There will be some <i>very</i> serious terrorist attacks. The evil people will come after this country and there's a possibility that -- not a possibility, a definite certainty -- that chaos is going to rule. [...] It's going to happen. And I'm not saying necessarily nuclear, the Lord didn't say nuclear, but I do believe it'll be something like that, that'll be <i>mass</i> killing -- possibly millions of people, major cities injured."
