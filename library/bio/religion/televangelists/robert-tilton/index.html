<h1>Robert Tilton</h1>
<p><i>"Take the enclosed poster of me and put it up on your refrigerator or mirror, 
  somewhere so you'll see it every day. Then for the next 21 days, lay your hand 
  on top of mine and agree with me that you deserve a miracle."</i></p>
<p><img src="2001.06.14.tilton.jpg" width="88" height="88" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">In 
  the late eighties and early nineties, television pastor <b>Robert Tilton</b> 
  and his World Outreach Center Church perfected the half-hour religious infomercial. 
  His "Success-N-Life" advertisements, which never actually subscribed 
  to any specific faith, could be seen in all two hundred and fifty three U.S. 
  television markets. For a good long while he managed to avoid the same media 
  scrutiny responsible for bringing down <a href="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/jim-bakker/">Jim Bakker</a>, <a href="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/jimmy-swaggart/">Jimmy Swaggart</a> and 
  numerous others.</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><img src="t2.jpg" width="85" height="85" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></font>Apart 
  from his frosted pompadour and Howdy-Doody dimples, what really set Mr. Tilton 
  apart from the rest were his insane facial contortions, pregnant pauses, indecipherable 
  babblings, and overarching hyperventilated enthusiasm for collecting money under 
  the auspices of serving the Lord. The only thing more insane than his coke-induced, 
  schizophrenic body language was his ridiculous collection of marketing materials, 
  many of which have secured their rightful place in history as perhaps <i>the</i> 
  most entertaining and curious novelties in the world of faith-based brand identity. 
</p>
<p><img src="t7.jpg" width="85" height="85" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">These 
  trinkets were snatched up in the early 1990s by prank-calling teenagers or junk 
  mail enthusiasts who had never seen anything like what Tilton would send to 
  their house for free -- gifts given ostensibly for the purposes of instilling 
  in the recipient an obligation to reciprocate financially. <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><img src="030504_Ne_a1tillton2.jpg" width="252" height="175" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></font>The 
  mailings were often accompanied by testimonials: letters from former sufferers 
  of peptic ulcers, layoffs, cigarette addiction, deadly spider bites, rebellious 
  children, infertility, insomnia, and AIDS. They describe (in impish, hand-lettered 
  fonts) how their lives were "turned around" after sending money to 
  Tilton. Inevitably, these people find the act of telling their stories so profoundly 
  moving that by the last paragraph, the caps lock has been fully deployed.</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><img src="t3.jpg" width="85" height="85" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">My 
  two best friends had just sued me. My landlord had served me with an eviction 
  notice. I was jobless and flat broke. I wouldn't answer the telephone because 
  I knew it would be a bill collector. I was cowering in a chair with all my curtains 
  closed. Heartbreaking love songs gushed from the stereo. I lit a joint. Robert 
  Tilton was praying on TV. I can't explain it, but I heard him say, 'You. Right 
  there. You're smoking a joint.' I dropped the joint and he said, 'You just dropped 
  it.' I started crying. I KNEW IT WAS GOD TALKING TO ME. </font> </p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><img src="t4.jpg" width="85" height="85" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></font>Envelopes 
  from Tilton were colorful inside and out, and plenty thick. They were described 
  as "redemption packets," containing nearly ten back-to-back pages 
  of typed and scribbled notations resembling the discarded napkin doodlings of 
  a mental patient. Sometimes they contained "magic" pennies, cheap 
  metal crosses on neck chains, rubber bands, complimentary stickers or vegetable 
  seeds, packets of salt, lengths of yarn, swatches of carpet samples, even brown 
  grass lawn clippings in plastic sandwich bags. Each was part and parcel of an 
  intimate religious ceremony the recipient could conduct in the privacy of his 
  or her own home.<font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><img src="ring.jpg" width="255" height="406" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></font></p>
<p>"Right now this cloth is plain fabric," one fold-out poster reads. 
  A swiftly scribbled arrow sweeps down the page, pointing to a 2-inch square 
  of nylon-cotton blended silk, Scotch taped to a 3x5 index card. "But after 
  you send it back with a $1000 vow, it will be a <i>Miracle Cloth</i> saturated 
  with the presence of God. <img src="t6.jpg" width="85" height="85" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Open 
  the enclosed package of special oil and anoint the point of your need. Let the 
  Holy Spirit lead you in applying this Miracle Anointing Oil and Miracle Cloth 
  in faith to pictures of your loved ones, to your billfold, to the doorposts 
  of your home, to your body. However he shows you, apply this Miracle Cloth and 
  Anointing Oil in faith for special miracles."</p>
<p>At his peak, Tilton was purchasing 5,000 hours of air time each month. His 
  mass-market ministry pulled in an estimated $80 million per year, and his church 
  drew as many as 5,000 worshippers to Sunday service. Tilton gleaned the donations 
  by pitching a narrow, well-oiled version of the Pentecostal <i>prosperity gospel:</i> 
  in exchange for a $1,000 vow, Tilton promised to lobby God for miraculous <img src="t9.jpg" width="85" height="85" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">improvements 
  to your health and finances. According to one survey, he spent 68 percent of 
  his air time asking for money."If Jesus Christ were alive today and walking 
  around, he wouldn't want his people driving Volkswagens and living in apartments," 
  he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The Trinity Foundation, an aggressive televangelism watchdog group, took notice 
  of Tilton's antics. Armed with a team of private investigators, the Foundation 
  conducted trash sweeps of the dumpsters behind his ministry headquarters, and 
  turned over their findings to Diane Sawyer and ABC Television's <i>PrimeTime 
  Live</i>. ABC broadcast their report in November of 1991, including an interview 
  with a woman who spent two days opening mail for Tilton. She told reporters 
  that she and other workers were instructed to remove any cash, checks, or jewelry 
  from the returned mailers, and throw the prayer requests written to Tilton (caution: 
  spoilers) into the trash can. </p>
<p><img src="t8.jpg" width="85" height="85" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><img src="thief.jpg" width="262" height="331" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">"You're 
  sat down in a cubicle and given a letter opener," she began. "You 
  have bundles and bundles of mail and a trash bin beside you. You slice open 
  the envelope, take the money out and throw the letter away in the bin. You cannot 
  help but read them. All these letters were like, 'Pray for me,' because they 
  were terminal or their son is terminal or there was no money for food. Desperate 
  situations. There would be like $17, and the letter would say, 'I realize I 
  have to give $2 more than I usually give'. You open enough envelopes to generate 
  $1,000 an hour. It was unbelievable, literally unbelievable."</p>
<p><i><img src="t5.jpg" width="85" height="85" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">PrimeTime's</i> 
  ratings, which had been low, improved following the Tilton broadcast. Tilton's 
  ministry suffered measurably from the fallout of videotaped evidence depicting 
  thousands of torn-up prayer requests in Hefty-brand garbage sacks slogged away 
  in the dumpsters.</p>
<p>In April of 1994, Tilton and his ministry were sued successfully for $1.5 million 
  by Vivian Elliott, a woman who suffered from depression relating to childhood 
  abuse. Vivian had attended a barbecue at her parents' house, after which she 
  went home and wrote a <a href="/library/death/suicide/suicide-notes/">suicide note</a> to her husband and children. She drove to 
  a wooded area and contemplated taking her own life, but while sitting in her 
  car, she heard God tell her to return home -- which she did. The next morning, 
  Vivian saw Tilton's Success-N-Life commercial, during which Tilton announced 
  that he felt someone "depressed" was watching, and he instructed this 
  unidentified p<i><img src="tilton.gif" width="313" height="216" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></i>erson 
  to call the Word of Faith prayer line immediately.</p>
<p>Mrs. Elliott felt as though Tilton was speaking directly to her, and that he 
  had been sent by God to reinforce her religious experience from the night before. 
  She called, and in addition to making a large monetary vow, Vivian was eventually 
  persuaded to make a video testimonial for use on Tilton's television program. 
  Although Tilton's representatives later denied any such representation, Mrs. 
  Elliott testified that she was told that any money generated by the use of her 
  testimonial would be used to set up a crisis center to help people who had suffered 
  the same kind of abuse she had.</p>
<p>When Vivian finally saw the edited testimonial, she became very upset. Dramatic 
  recreations meant to depict the type of abuse she suffered as a child had been 
  exaggerated to cartoonish, embarrassing levels -- and despite her calls and 
  letters to Word of Faith asking that the testimonial not be shown, Mrs. Elliott 
  received no response.</p>
<p><img src="story.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The 
  September 30, 1993 edition of the <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> reported that 
  Tilton was finally going off the air, blaming damage done to his ministry by 
  the information brought to light by <i>PrimeTime Live</i>. <img src="box2.gif" width="172" height="333" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">According 
  to the article, "the ABC report alleged that Tilton never prayed personally 
  over each letter as promised, and that a processing company in Tulsa threw out 
  prayer requests after contributions were deposited in the bank." Tilton's 
  lawyer insisted those allegations were incorrect.</p>
<p>Tilton's Word of Faith church was sold to the city of Farmers Branch, Texas, 
  for $6.1 million in 1999. The Branch made plans to convert the 13-acre property 
  into a convention center. Tilton used a portion of the money to settle a million-dollar 
  fraud lawsuit filed by his first wife, Marte, in 1996. </p>
<p>After he and Marte divorced in 1993, Tilton married evangelist and former beauty 
  queen Leigh Valentine. Valentine then turned around and divorced him two years 
  later, citing constant abuse. He would throw her down stairs, slam her against 
  walls, hurl <i><img src="fartingpreacher.jpg" width="128" height="192" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></i>cordless 
  telephones at her head, drink himself into blind rages (often declaring he was 
  the Pope) and wake up in the night screaming that rats were eating his brain. 
  During divorce proceedings, she cited his constant paranoia and "disguise 
  kits" (fake moustaches, $1200 custom-made wigs) which he'd wear frequently 
  during their first year of marriage.</p>
<p>Tilton has since married a Florida woman, Maria Rodriguez. More than ten years 
  after the collapse of his ministry, he's still reaching millions of television 
  viewers from his mailing list -- and several years ago his televised informercials 
  were picked up by Black Entertainment Television. <br>
  <br>
  Since then, he's formed two companies, bought a 50-foot yacht, and nabbed a 
  piece of oceanfront property in Miami Beach valued at $1.3 million. To this 
  day, Tilton is universally recognized as the unwitting star of the "Pastor 
  Gas" or "Farting Preacher" series of underground videotapes -- 
  a montage of scenes from his insane television broadcasts, with funny <a href="/library/medicine/bodily-functions/farting/">fart noises</a> 
  layered into the soundtrack and synchronized with his constipated facial expressions.</p>
