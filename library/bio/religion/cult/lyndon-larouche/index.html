<h1>Lyndon LaRouche</h1>

<blockquote><font size=-1>
The present world financial-monetary system is in the process of disintegration. We're during the last phases of a disintegration. Now, in such matters, you cannot predict the exact time something will happen, because governments may print money, even at risk of hyperinflation, in order to try to postpone a financial collapse for political reasons.
</font></blockquote>
<p>

With major industrial powerhouses like Japan and the United States so deep in the red (not to mention all the peons in the developing world), the global economy teeters on the brink. The International Monetary Fund is doomed to collapse any day now, and when it does the entire system of world credit will suddenly dissolve, gutting country after country like the collapsing tents of a struck circus camp. There will be widespread panic, rioting, and chaos. And when it finally does go down and the missiles start flying, you can bet that wherever he is, Lyndon LaRouche will turn to the guy next to him and say, <i>"Now who's crazy?!"</i>
<p>

Since at least the mid-1970s, LaRouche has been screaming to anybody who'll listen that doomsday is right around the corner.
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
I am not only a life-long lover of science, but have contributed several closely related fundamental scientific discoveries of my own, to the field known as the science of physical economy.
</tt></blockquote>
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
Beginning in the late 1960s, once millions of high school and college age youth had been lured into the drug-rock counterculture -- through such mass media extravaganzas as <a href="/library/culture/beatles/">The Beatles</a> and <a href="/library/culture/rolling-stones/">Rolling Stones</a> appearances on the Ed Sullivan TV show, the Woodstock festival, the Haight-Ashbury "summer of love," the Broadway smash hit rock opera <i>Hair</i> -- the social engineers steering "Operation Satan" began peddling the "sexual revolution" which said that lesbianism and <a href="/library/sex/homosexuality/">homosexuality</a> were "liberating" forms of behavior.
<p>

Put the pieces together. First, the creative capacities of the nation's youth -- truly their most precious possession -- are destroyed by drugs. Next, the sexual identities of millions of Americans are thrown topsy turvy by a culture that extols the virtues of homosexuality. And finally, <a href="/library/religion/satanism/">Satanism</a>, the worship of Evil, emerges as a new religion.
</tt></blockquote>
<center>-- 1989 pamphlet "Is Satan in Your Schoolyard?"</center>
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
As trends in popular culture, so called, plunged downward, during the recent thirty-five years, the almost brainless irrationalism of the lowest of the low-church types, the most human-cattle-like types, spread and worsened. The result of that has been the reaction-formation in which our nation's life is polluted, more and more, by those religious and kindred expressions of anti-cognitive irrationalism typified by the lowest of the low-church cults, such as those of Rev. <a href="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/pat-robertson/">Pat Robertson</a> and Rev. <a href="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/jerry-falwell/">Jerry Falwell</a>. This trend is complemented by the soaring incidence of mental disorders within the population as a whole.
<p>

The result is, inevitably, both the spread of pseudo-Christian cults, echoing the Flagellant hordes of Europe's Fourteenth Century, and a growing hostility to everything rational in science and culture generally. The result has been, as in the moral and intellectual degeneration of Eighteenth-Century England under the House of Hanover, the transformation of a large and growing ration of our population into "Yahoos."

Antisemitic ultraconservative British-hating nutball.
<p>

LaRouche lives on a heavily guarded estate near Leesburg in rural Loudoun County. 
<p>

Conscientious objector in <a href="/library/history/war/wwii/">World War II</a>.
<p>

Some former members speak fondly of these days of leftist fervor, because they said things started changing in mid-1972. That is when LaRouche split up with his common-law wife, who then moved to England to marry an English follower of LaRouche's, according to ex-members and published reports.
<p>

In December of [1973], LaRouche announced in a dramatic New York speech to members that Christopher White, the British associate who had married LaRouche's former common-law wife, had been kidnapped and then released by the <a href="/library/conspiracy/cia/">CIA</a> and the Soviet secret police, according to ex-members, published reports and the group's literature.

LaRouche said that agents had brainwashed White, then 26, with drugs and electric shock treatment and by forcing him to eat his own excrement. The agents then programmed White to set up LaRouche's murder by a hit squad, LaRouche said. He also told members they were all in danger of being murdered by the CIA, and that some of them had also been brainwashed.
<p>

"Your parents are immoral," the group's members were told in an internal bulletin several years later. "The people of the United States are not morally fit to survive... Everything your parents say is evil -- they are like lepers, morally and intellectually insane."

Some of LaRouche's past proposals have included a quarantine of <a href="/library/medicine/epidemics/aids/">AIDS</a> victims and the colonization of Mars. He has charged that <a href="/library/bio/royalty/britain/queen-elizabeth-ii/">Queen Elizabeth II</a> is a drug dealer, and that <a href="/library/bio/usa/henry-kissinger/">Henry Kissinger</a> and Walter Mondale are Soviet agents.
<p>


LaRouche speech of January 3, 1974:

<blockquote>
"How do you brainwash somebody? Well, first of all, you generally pull a psychological profile or develop one in a preliminary period. You find every vulnerability of that person from a psychoanalytic standpoint. Now the next thing you do is you build them up for fear in males and females of homosexuality, aim them for an anal identification with anal sex, their mouth is identified with fellatio. Their mouth is identified only with the penis -- that kind of sex, and with woman. Womanhood is the fellatio of the male mouth in a man who has been brainwashed by the KGB; that is sucking penises. . . ."
<p>

"First they say your father was nothing, your father was a queer, your father was a woman. They play very strongly on homosexual fears. It doesn't work on women... Most women are to a large degree homosexual in this society. The relationship between daughter and mother is homosexual, so the thing is not much of a threat."
<p>

"But to young men it is generally a grave threat... fears about masturbation... They say, 'See that sheep. Wouldn't you like to do that to a sheep?'"
<p>

"It's not the pain that brainwashes, it's forcing the victim to run away from the pain by taking the bait of degrading himself. This persistant pattern of self-degradation, self-humiliation, is what essentially accomplishes the brainwashing."
<p>

"Any of you who say this is a hoax -- you're cruds! You're subhuman! You're not serious. The human race is at stake. Either we win or there is no humanity. That's the way she's cut."
</blockquote>
<p>


Misc:
<p>

<blockquote>In a 1978 article in the NCLC
publication New Solidarity, LaRouche wrote, "Israel is ruled from
London as a zombie-nation" and that Zionism is "the state of
selective psychosis through which London manipulates most of the
international Jewry." In describing Zionism as "a hideous cult,"
LaRouche went on to allege that the Nazis "only" killed "about a
million and a half" Jews and asserted that Hitler had been put into
power largely with the backing of certain Jewish financial interests.
<p>

A November 1997 article in the organization's journal, The New Federalist, claimed that the 'British got rid of Rabin -- shot to death two years ago today -- and brought in Netanyahu, whose assignment has been to return the region to a state of war... Netanyahu is gunning for nuclear war [but in] order to carry out this British game plan... [he] must first purge several leading figures in the intelligence and military establishment who consider such a war suicidal'.
<p>

Finally, LaRouche declared that there was "a hard kernel of truth" in <a href="/library/hoaxes/zion-protocols/">The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>, a notorious anti-Semitic forgery promulgated at the turn of the century by the Czarist secret police.
