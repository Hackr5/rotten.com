Failed monkey salesman.
<p>

Despite his sociopathy, one must give Jim Jones mad props for loyalty and people management skills. First, he transforms his seemingly mainstream <a href="/library/travel/cities/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a> congregation into a full-blown religious cult. Next he convinces the government of Guyana to give him 300 acres of South American jungle, and relocates 1,100 cult members to this distant hellhole. Finally, in 1978 after it all goes horribly wrong, Jones still manages to convince 900 of them to swallow poison in massively parallel <a href="/library/death/suicide/famous/">suicide</a>, the likes of which the world had never seen.
<p>

Arrested in a <a href="/library/sex/homosexuality/cruisy-restrooms/">cruisy restroom</a> in Los Angeles.
<p>
 
By the way, it wasn't Kool-Aid. It was <a href="http://www.jelsert.com/products/flavoraid.htm" target="_blank">Flavor Aid</a>®. Different company altogether.
