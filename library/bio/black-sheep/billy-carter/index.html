<h1>Billy Carter</h1>

<blockquote>
I do not approve of the fact that my brother has gotten involved in a controversial relationship with an extremely unpopular government. He has, still, certain legal and Constitutional rights. If he is found to have violated the law, my belief is -- and my hope is -- that he will be treated properly, in accordance with the law: punished if he's guilty, exonerated if he's innocent. But I have seen these things sweep across this nation every now and then, with highly-publicized allegations that prove <i>not</i> to be true, and you and others have participated in the raising of these questions.<br>
<center>-- President <a href="/library/bio/presidents/jimmy-carter/">Jimmy Carter</a>, August 4, 1980</center>
