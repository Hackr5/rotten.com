<h1>John E. du Pont</h1>

Great-great grandson of E.I. du Pont, John E. du Pont possesses a net worth probably around $250M. A trained ornithologist, du Pont discovered and named two dozen new species of birds and wrote numerous articles of scholarship on the subject.
<p>

He is, however, insane. After the death of his mother (with whom he lived most of his first 50 years), Du Pont converted his 800 acre <i>Foxcatcher</i> into a wrestling "training compound", complete with 14,400 square foot training facility costing over half a million dollars. He became the primary benefactor to the sport of amateur wrestling in the entire United States.
<p>

A gun enthusiast, du Pont opened a firing range at <i>Foxcatcher</i>, which he named the <i><a href="/library/bio/usa/j-edgar-hoover/">J. Edgar Hoover</a> Pistol Training Center</i>.
<p>

Du Pont really, umm, liked young male athletes.
<p>

Evidence of gayness is circumstantial but compelling. Wrestling coach Richard Deschatelets: "Nobody would say out in the open that Du Pont's a homosexual, even though that's [what] just about everybody figured out just [by] the way he handled things." Ron Good, editor, <i>Amateur Wrestling News</i>: "I think that Du Pont was most likely a gay person, and he certainly would make attempts to do whatever he wanted to do with the wrestlers that he had in there." 
<p>

Former employee Andy Metzger sued du Pont for $555k, claiming the millionaire had made homosexual advances at him, and then was subsequently fired. The suit was settled out of court, though it is not known if Metzger took up du Pont's offer of a wrestling match to determine the outcome.
<p>

Du Pont perfected an (illegal) wrestling move, the <i>Foxcatcher Five</i>, in which the opponent's testicles are cupped not-so-gently. He particularly enjoyed using the innovative move on the Foxcatcher newbies.
<p>

We don't know why, but Du Pont shot Olympic wrestler David Schultz as the wrestler was fixing his car radio. The exchange went something like this:

<blockquote>
<tt>Schultz:</tt> "Hey Coach."<br>
<tt>Du Pont:</tt> "You got a problem with me?"<br>
Du Pont shoots Schultz in the arm.<br>
Du Pont shoots Schultz in the chest. Schultz's wife peeks out the door.<br>
Du Pont delivers the coup de grace with another shot to the chest.<br>
</blockquote>

A two day police standoff followed, SWAT teams biding their time under the assumption that madman du Pont possessed an arsenal. During trial, the defense claimed du Pont "fell into the abyss of insanity." A jury found him guilty of third degree murder, and the state of Delaware forced du Pont to pay $742,107 reimbursement for the trial.
