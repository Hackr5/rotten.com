<h1>Paris Hilton</h1>

<p> What do you get the socialite hotel chain heiress who has everything? How 
  about a big, stupid cock in her pudgy little butterface? The <b>Paris Hilton</b> 
  sex tape of 2003 was little more than your standard three-pronged fuck 'n' suck: 
  missionary, doggy-style and a blowjob. The entire feature weighs in at a scant 
  two minutes and fifty-sex seconds, operating in near dismal conformity with 
  Lars von Trier's <i>Dogma</i> treatise on moment-by-moment filmmaking. The handheld 
  camera is unmistakably "on location," there is no superficial action 
  or geographical alienation, all sound effects are produced in real-time collaboration 
  with the images, and the primary director disavowed any immediate accreditation.</p>
<p>The tape has been seen, screened, and lampooned on <a href="/library/culture/daily-show/">The Daily Show</a> and 
  <a href="/library/culture/snl/">Saturday Night Live</a> -- but even to this day, more people have actually 
  sat down to watch her insipid Fox series <i>The Simple Life</i> than the sex 
  tape itself. The actual reasons for this upsidedown ratio are beyond the scope 
  of this article, and must remain unexplored. But here's a girl who's chosen 
  to spend her allowance on ways that <i>don't</i> benefit mankind, that <i>don't</i> 
  create appealing business ventures or accomplish anything constructive. <img src="tits.jpg" width="300" height="367" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Gone 
  are the days where being a student of the "upper class" meant facilitating 
  a lifestyle meant to be envied or emulated by others. Instead, the world is 
  watching Paris insinuate her noisy, shopworn caboose into just about every <i><b>unnecessary</b></i> 
  public venue conceivable: modeling, acting, singing, television, fashion, jewelry, 
  and amateur pornography. While she spreads herself thinner than the flimsy premise 
  of her television program ("let's laugh at the poor people by pretending 
  they're too icky to touch") Paris's porno bid contains no more extracurricular 
  puss-puss than what she flashes at the paparazzi on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The only thing <i>unusual</i> about the Paris Hilton sex tape is that looks 
  like it was shot at the Motel 6 in Shitsville, New Mexico. It's a straight-to-video 
  public relations ploy which raises neither controversial questions nor spontaneous 
  erections. Paris appears sober and compliant throughout, although her family 
  claims she may have been drugged.</p>
<p><img src="ppussy2.jpg" width="206" height="317" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">When 
  the "scandal" broke, it quickly came to light that Paris's porn director 
  and co-star was none other than Richard Salomon, an independent movie producer 
  and online gambling entrepreneur. He's also the ex-boyfriend of Devon Aoki (model 
  and heiress to the <i>Benihana</i> restaurant fortune) and estranged husband 
  of <i>Charmed</i> actress Shannen Doherty. At first glance, the Sony Digicam 
  infrared nightvision green makes Salomon look as though he wields an ample, 
  larger-than-life dick, until you realize Paris's hands are abnormally waifish 

  in size and shape, like those of Cruella DeVille. Salomon's cock has since been 
  described as "nothing to write home about." When rumors of the tape 
  first surfaced, Hilton denied its existence, calling Salomon "a complete 
  liar and scumbag" in New York magazine, but she was later forced to backpedal 
  after it become obvious the video was real.</p>
<p>As suddenly as the tape begins, it screeches to a close. Paris dispenses less 
  than twenty seconds of below-average blowjobbery, much of which is technically 
  incompetent and more artistically bankrupt than Pamela Anderson's half-hearted 
  performance upon Tommy Lee. Paris's hand remains indignantly clamped around 
  Salomon's Viagra-induced erection, her lips flail (but fail) to fellate more 
  than an inch beyond the tip of his dick. She licks it stupidly, like a home-grown 
  amateur creampuff staring off into empty space as the camera fades mercifully 
  to black. There is no happy finish, no climax, no splashy ejaculatory parade 
  against her face, into her hair or down her neck.</p>

<p><img src="paris-hilton-video.jpg" width="288" height="188" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Richard 
  Salomon has filed a $10 million slander lawsuit against Hilton, asserting that 
  she was in fact an active participant in making the video, alleging that the 
  Hilton family has waged a "cold, calculated and malicious campaign to portray 
  Salomon as a rapist." Hilton's lawyers are threatening legal action against 
  anyone who distributes the tape or fails to destroy their copy of it, but purported 
  snippets have been offered on eBay. Meanwhile, at high-class parties in New 
  York, Las Vegas and Los Angeles, Paris Hilton remains the target of a very specific 
  socialite indulgence. It's a game called <b>Dump Your Drink On Paris</b>, the 
  object of which is to spot Paris at a party, "trip" next to her and 
  splash the full contents of your Cape Cod across her expensive evening gown. 
  The lighter the color of her fabric, and the darker the indelible fruit juice 
  of your drink, the better. If ice cubes go down the back of her dress, you score 
  double.</p>
<p>"The Hilton family is greatly saddened at how low human beings will stoop 
  to exploit their daughter, Paris, who is sweet-natured, for their own self-promotion 
  as well as profit motives," read a statement released by the family. Funny 
  how Paris Hilton's sister Nicky no longer seems interested in courting the public. 
  Where'd she get off to, anyway?</p>
<p>Shot by shot: here's a distilled, tastefully blacked-out breakdown of the video, 
  partially censored by only the finest <a href="http://www.rottenstore.com/">Rotten 
  Dot Com stickers</a> being manufactured to date. We start from frame 00:00:00:00 
  and end with frame 00:02:56:00. The following display is meant merely to edutain, 
  infotate, and encourage the avoidance of unpleasant legal action items. There 
  are two other central characters in this video: cellular telephone caller "Fred," 
  and a pay-per-view television program which remains audible throughout the entire 
  romp. Your reaction will likely fall somewhere between a yawn and a dismissive 
  sigh. <b>This</b> is what <i>E! Entertainment News</i> calls a scandal?</p>
