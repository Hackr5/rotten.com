<h1>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</h1>

<p><b>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</b> (Aug. 28, 1749 - Mar. 22, 1832)<br>
        <br>
       <p><i>"The world is for thousands a freak show; the images flicker past and 
        vanish; the impressions remain flat and unconnected in the soul. Thus 
        they are easily led by the opinions of others, are content to let their 
        impressions be shuffled, rearranged, and evaluated differently."</i><br>

        author <b>J.W. Goethe's</b> last name is pronounced <i>Gaer-tah</i>, and 
        he's generally recognized as one of the greatest and most versatile European 
        thinkers of modern times. He was an <i>extremely</i> sensitive, vulnerable 
        individual who left behind a detailed record of his daily struggle with 
        human emotions. It's difficult to categorize him exactly; he was at once 
        a writer, a philosopher; and (of all things) a scientist of plant biology 
        and optics.<br>
        <br>
        As a boy, Goethe was rather precocious. He'd learned Greek, Latin, French 
        and Italian by age eight. He'd acquired from his mother a knack for storytelling; 
        and he liked staging miniature puppet shows in his nursery.<br>
        <br>
        The best known of Goethe's works is <b>Faust</b>, written over the course 
        of <i>fifty seven years</i> and finally published when he was 81. It's 
        a simple morality tale, illustrating the punishment of sin and the inherent 
        drama of redemption. </p>
      <p>He was also the leader of the German <b>Romantic</b> movement which profoundly 
        influenced the growth of sonnets, romanticism, lyrical poetry, and love 
        notes. He allowed women to fully shape his career, and his work thrived 
        on their input. He wrote <i>Moral-sensuous</i> erotic librettos with remarkable 
        elegance, enabling sixteen year olds to fall in love with him at the drop 
        of a bonnet, even while he was in his late seventies. Goethe met, in his 
        lifetime, an enviable collection of naive, middle-class girls who found 
        themselves in that precious phase of &quot;waiting&quot; for that one 
        special male who could trigger their dormant passions.</p>

<p><b>The Quotable Goethe:</b>
      <p><i>The true, prescriptive artist strives after artistic truth; the lawless 
        artist, following blind instinct, after an appearance of naturalness. 
        The one leads to the highest peaks of art, the other to its lowest depths. 
        </i>
      <p><i> One of the most striking signs of the decay of art is when we see 
        its separate forms jumbled together. </i>
      <p><i> One ought, every day at least, to hear a little song, read a good 
        poem, see a fine picture, and, if it were possible, to speak a few reasonable 
        words. </i>
      <p><i> Man knows only when he is satisfied and when he suffers, and only 
        his sufferings and his satisfactions instruct him concerning himself, 
        teach him what to seek and what to avoid. For the rest, man is a confused 
        creature; he knows not whence he comes or whither he goes, he knows little 
        of the world, and above all, he knows little of himself. <br>
        <br>
        Certain flaws are necessary for the whole. It would seem strange if old 
        friends lacked certain quirks.</i>
      <p><i> N</i><i>o two men see the world exactly alike, and different temperaments 
        will apply in different ways a principle that they both acknowledge. The 
        same man will, indeed, often see and judge the same things differently 
        on different occasions: early convictions must give way to more mature 
        ones. Nevertheless, may not the opinions that a man holds and expresses 
        withstand all trials, if he only remains true to himself and others? </i>
      <p><i> He who has a task to perform must know how to take sides, or he is 
        quite unworthy of it. </i>
      </p>
