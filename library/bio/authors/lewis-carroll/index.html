<h1>Lewis Carroll</h1>

Lewis loved making friends with young girls. He'd write to them, more often
than not employing them in vague, abstract ways to serve as his muse.
This "girl habit" flourished to include taking nude photographs of them,
though interestingly enough never without their parents present. But when
Carroll's gal pals reached a certain age, they were discarded. He would
simply stop writing them letters, enlisting their services,
or caring about their opinions.
<p>

Carroll made a habit of carrying safety pins with him on trips to the beach, in case he met any nice little girls who wanted to walk through the surf but couldn't manage it without getting their dress damp.
