<h1>Doug Henning</h1>
<p><b>Doug Henning</b> (May 3, 1947 - February 7, 2000)</p>
<p><img src="/library/occult/magic/magicians/doug-henning/10044040.jpg" height="397" width="319" align="left"> Douglas James 
  Henning, the world's premiere disco hippie magician. His most astonishing trick 
  ever was convincing the Canadian government to fork over grant money so he could 
  revive magic tricks within a focused, theatrical venue. A teenager in the sixties, 
  Henning was far too young to perform in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>He took the money and promptly fled Canada. After moving to Los Angeles, he 
  put together <i>The Magic Show</i>. It opened on Broadway and ran for over <b>four 
  years</b>. The show combined rainbows, rock music, elaborate sets, flashy illusions, 
  and inappropriately homosexual costumes. He choreographed magical effects for 
  The Jacksons, appeared on <i>The Tonight Show</i>, and performed at the White 
  House. Each of Henning's fingers was insured for $300,000 apiece.</p>
<p>This was during a period in American history when traditional "magicians" 
  as a collective group were going through extremely lean times, working occasional 
  nightclub acts or sandwiched between comedians and accordion players.</p>
<p><i>The Magic Show</i> was translated into an annual TV spectacular, <i>The 
  World of Magic</i>. Millions of viewers tuned in to watch Henning make elephants 
  disappear, or transform beautiful women into Michael Landon. In one unscripted 
  moment, a Bengal tiger escaped backstage and chased talk show host Tom Snyder 
  into the men's toilet.</p>
<p><img src="pic4.JPG" width="200" height="243" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right">Straight-laced 
  American viewers grew concerned when each and every episode of <i>The World 
  of Magic</i> ended with an identical intonation delivered by Henning: <i>"Anything 
  the mind can conceive is possible. Nothing is impossible. All you have to do 
  is look within and you can realize your fondest dreams. I would like to wish 
  each one of you all of life's wonders and a joyful age of enlightenment."</i></p>
<p><img src="/library/occult/magic/magicians/doug-henning/henning1.jpg" height="141" width="160" width="160" height="141" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="left"> This 
  hackneyed signoff was all part of Henning's master plan. He was deeply committed 
  to Transcendental Meditation, the seventies equivalent of yoga or Pilates. He 
  sold his magic props, auctioned off his costumes, and traveled to India to "study" 
  with the <a href="/library/bio/religion/cult/maharishi/">Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</a>. In 1994, he returned to Canada in and ran for 
  parliament as a candidate of the Natural Law Party.</p>
<p>His platform included employing 10,000 flying yogis who would meditate to cure 
  Canada's problems. They would create a "unified field," as part of 
  the "Maharishi effect" - something he claimed was responsible for 
  bringing down the Berlin Wall, helping stock markets to rise, and cutting the 
  crime rate. He stated, "If I can make an elephant disappear, I can make 
  the deficit disappear."</p>
<p><img src="bw.jpg" width="238" height="308" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right">Henning's 
  bid for office earned 839 votes out of a total of 55,298 cast.</p>
<p>Increasingly branded a kook in the world press, Henning focused his efforts 
  at opening a theme park called <i>Veda Land</i>, a possible joint effort between 
  the Henning empire and <a href="/library/crime/corporate/disney/">Disney</a>.</p>
<p>It would a $1.5 billion project, to be located in one of three places: (a) 
  the Canadian wilderness, (b) Niagara Falls, or (c) the middle of Iowa. Comparisons 
  to <a href="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/jim-bakker/">Jim Bakker</a>'s failed Christian theme park Heritage USA were drawn, to 
  which Henning responded, "No - it's more like - wow, isn't enlightenment 
  great?"</p>
<p>Henning died of liver cancer at age 52.</p>
