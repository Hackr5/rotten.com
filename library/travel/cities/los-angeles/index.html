<h1>Los Angeles, CA</h1>

L.A.'s contribution to American culture is basically impossible to overestimate. To begin with, it's the home of <a href="/library/travel/disneyland/">Disneyland</a> and the original birthplace of <a href="/library/crime/corporate/mcdonalds/">McDonald's</a>. It's also the epicenter for the conjoined entertainment factories in Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley. And it's also the home of <a href="/library/religion/scientology/">Scientology</a> headquarters.
<p>

People commonly believe that L.A.'s rival is <a href="/library/travel/cities/nyc/">New York City</a>, but that's just a product of America's preoccupation with its own bicoastalism. Angelenos know that their true antagonist is <a href="/library/travel/cities/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a>.
