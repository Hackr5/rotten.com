<td valign=top><font size=-1>John Geoghan is ordained as a priest (Blessed Sacrament, Saugus, MA), and commences a joyous streak of raping over 150 boys for the next 33 years. During this time he is bounced between parishes in Saugus, Concord, Hingham, Jamaica Plain, Dorchester, and Weston. At nearly every parish, he is accused of raping boys, and in every case of accusation the Boston Archdiocese proceeds to move Geoghan to another Parish. At various times, the touchy-feely father is given therapy or counseling, but it apparently doesn't "take". Geoghan is defrocked in 1998, is later sent to prison for a single proved crime (many of the cases have gone past the Statute of Limitations) and is ultimately strangled in prison. </font></td>

He provides a vague description of the gunman, a black man in a jogging suit. The Boston Police get right on it and start rounding up every black man for a very large radius in anything resembling a jogging suit. A suspect, Willie Bennett, is found, and is close to conviction when it comes to light that Stuart had shot his wife and himself to claim a million-dollar insurance policy (his brother, an accomplice, rats him out). His infant son, delivered by cesarian section from his dying wife, had lived just 17 days. When fingers suddenly point away from Bennett to the husband, Charles Stuart commits <a href="/library/death/suicide/">suicide</a> off a 25-story bridge in Charlestown. Willie Bennett is quietly released and all charges are dropped. A lot of blacks in Boston are still very pissed about this whole affair.</font></td>

The repeal had been signed into law in November of 2003 as part of a general Job Creation package. In actuality, the ban had previously been lifted in all towns within 10 miles of other states (for competition purposes) and before certain holidays. Astoundingly, this decision is not just controversial, but decisively so, framed as a general breakdown of respect for the Sabbath and for family values.
