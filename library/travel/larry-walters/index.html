<h1>Larry Walters</h1>

As we go through childhood, several notions tend to strike all of us at one time or another. <i>If I swing hard enough, can I actually go over the top of the swingset? If I start digging right now, can I have an underground fortress before dinner? If I mix the stuff in this magical collection underneath this sink, can I make a drink that turns me a superhero?</i>
<p>
As we grow older, these little notions fade away, or we try them once and become one of those really sad funerals where the mayor shows up. 
<p>
One man, however, dared to ask the question that many would have forgotten with the onset of structured education: <i>If I attached enough balloons to a chair, could I fly?</i> 
<p>
And even more amazing, the answer was <i>yes</i>.
