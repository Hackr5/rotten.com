<h1>Insult</h1>
Nobody likes to recieve an insult, and in fact very few people intentionally give them on a regular basis; the problem is that it is so <I>easy</i> to insult some people. History has thousands of occasions where little disagreements over what's appropriate explode into battles that rage on for decades.
<P>
As the story goes, the famous Hatfield-McCoy feud that lasted for generations began when a pig wandered into the wrong property.
