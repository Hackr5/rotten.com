<h1>TGN1412</h1>

<p>Multiple sclerosis is a chronic degenerative disease of the central nervous
  system -- the most common neurological disease which claims the lives and livelihoods
  of young adults. Being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis is a frightening
  and devastating experience which threatens to disrupt people's lives
  in  unpredictable ways. MS can invoke a range of feelings
  from disbelief and resentment, to absolute panic. Enormous pressures bear down
  on the families of MS victims -- who often have
  no choice but to become full-time care givers.</p>
<p>In March of 2006, <b><i>TGN1412</i></b> attempted to change all that. It appeared
  to be a new treatment for the devastating illnesses of leukemia, rheumatoid
  arthritis and multiple sclerosis. The medicine was developed by TeGenero --
  a biopharmaceutical company headquartered Würzburg,
  Germany -- staffed by scientists dedicated to the identification and development
of innovative, broadly applicable immunotheraputics. </p>
<p><img src="bh_stewie.jpg" width="174" height="186" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >The formula was categorized as a <i>SuperMAB,</i> a unique class of Superantagonistic
  Monoclonal Antibodies, a proprietary antibody trademarked and patented by Tegenero.
  TGN1412 stimulated the generation of <i>T lymphocytes,</i> which serve as key
  regulators of immune responses in laboratory animals and humans. In short,
  it was touted as medicine capable of balancing the immune systems of those
  who suffer from diseases associated with <b>life-threatening
  abnormalities.</b> TGN1412 would quickly become synonymous with "big heads". </p>
<p><img src="bh_katz.jpg" width="213" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >For
  normal-headed, TGN1412-free comedian Jonathan Katz <i>(Dr. Katz, Professional
  Therapist)</i> MS
  symptoms began in 1996. "I was working on a TV show called <i>Ink</i> with
  <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/ted-danson/">Ted Danson</a>, and after every episode we would take a curtain call and I noticed
  that I needed a head-start. I had a spinal tap, which didn't hurt. I had an
  MRI, where they put you in a tube [for] 45 minutes, and I actually enjoyed
the privacy."</p>
<p>TGN1412, also known as <i>CD28,</i> contains a highly unusual property for
  an antibody medicine: instead of blocking a cell's reaction, it causes a stimulation.
  For this reason, even a small dose might provoke a cascading, catastrophic
  calamity. Antibodies stay in the body for months. They can't easily be removed,
  even through multiple blood transfusions. Experimental drugs are typically
  tested on laboratory tissue samples or animals before they're considered "safe
  enough" to
  be injected into humans. TGN1422, on the other hand, was monoclonal antibody,
  designed to target a specifically humanoid protein.</p>
<p>The
  drug was administered with a technique called <i>microdosing.</i> First,
  a <b>blister</b> is created on the patient's arm -- usually with a light, subsurface
  pinprick, briefly applied heat, or mild radiation.<img src="bh_xray.jpg" width="358" height="305" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" > This affords the patient
  limited, localized exposure to the therapy. The blister fills with inflammatory
  fluid, containing cells whose reaction to the drug can be monitored.</p>
<p>Eight human test subjects volunteered to participate in a series of TGN1412
  experiments, and each received compensation worth roughly $3,500 for their
  time, trouble, and risk.</p>
<p>Within minutes of being given the first dose, the patients began suffering
  symptoms which led to vomiting and intense pain. They'd been cautioned that
  there might be some glandular swelling. Some were reported to be "screaming
  that they felt as if their heads were about to explode". Rising to the occasion,
  TGN1412 afforded witnesses a disturbing visual: the severe <b>ballooning
  up</b>  of the heads of each participant. All six men immediately lapsed into
  comas. Doctors battled to save the men by giving them sequential blood transfusions
  and large amounts of fluids. The two volunteers who had received placebos acknowledged
  they "went down like dominoes". </p>
<p>"They just all went down like flies, all six of them," said Myfanwy
  Marshall, girlfriend of one of the victims. Her partner,  Mohammed Abdalla,
  age 28 --<img src="bh_plush.jpg" width="383" height="268" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" > a bar manager in London who volunteered for the experimental therapy
  primarily for the money. Abdalla planned to send the money to his family in
  Egypt to take pay off debts, care for his ill mother and set up a business
  for a sibling.</p>
<p>"He did say that he was planning to come to Egypt in the summer with
  a big surprise for his younger brother Mahmood that he hoped would set him
  up financially for life. It is so tragic if that is why he is in the situation
  he is in now," an Egyptian friend of Abdalla said.</p>
<p align="left">After Marshall visited her boyfriend in the hospital, she emerged
  sobbing and visibly distressed. "They
  can't give us a cure, they're talking to experts. The doctors were on the phone
  to experts all night, asking what they can do. They've said to us 'we're in
  the dark -- we don't know what to do. We don't know this drug. He's young,
  gorgeous, hunky -- he's like a stud -- he's dark and gorgeous and I walked
  in and he's looking puffed out like the <a href="/library/sideshow/elephant-man/">Elephant Man</a> and he looks like a 45-year-old.
  They've just basically killed him within a day -- with one injection, a lethal
  injection."</p>
<p><img src="bh_lynch.jpg" width="330" height="318" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left"> But what is even more
  tragic is the fact that the drug company was aware of this side effect. It has emerged
  that monkeys who were tested developed swollen necks after the trials, but
  the company went ahead with human trials.</p>
<p>Northwick Park intensive care clinical director Ganesh Suntharalingam
  tried to assuage the ruffled feathers of those congregated. "These
  patients sometimes need a lot of fluid, and one result of that is severe but
  temporary swelling. This is distressing for relatives to see, but it does go
  away on recovery and it has no long-term effects."</p>
<p>Richard Ley, spokesman for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry,
said he'd never heard of anything like it before. "This is an absolutely
exceptional occurrence. I cannot remember anything comparable."</p>
<p>According to <i>The Register,</i> Medical Research Council Technology chief
  executive Roberto Solari confided that instead
  of switching on the regulators, "we have switched on the activators and super-induced
  the immune system."</p>
<p>From the <i>Associated Press:</i> "The idea you give six people an injection
  at the same time is unusual," says Kate Law, head of clinical trials for
  Cancer Research UK -- Britain's largest cancer charity. "In any of our
tests, we never test drugs on the volunteers all at the same time."</p>
<p><img src="bh_2guys.jpg" width="396" height="300" align="right" >Since 1997, ten families of international patent applications concerning
  the generation of TeGenero's <i>SuperMAB</i> (including their mode of action,
  therapeutic application, composition and technological innovation) 
  have been filed. In its Intellectual Property Statement, TeGenero announces
  that it will continue to claim intellectual property rights over inventions
  related to SuperMAB® technology
and its application.</p>
<p>The medical research company responsible for the TGN1412 drug trial, <i>Parexel,</i> insisted
it had followed correct procedures. Professor
  Johannes Loewer, president of the Paul Ehrich Institute (which monitored the
  research) said, "There were adverse effects
in certain doses. Some of the monkeys developed an increase in the lymph nodes.
  No monkeys died to our knowledge." During the animal trials, the reaction was
  considered serious enough by TeGenero officials to order the monitoring of
  the human volunteers’ immune
  systems.</p>
<p>It can take a full decade for a drug to enter the human-trial stage -- and
  a tremendous cost. A Health Select Committee quoted the price of that process,
somewhere around $897 million. </p>
<p>TeGenero Immunopharmaceuticals was founded in June of 2000. Since then, they've
  raised more than $17 million in venture backing from investors
  like HBM BioVentures, BioM Venture Capital GmbH & Co Fonds KG and
  BioM AG. As of February 2006, the company had a staff of fifteen -- hardly
  justification for getting a swelled head. </p>
