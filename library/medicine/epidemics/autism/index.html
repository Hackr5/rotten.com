<p><i><img src="loser.jpg" width="328" height="400" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><b>Names 
  in this article</b> have been changed to protect the identities of patients, 
  parents, and healthcare professionals who wish to remain anonymous.</i></p>
<h1>Autism</h1>
<p>Dr. Molly McButter, Ph.D., is a much sought-after child psychologist 
  working near Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. For the past several 
  years, she's been counseling a suspiciously large number of well-to-do (but 
  freaked out) moms and dads living in the Bay Area. They come to her from different 
  cities and unique socioeconomic backgrounds, but they do have one thing in common: 
  their kids have all started <i>acting funny.</i></p>
<p>"Tommy," age two and a half, suddenly stopped recognizing his parents 
  and 5-year-old sister. Instead of responding when called to, he'd sway back 
  and forth in slow circles, pausing only to bonk his head repeatedly against 
  a ceramic dog bowl. One day he ceased making eye contact with his family members 
  altogether. He'd drag his head across the floor, walk on his toes, make odd 
  gurgling sounds, and spend long hours filling and emptying buckets of sand in 
  the sandbox. Then the screaming began; he'd wail inconsolably at all hours of 
  the day and night, refusing to be held or comforted in any way. Shortly thereafter, 
  he developed chronic diarrhea. Tommy's mother compared this incomprehensible 
  phenomenon to someone coming into her perfectly healthy son's bedroom in the 
  night, stealing his personality and ability to communicate, and then leaving 
  behind the empty cardboard box of an utterly bewildered child. </p>
<p><img src="diapers.jpg" width="200" height="348" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">At 
  age six, "Kelly" developed some eccentric habits of her own. She began 
  tugging uncomfortably at the collar of her shirt or the footpads of her pajama 
  bottoms. Sometimes she'd go as far as to rip <i>all</i> her clothes off during 
  an otherwise routine trip to Safeway. At the corner Blockbuster, Kelly would 
  windmill both of her arms and run sweeping down the aisle, knocking entire racks 
  of video boxes onto the floor. When this caused a scene, she too would scream 
  and lash out with her fists, biting her father and lifting up her shirt to bare 
  her bee-stung breasts at flabbergasted customers. At home, she'd refuse to sleep 
  more than a few minutes at a time. She began urinating in the fireplace and 
  all four corners of the hardwood family room floor, making an exaggerated show 
  of it whenever company came over for extended periods of time -- to the understandable 
  consternation and embarrassment of her parents.</p>
<p><img src="rt.jpg" width="200" height="228" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">And 
  when "Harrison" reached the age of ten, his mother and father could 
  no longer deny the disparity between his development and that of other children 
  his age. He seemed to exist alternately in one of two possible states: passed 
  out and sound asleep, or running tirelessly around the house from room to room 
  wearing different wigs and clanging iron pots together. He developed an obsessive, 
  breakfast time fascination with the Pocahontas-style illustration of the Indian 
  princess on the Land O'Lakes spreadable butter tub. He would kick chairs, curse 
  and shriek, and throw forks whenever it was time for her to return to the refrigerator. 
  On his birthday, Harrison crept into his father's room as he lay sleeping, and 
  stabbed him in the buttocks with a turkey thermometer.</p>
<p>After a battery of tests, these children were diagnosed with varying degrees 
  of <b>autism,</b> and Dr. McButter herself was responsible for delivering the 
  bad news. She knows firsthand that the medical and psychiatric literature covering 
  autism employs daunting words like "hopeless" and disparaging phrases 
  like "no known treatment". Autism is a disorder which can seize upon 
  someone instantly, or sneak up on them over the course of many months. It hinders 
  the development of a person's ability to communicate, interact with other people 
  and maintain normal contact with the outside world. <br>
  <br>
  <img src="a1.gif" width="162" height="580" align="left"><img src="a2.gif" width="162" height="591" align="right">The 
  symptoms of autism are <i>extremely</i> noticeable and can be recognized as 
  early as infancy. In most cases, a perfectly normal child will begin to regress: 
  he or she loses the power of speech, abandons social skills, or gets stuck in 
  infinite loops of obsessive physical activity. Most children completely withdraw 
  into a world all their own.</p>
<p>When parents learn their child is autistic, they describe it as one of the 
  most traumatic, stressful events of their lives. Non-autistic people see autism 
  as an enormous tragedy, and mothers and fathers alike experience continuing 
  disappointment and grief at nearly all stages of an autistic child's life. Mostly 
  this grief stems from profound sorrow over the loss of the "normal" 
  child they'd been hoping for.</p>
<p>In forty-eight states, <i>one out of every 500</i> children has been diagnosed 
  with autism. But two regions in the two remaining states -- the California Bay 
  Area and a borough of New Jersey -- stand out: the ratio is a disturbing one 
  in 250. Studies of the New Jersey phenomenon suggest contributing factors like 
  environmental toxins and genetic predisposition, but age attributes of the mothers 
  also apply. Teen mothers, as well as women in their thirties or forties are 
  more likely to produce autistic children than a female in her twenties. New 
  theories attempting to reconcile explanations for the Silicon Valley autism 
  phenomenon are more sinister, and they've begun to orbit around moms and dads 
  who <b>met each other online.</b></p>
<p>Before we explore that, let's turn our attention to the animal world for just 
  a moment. Specialized dog factories offering their customers purebred terriers, 
  greyhounds, German shepherds and the like are in the inbreeding business. It's 
  been long understood that any sufficiently advanced mammal species requires 
  a more dynamic population source. From the standpoint of maintaining a genetically 
  healthy stock, limited mating options guarantee progressive genetic degeneration, 
  brittle bones, deafness, heart problems and a substantial loss of vigor. Any 
  one of these disabilities alone can saddle dog owners with the unhappy responsibility 
  of wrangling unhealthy pets. But if you go to the Humane Society and <b>adopt 
  a dog,</b> you're likely to find -- pardon the term -- <img src="gak2.jpg" width="200" height="208" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">a 
  <b>mutt,</b> a mixed breed dog with rich, colorful DNA. These dogs are profoundly 
  smarter, better adjusted to living with humans, and far more loving than their 
  blue blooded cousins.</p>
<p>In large cities, the men and women who hook up in bars get together because 
  they find each other <i>cute</i>. Successful unions between such couples are 
  more likely to produce <i>cute kids</i> with healthy, happy genes. After all, 
  they're the output of parents who ostensibly came together with no <img src="gak.jpg" width="200" height="237" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">similar 
  genetic markers beyond physical appearance. Their offspring are mutts as well, 
  and statistically predisposed to a healthier, happier life. In smaller cities 
  (or rural areas where sexual intercourse is the preferred method of passing 
  time because nobody has a car or a computer to escape the tedium of everyday 
  life) people of similarly limited characteristics mix and mingle in a woefully 
  homogenous petri dish. Such a localized gene pool is tantamount to a single 
  block of low-income housing: there's far less opportunity for the population 
  to enjoy the diversity required to encourage evolution, <img src="gak3.jpg" width="220" height="293" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">and 
  there's a much greater chance of propagating genetic defects.</p>
<p>The Internet as we know it is more of a puddle than a massive, unwieldy universe. 
  Online portals like Orkut, Friendster, Tribe.Net, MySpace, Nerve, and Craigslist 
  which foster the illusion of value by belonging to privatized, incestuous "communities" 
  are inbreeding a new generation of individuals with genetic markings nearly 
  <i>identical</i> to those of autism -- and its lesser cousin <b>Asperger's.</b></p>
<p><img src="santa.jpg" width="200" height="295" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Asperger's 
  syndrome is a Pervasive Development Disorder (PDD) characterized by severe and 
  sustained impairment with social interaction. Adults with Asperger's have trouble 
  feeling empathy for others, especially when it comes to decoding social cues 
  like gestures, facial expressions and body language. Normal communicative behaviors 
  like humor or the emotional nuances of sarcasm, idioms or metaphors are often 
  wholly lost on sufferers of Asperger's. Relationship issues depicted in books, 
  movies, and television programs will not be understood. While their reading 
  recognition skills are excellent, language comprehension remains weak -- and 
  it cannot be assumed that they fully understand what they so fluently read. 
  People with autism and Asperger's can often be <i>egocentric,</i> meaning that 
  in some cases they find it difficult to believe other people actually have their 
  own thoughts, feelings, or opinions of their own.</p>
<p>The pervasiveness of individual thoughts, feelings, and opinions in tech-savvy 
  metropolitan areas (like Silicon Valley) might be cause for alarm. Steve Silberman, 
  a<i> Wired</i> magazine reporter examined the autism phenomenon several years 
  ago, limiting his focus primarily to men and women working in the software industry: 
  "It's a familiar joke that many of the hardcore programmers in IT strongholds 
  like Intel, Adobe, and Silicon Graphics -- coming to work early, leaving late, 
  sucking down Big Gulps in their cubicles while they code for hours -- are residing 
  somewhere in Asperger's domain. Kathryn Stewart, director of the Orion Academy, 
  a high school for high-functioning kids in Moraga, California, calls Asperger's 
  syndrome <i>the engineers' disorder. </i><a href="/library/bio/business/bill-gates/">Bill Gates</a> is regularly diagnosed 
  in the press: His single-minded focus on technical minutiae, rocking motions, 
  and flat tone of <img src="sneeds.jpg" width="220" height="267" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">voice 
  are all suggestive of an adult with some trace of the disorder. In <i>Microserfs</i>, 
  novelist Douglas Coupland observes, 'I think all tech people are slightly autistic.'"</p>
<p>In January of 2001, <a href="/library/crime/corporate/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> became the first major US corporation to 
  offer its employees insurance benefits to cover the cost of behavioral training 
  for their autistic children. But elsewhere, a building army of autistic offspring 
  threatens to bankrupt families, school systems and states nationwide. Federal 
  law <i>mandates</i> that special-needs students be removed from traditional 
  classrooms and stationed inside the portables at the far, far end of the football 
  field where they can receive specialized tutoring. Such a law requires hiring 
  more expensive teachers (those with master's degrees in special education) who 
  wrangle classrooms of five students as opposed to twenty-five. These classrooms 
  also include deaf and blind students, children with head injuries or learning 
  disabilities like dyslexia, severe emotional disorders or bipolar conditions. 
  The alternative to this arrangement is equally expensive: a privatized care 
  facility where you can park your kid in front of construction paper for the 
  day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as more and more women step up to claim their rightful place in 
  online communities by blogging themselves silly, pumping up their perceived 
  street value with mutually fanatical, hyperactive and hug-heavy "testimonials," 
  e-viting one another into their electroclash pilates tribes, staging impromptu 
  stitch-n-bitch knitting circles or hosting day-long Burning Man "decompression" 
  parties, mentally obtuse men and boys who might <b>never</b> have found a compatible 
  female partner suddenly discover they can hurl an iPod out the window and crack 
  one square in the head with increasing accuracy. As long as men and women continue 
  to meet online based exclusively on shared interests, the mental stability of 
  future generations remains in grave peril -- and new technologies will need 
  to be developed to keep them alive.</p>
<p><img src="cubes.jpg" width="521" height="301" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Office 
  furniture, for instance, may need to be ergonomically redesigned to take advantage 
  of the <b>Hug Box, </b>a three-dimensional calming mechanism developed specifically 
  for autism sufferers. </p>
<p>In cooperation with noted researcher Temple Grandin, the Hug Box is an ingenious 
  pressurized snuggle system used for deep touch stimulation, producing a calming 
  effect on autistic or otherwise attention deficient individuals. Hug Boxes are 
  already being used in schools, clinics, and homes around the world. Each machine 
  is 60" tall, 60" long and 32" wide, constructed from 13-grade 
  3/4" birch plywood which is sealed and lacquered for a smooth durable finish. 
  All edges are rounded to ensure safety. The air controls are of outstanding 
  quality and multiple safety devices are included. Remaining components are fashioned 
  from wood, metal, and plastic. The overall look is that of traditional office 
  cubicle, with a classy, contemporary style suitable for those working in the 
  software, Internet, gaming or design industry.</p>
<p> <img src="hug-bk.jpg" width="141" height="300" align="right">The operator 
  places his head in the top area, against soft fuzzy padding. His hands slide 
  through the bottom opening to manipulate a keyboard or control joystick. As 
  the furry side panels close in at a slow pace, overstimulated nerves become 
  calm. Employees who previously paced, panted or hid under their desks during 
  a morning meeting will soon be able to make their way to the conference room 
  in a much calmer state -- without the use of a plastic mouth guard or ironcage 
  safety <img src="hugfront.jpg" width="198" height="300" align="left">helmet.</p>
<p>The Hug Box, adjustable in many ways, can be used by software engineers, QA 
  testers, videogame "producers," artistic "directors," and 
  special needs students. The machine has a series of slots and holes to accommodate 
  a laptop, a 12-oz cup of coffee, a 17" flat-panel display, and either a 
  softcover O'Reilly reference or a rolled-up yoga mat. There are also slots which 
  adjust the arm rests, sliders which allow for oversized head girths, and a hands-free 
  speaker phone. In time, rather than clamoring for standup videogame units, Segways 
  or Air Hockey tables, tomorrow's crop of autistic office workers borne of Orkut-sanctioned 
  relationships or Friendster-branded marital unions will undoubtedly learn to 
  love their complementary Hug Boxes. In a nation of eight million socially impaired 
  Rain Mans unable to make human connections, at least everyone involved can boast 
  they're a very good driver.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education recorded a nationwide autism increase of 600 
  percent between 1992 and 2004. The average child with autism will require $8 
  million in lifetime supervision and care. It's a disability with a normal life 
  expectancy affecting boys five times more than girls -- although girls are more 
  severely affected. In the United States, over one million individuals live with 
  autism, making it more prevalent than Down Syndrome, diabetes, and cancer combined.</p></p>
