<h1>SARS</h1>

<p><img src="lthumb.1051588404.jpg" width="300" height="286" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">It's 
  an intriguing notion: hiding deep within uncharted rain forests, floating beneath 
  the sea or drifting invisibly through the air, deadly microbes lie in wait - 
  and if they combine correctly in such a way as to enter the human bloodstream, 
  a merciless, devastating new plague upon humanity could be unleashed. In April 
  of 2003, a rapidly mutating virus known as <b>SARS</b> (Severe Acute Respiratory 
  Syndrome) terrified top scientists, grew to the status of a red-alert international 
  <a href="/library/medicine/epidemics/">epidemic</a>, but failed to generate much revenue at the American 
  box office.</p>
<p>The disease was spread by close <a href="/library/sex/homosexuality/">person-to-person</a> contact. 
  Those who touched <a href="/library/sex/masturbation/inventions/sex-dolls/">objects</a> which had been licked, coughed upon 
  or elsewise contaminated with spattery aerosol droplets were also infected. 
  The most documented transmissions of SARS took place among health-care workers, 
  a group of dedicated medical professionals equally susceptible to colds or the 
  flu.</p>
<p>The symptoms could sneak up on a person, moving beyond the typical nighttime 
  sniffling, <a href="/library/medicine/bodily-functions/sneezing/">sneezing</a>, coughing, aching, wheezing and stuffy head 
  - into fevers of over 100 degrees, <a href="/library/medicine/bodily-functions/delirium-tremens/">vibrating body aches and 
  chills</a>, difficulty breathing, dry <a href="http://www.gapingmaw.com/65254/">vomiting</a>, 
  muscle stiffness resembling paralysis, loss of appetite, rashes, blood coughing, 
  <a href="http://www.ratemypoo.com/ratemy/poo">diarrhea</a> and <a href="/library/death/">death</a>.</p>
<p><img src="lthumb.1051636479.jpg" width="240" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">It 
  was the next AIDS, the next <a href="/library/history/plague/">Bubonic Plague</a>, the next Pestilence 
  - and wouldn't you know it, the disease first gained notoriety in the land of 
  the Chinese Yo-Yo. <a href="/library/bio/dictators/mao/">Beijing officials</a> did everything they could to cover 
  up SARS from prying eyes - pretending everything was okay while shuttling hundreds 
  of persons (and their immediate relatives) in unmarked vans to sterile quarantine 
  camps. When truth came to light, it was disclosed that nearly 10,000 were under quarantine, 4,000 people had been infected, and over 150 had died. Close behind was Hong Kong, with 2,000 
  reported infections and 150 deaths. <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/magicians/doug-henning/">Canada</a> was placed a distant 
  third, with 343 reported cases.</p>

<p>Attempts were made to link SARS to <a href="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/">terrorism</a> (a hot topic in 
  the United States for a brief period of time during September of 2001), but 
  the Center for Disease Control seized upon the SARS genome instead. CDC scientists 
  worked c<img src="lthumb.1051518276.jpg" width="192" height="299" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">losely 
  with experts at academic institutions throughout the United States. "This 
  is an active, working community of scientific experts who have been contributing 
  their knowledge and expertise throughout this investigation," said William 
  Bellini, Ph.D., SARS laboratory team coordinator.</p>
<p>Visions of <em>The Andromeda Strain</em>, <em>12 Monkeys</em> and Stephen King's 
  <em>The Stand</em> danced in people's heads. Nearly identical viral findings 
  in the U.S. and Canada suggested the SARS problem likely originated from a common 
  source - and the race to see which country could quarantine, sequester, and 
  imprison the most people officially begun. The war on drugs, the war against 
  <a href="/library/bio/pornographers/">pornography</a>, the war against Iraq - those things were controversial 
  in nature, and hotly debated. But a "war" against a killer disease? 
  Who's going to contest that?</p>
<p>South <a href="/library/bio/religion/cult/sun-myung-moon/">Korean</a> authorities dragged huge thermal imaging machines 
  to airports in the hopes of screening both human beings and luggage for the 
  disease. If you looked sick or cranky, if you appeared to be "warmer" 
  than those standing beside you, you were pulled out of line. Toronto, Canada 
  did the same thing, examining the body temperatures of each and every arriving 
  passenger at international airports with infrared instruments. Officials were 
  forced to direct the closing of hospitals, restaurants, schools, and workplaces. 
  Within a few days, more than a thousand healthcare workers volunteered for home 
  quarantine.</p>
<p><img src="lthumb.1051535656.jpg" width="189" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><img src="lthumb.1051620641.jpg" width="300" height="198" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">The 
  World Health Organization imposed travel warnings upon Toronto - the only country 
  outside China and southeast Asia where SARS had actually killed someone. Twenty-one 
  deaths were reported in Toronto alone. The alert brought a storm of protest 
  from Canada, and hundreds of millions of dollars hemorrhaged away from tourism, 
  travel, and other businesses. The city shut down, but health warnings were removed 
  less than a week later. WHO denied succumbing to political pressure.</p>
<p>"The government of Canada and the government of Ontario are going to continue 
  to do the work that is necessary to ensure the safety and security of all of 
  the world's citizens," gasped Ontario Health Minister Tony Clement.</p>
<p>President <a href="/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">George W Bush</a>'s response to SARS was immediate, and equally informed: 
  "We hope it will have a limited effect on the U.S. economy."</p>
<p><img src="mdf266293.jpg" width="410" height="343" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><a href="/library/travel/disneyland/">Disney</a> 
  was one of the first U.S. companies to claim a direct link between SARS and 
  the worsening slump of its theme-park business.</p>
<p>Intel (one of the first U.S. firms to get smacked by SARS) laid the groundwork for how many U.S. corporations followed suit: they told employees to cancel business trips, postpone meetings and send workers home.</p>
<p><a href="/library/crime/corporate/wal-mart/">Wal-Mart</a>, the world's largest retailer, ignored warnings against business 
  travel, continuing ahead with plans to open more than 150 new stores in China.</p>
<p><a href="/library/crime/corporate/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>'s policies on how to handle SARS were set in Asia, inspired by 
  hopes that the disease was just a temporary phenomenon. "We're confident 
  of Microsoft's ability to bounce back," said Alannah Goss, a Hong Kong 
  spokeswoman. </p>
<p>Citizens of the United States who had long exhibited concerns about terrorism, 
  or confusion about the war with <a href="/library/history/countries/iraq/">Iraq</a>, or an inability to find suitable employment, 
  or an increasing reluctance to enter into conversations with European people 
  of <img src="hk.jpg" width="250" height="260" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">color 
  settled cheerfully into SARS-related anxiety disguised as not giving a shit. 
  Americans who prided themselves on rugged individualism were soon overheard 
  making bland SARS jokes in web logs or the public discourse at large. On college 
  campuses across America, SARS was the new <a href="/library/history/war/wmd/biological-weapons/">Anthrax</a>.</p>
<p><code>dickhed > I HAVE SARS :(<br>
  toiletduk > HAHAHAHAHAAHAH</code></p>
<p>Interest in SARS infected America for about twenty-four hours, and then drooped 
  faster than the twin towers. Even the animal world was falling apart. The San 
  Diego Zoo could no longer in good conscience export Hua Mei, a giant panda bear 
  - even though zookeepers weren't specifically aware of any genuine threat to 
  the animal. The zoo had an agreement with China stating that any cubs born from 
  the matings of loaned pandas must be returned to China after their third birthday. 
  Hua Mei was born August 21, 1999 - the offspring of Bai Yun and Shi Shi, who 

  has since returned to China. Shi Shi returned to Beijing, replaced by another 
  wild-born panda, Gao Gao, who has since mated with Bai Yun. Other relatives 
  include Bun Bun, Yum Fun, Lum Tum and Sum Yung Gai.</p>
<p><img src="lamdf265660.jpg" width="273" height="147" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">But 
  after coming clean about the SARS epidemic, Chinese authorities cared less about 
  pandas and more about tougher quarantine measures. Two thousand villagers in 
  Beijing torched a school after rumors surfaced that it might be used to quarantine 
  those suspected of having SARS. The building was ransacked and set on fire. 
  The mob then proceeded to the local education office and smashed it to pieces. 
  Then they visited the town hall and broke apart the entire building, breaking 
  windows, removing doors and throwing them in a burning pile. Vehicles were overturned 
  and set on fire. When anti-riot police arrived, the villagers ran.</p>
<p>The central People's Bank of China immediately put new cash into circulation, 
  holding used <a href="/library/imagery/subliminal/currency/">currency</a> for 24 hours in vaults before recycling them 
  back into circulation. Dirty, unwashed bills were showered, sterilized, and 
  subjected to ultraviolet radiation <img src="lthumb.1051594477.jpg" width="204" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">to 
  kill the SARS virus. Customers were urged to use ATM machines so bank tellers 
  wouldn't be infected. Paranoia about the relative "safety" of outdoor 
  ATM machines expanded in scope, and transactions apart from those conducted 
  on the telephone or the Internet screeched to a halt. This led to runs on banks, 
  as financial managers considered hiring people to stand outside the bankruptcy 
  registry coughing loudly to scare people away.</p>
<p><img src="lthumb.1051594548.jpg" width="197" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Beijing 
  hospitals ran short of <a href="/library/crime/drugs/marijuana/">drugs</a> and surgical guards. Disinfectants 
  and gauze face masks worn by millions of Chinese became scarce and expensive 
  in Beijing. Imported masks sold for up to $20 in convenience marts.  Villagers in southern Taiwan strapped <b>bras</b> to their faces as an alternative. Workers in a brassiere factory began cutting colorful cups apart to produce makeshift masks. Doctors 
  and nurses were described as weary and demoralized, living in makeshift quarters 
  and equally isolated from their families. Those employed in the health care 
  industry were shunned by neighbors. Rumors surfaced in <a href="/library/history/countries/south-africa/">South Africa</a> that carrying 
  around an Ace of Spades with <a href="/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam Hussein</a>' face on it would somehow keep 
  the virus at bay. A man in the <a href="/library/history/countries/philippines/">Philippines</a> stabbed another man to death 
  after accidentally being sneezed upon. A man in China <a href="/library/death/suicide/">hanged himself</a> 
  after mistakenly believing his wife had contracted the disease. Three babies 
  <img src="lthumb.1051521735.jpg" width="220" height="299" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">born 
  to SARS-infected mothers were found to have the disease, and each was placed 
  in intensive care alongside a panda.</p>
<p>Elevator buttons, door handles, toilet seats - all the ways people typically 
  pretend they got herpes were how people all over the world were contracting 
  SARS. Chinese officials in Hong Kong hosed down filthy sidewalks outside disgusting 
  eateries. Sticky, rubbery escalator handrails at shopping malls and food courts 
  were sterilized with alcohol and antiseptic.</p>
<p>One elderly patient resting in a hospital bed asked the day nurse if his <a href="/library/sex/castration/eunuch/">testicles</a> 
  were black. Exhausted and cranky, the nurse yanked forth his sheets and pointed 
  with an outstretched finger, stating loudly that the man's testicles appeared 
  just fine and that SARS was exclusively a respiratory disease. Embarrassed, 
  the patient pulled the heavy cloth mask from his face and informed her that 
  all he wanted to know was if his <i>test results were back.</i></p>
