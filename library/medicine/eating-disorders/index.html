<h1>Eating Disorders </h1>

<p>Are you constantly thinking about food? Are people concerned that you might
  be getting too skinny? Is there an ever-decreasing
  "magic number" in your head which represents your ideal weight, however
  unrealistic? No matter how many pounds are lost or gained, individuals with <i>body
  dysmorphic disorders</i> see in their mirrors
only fat, depressing failures.</p>
<p>As a public service, the <i>Rotten Library</i> is proud to manufacture
  three fictional, non-celebrity composite characters who can help shed some
  light on the mysterious inner workings of eating disorders. Please welcome <b>Anna
  Rexia, Betty Bulimic,</b> and <b>Veronica
  Vegan.</b></p>
<h1>Anna Rexia  </h1>
<p>Eating
  disorder sufferers are  psychologically blocked from being
  comfortable inside their own bodies. Anna, age 12, is neither self-absorbed,
  nor vain, nor easily influenced by glossy magazine covers. She simply started
  a diet, enjoyed the feeling of control, and then refused
  to give it up. <b>Anorexia Nervosa, </b>taken from the Greek word <i>orexe</i> (appetite)
  is characterized by an ever-decreasing willingness to eat. The causes are a
  convoluted hybrid of cultural, social, familial, psychological, and biological
  problems -- none of which can easily be solved without extended therapy or
  counseling. The vast majority of sufferers are female, and most have
  at least one emotionally absent parent. In Canada, one out every four girls
  has some level of eating disorder -- in the United States, it's estimated to
  be one in three. </p>
<p><b><img src="ed_veruca.jpg" width="350" height="233" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" ></b>As
  the obesity epidemic expands to include nearly every age group, <b>emotional
    eating</b> arrives just in time to fill the void. According to researchers
    at the Ramuda Ranch Treatment Center, eating produces a physiological sense
    of safety, reducing the agitations most commonly associated with anger, distress
    or anxiety. Blood sugar levels are reduced after a delicious meal, restoring
    feelings of pleasure and temporarily displacing depression. Anna's pleasure
    centers, meanwhile, are only tickled by those items from which she's abstained.
    Her fear of becoming fat grows more irrational with each progressive diet
    plan. She obsessively counts calories, and dresses in thick, layered garments
    to hide her weight loss from prying eyes. No matter how emaciated she may
    appear to others, she's always going to feel more than a little chubby. </p>
<p>In response to the extreme chill brought on by drastically reduced fat content,
  an anorexic's body will kick into overdrive to keep itself warm. Patients
  often develop <i><b>lanugo,</b></i> soft patches of downy peach-fuzz hair on
  the <img src="ed_flip.gif" width="258" height="609" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >face,
  back and arms. Dry, yellow skin is another hallmark of the disease, as well
  as brittle hair and nails. Twelve year old Elisha Lay of Mildura South Primary
  School in Australia developed borderline anorexia after her school instituted
  a weigh-in policy. "After you
  had your weight taken, all the kids were pressuring you to tell how much
  you weighed. I felt like people were looking at me like I was a big girl."
  She stopped eating foods like yogurt and ice cream, and then extended her denial
  to include glasses of water, which can make anorexics feel bloated. </p>
<p>Frances Sanders, chief executive of the Eating
  Disorders Foundation of Victoria, Canada suggests that weighing in shouldn't
  be part of any school program: "We've had cases of seven-year-olds being weighed
  in front of the class, and other children laughing and saying <i>you're fat.</i>"
  -- but sometimes all you can do is laugh. In 2003, rail-thin BBC comedy writer
  Debbie Barham died of an anorexia-related heart attack at the age of 26. Many
  of her gags poked fun at sufferers of the disease:</p>
<p><i>"While it might be traditional to have things on sticks
  at parties, I don't think that's actually meant to be the guests. And anything
  with fashionable asymmetric shoulders or short sleeves is a definite no-no.
  Would you like to get rid of those half-gnawed chicken drumsticks dear? Oh,
    I'm sorry -- they're your upper arms. Cheers."</i></p>
<p>And it's not just for the ladies anymore -- <b><i>manorexia</i></b> claims
  its share of victims every year, with five to fourteen percent of American
  men deliberately vomiting after every meal. While male actors rarely face
  scrutiny <i>unless</i> they get fat, Hollywood actresses are regularly criticized
  for having dangerously unhealthy bodies which set unrealistic goals
  for  young girls. What do Lindsay Lohan, Lara Flynn
  Boyle, Gwyneth Paltrow, Calista Flockhart, Mary-Kate Olsen, Tracey Gold, Paula
  Abdul, Justine Bateman, Whitney Houston and Ashlee Simpson all have in common?
  They're hideous, untalented hags who could each do with a bit of slimming.</p>
<p>Say
  what you want about women suffering from body dysmorphic disorders
  -- they've more than demonstrated that anorexia can be <i>ano-<b>sexy</b>-a!</i> Unfortunately,
  it's the most common eating disorder and therefore the least interesting. </p>

<h1>Betty Bulimic</h1>

Swiveling our camera 180 degrees across the crowded avenue, we're ready
  to zoom in on <b>Betty
    Bulimic,  </b> sitting all by her lonesome near <i>La Petite Boulangerie,</i> a
  modest afternoon snackery where the world's sweetest daydreams are manufactured
  one almond croissant at a time. Betty loves to <i>eat!</i> Each and every
  meal comes with a frosty vanilla ice cream shake, a Thanksgiving turkey
  with all the trimmings, heaping piles of mashed potatoes slathered in fresh
  country chocolate and a sensible portion of pumpkin cookie-dough ice cream
  pie for dessert, stuffed with deep-dish meat lovers' pepperoni pizza, thai-wrapped
  in a triple-thick blueberry gingerbread pancake, garnished with powdered
  confectioner's sugar, crisscrossed with hearty links of apple-smoked
  Jimmy Dean sausage and served with a paper cone stacked high with Canadian
  bacon drizzled in maple syrup. <b>And
    hey, what's that in her purse?</b> Why
  it's a big ol' folded-up cloth napkin dripping with beer-battered waffle cut
  potato wedges and a six pack of emergency corn dogs for <b>later,</b> during
  her alone time. <i>Oh,
    Betty Bulimic! You're prepared for any contingency! </i>Dunk me in gold glitter,
deep-fry me like a donut and <b>marry me you gorgeous dame.</b></p>
<p><b>Bulimia Nervosa</b> is a psychological condition, a <i>syndrome</i> first
  characterized in the early 1980s by a fierce preoccupation
  with control over one's body weight. The word <i>bulimia</i> is derived
  from the Greek words <i>bous</i> (ox or bull) and <i>limos</i> (hunger). <i>Nervosa,</i> meanwhile,
  comes from the French term for psychological unrest, <i>nerveux.</i> Put 'em
  together and our girl Betty has, quite literally, the appetite of a big fat
  freaked-out cow. </p>
<p><img src="ed_etc.jpeg" width="353" height="504" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >She
  also has an ongoing preoccupation with <b>binging</b> -- dreamlike, episodic
  trance states in which large amounts of food are consumed in
  very short periods of time. Usually the binging takes place in secret: in front
  of a TiVo'd episode of <i>America's
  Next Top Model,</i>  under the quilted naptime comforter with several pints
  of Ben & Jerry's Marsha Marsha Marshmallow -- or right there in the parking
  lot immediately following several trips around the Wendy's drive thru. The
  foods she devours are almost without exception the "forbidden foods" which
  nutritionists have universally condemned as fattening. The binging continues
  without interruption, sometimes for hours, until the urge to eat has finally
  passed or the stomach walls are so completely full and stretched out that <b>our
  poor Betty</b> feels jabbing, physical pain throughout her entire abdomen.
  When bulimia occurs in a diabetic, they may choose to neglect their
  insulin treatment because too much sugar really adds up.</p>
<p>Ironically, the boxes of Popcorn Chicken  from KFC, the buttermilk biscuits
  from Popeye's, and all those mint Double-Stuf™ Oreo cookies are all
  devoured <b>without
  enjoyment.</b> Sometimes she can't even taste them at all -- like rape, it's
  not about sex, just power. Bulimic binge eating is accompanied by severe
  anxiety and inexorable guilt. As regular as clockwork, the binging "trance"
  is over as quickly as it begins. What follows are feelings of dread,
  self-hatred, and inevitable remorse. Because Betty's superfluous overeating
  has taken place so suddenly -- and on such a massive scale -- she must immediately
  select Undo from the Fat menu <b><i>right
  now,</i></b> employing the very same secret techniques used by fifteen-year-old
  high school students around the world.</p>
<p><b><img src="ed_vomit2.jpg" width="396" height="281" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >Forced vomiting</b> <i>(purging)</i> is
  the stimulation of your throat's natural gag
    reflexes, and it's absolutely guaranteed to diminish the fattening effects
    of any and all ingested foodstuffs. Common household utensils like wooden
    spoons, toothbrushes, vibrators and  rubbery cutlery handles are all equally
    viable, but really anything large and mouth-sized can be used to trigger
    the appropriate sensations. Tie back your ponytail. Brace yourself against
    the toilet with one arm. Have a towel nearby, and maybe a glass of water. Not <b>too</b> much
    water, butterball! Insert
    the tool of your choice into your mouth. Instinctively, your throat will
    seize up, constricting or clamping shut to prevent the acceptance of a foreign
    object. It's imperative that you <b>start
    slowly,</b> easing
  the object over and behind your tongue, then up
  against the rear of your soft palette to stimulate the back of your throat.
    Damn you Betty, <i>unclench!</i> Get in the zone! </p>
<p><img src="ed_girlup.gif" width="215" height="210" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >The
  oblong insertion does not end there, however -- you must <i>try and try again</i> to
  coerce that spatula or croquet mallet down your esophagus, as close
  to your stomach  as possible. Refer to the <i>Blacks
    on Blondes</i> pornography franchise for a more visual approximation. If
    you find yourself coughing, choking, spitting, making "gag" noises
    like a cat or drooling excessively, congratulations: you're
  doing it correctly! What you vomit out first will likely be long, stringy
  strands of saliva. If your eyes are watering, chances are you're also gagging
  up mucus as well. Indeed, it's absolutely normal for first-timers to observe
  fluids draining from their noses into the toilet. The metallic, sickly tastes
  in your mouth are stomach acids, and their presence indicates that you're 
  moving in the right direction. Practice will eventually make perfect if you
  remember Betty Bulimic's number one rule: <b>nobody
    likes a quitter.</b> Even a single chopstick left over from Sunday morning's
    Chinese take-out  can be the functional equivalent of Harry Potter's
    magic wand. <i>Expecto Patronum!</i> BLORGLTHFPLTH. </p>
<p><img src="ed_couch.jpg" width="305" height="375" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >Betty,
  you've never looked more beautiful. With enough dress rehearsals, skilled purgers
  can "do their business" with impeccable discretion in the school
  bathroom, at the health club, or around the office. Learning how to vomit <b>quietly
  in public </b>without any tools at
  all is widely considered the Holy Grail of Bulimia Nervosa. Tightly-balled
  fists (preferably your own) with three or four digits extended can be jammed
  down your throat with surprisingly streamlined results. The vomiting will indeed
  give you a mild head rush similar to that of a morning cigarette, and produce
  a tranquilizing effect which serves only to strengthen your resolve. Within
  a matter of weeks, the simple ritual of kneeling down and <i>looking</i> at
  the toilet will be all the Pavlovian stimulus you'll ever need, easily enabling
  you to throw up in just a few seconds <b>without
  lifting a finger. </b>If you're serious about being popular, that is. </p>
<p>Unfortunately,
  frequent vomiting yields any number of gastric disorders, not the least of
  which is a raw, torn-up throat, a raspy cigarette voice or permanent laryngitis.
  Your salivary glands will become red and sore, inflamed from regular exposure
  to bubbling stomach acids. It's a proven, unavoidable formula: the more you
  binge and purge, the more agonizing and painful the process becomes. Too much
  acid in your mouth combined with an overall lack of nutrition means your gums
  weaken to the point where your teeth fall out. The forced, violent muscle spasms
  which frequently accompany loud vomiting can <b>rupture your esophagus,</b> leading
  to severe internal hemorrhaging. When that happens, you drown gurgling not
  only in blood but all those undigested coconut eclairs. Jeepers, Betty -- there's <i>got</i> to
be a better way.</p>
<p><img src="ed_shit.jpg" width="258" height="347" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Of
  course there is! Vomiting only rids the body of <i>part</i> of that
  Three Musketeers bar -- not all of it. In fact, vomiting can make the body <b>more</b> efficient
  at absorbing and retaining calories, since you're essentially programming yourself
  to "do more with less". Your body worked hard to transport that $11.99 order
  of Gnocchi al Pesto into your small intestine, and it's not inclined to go
  backwards simply because you have an endless laundry list of personal problems.
  While vomiting may seem to be the most <i>obvious</i> dietary
  restraint, consider adding to your repertoire some level of <b>laxative abuse.</b> This
  technique, first and foremost, has a relatively misleading name. Whether or
  not you "abuse" laxatives is a personal, private matter between you and your
  God.</p>
<p>Over-the-counter stool softeners like <i>Ex-Lax, Correctol,</i> or gentle <i>Doxidan</i> encourage
  slippery, splushier bowel movements which can  relieve constipation
  by rapidly evacuating the lower intestine. Laxative abuse is particularly popular
  among gay men. In 2001, citizen David Hurst confessed to the <i>Vancouver Courier</i> that
  he survived more than a decade of laxatives: "I used Ex-Lax like a magic chocolate
  bar. It filled my craving for chocolate, but discarded everything else I'd
  eaten too." Ahem!
  Permission to <b>not</b> have
  anal sex with you? For weeks at at time, Hurst would survive on pills,
  coffee and cigarettes -- often considering the olive in a Martini a sensible
  dinner.</p>
<p>After his partner contracted AIDS, Hurst experienced severe mononucleosis
  and landed in the hospital, where laxatives are considered a popular <i><b>prank</b></i> among
  feuding nurses! <i>The Kentucky Lexington Herald-Leader</i> reported that in
  December of 2005, Irvine Health and Rehabilitation Center nursing home attendants
  Lisa Kilburn and Kim Congleton were accused of feeding unnecessary laxatives
  to eight patients who didn't need them -- with the intended targets being rival
  nurses on the very next shift. D'oh! <i>Looks like grandma's pants
  are <b>mysteriously
  full again.</b></i></p>
<p><i><img src="ed_nug.jpg" width="283" height="283" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" ></i></p>
<h1>Veronica Vegan </h1>
<p>Finally, our saddest personal account of living with an eating disorder  comes
  to us from <b>Veronica
  Vegan,</b>  whose  deterioration first began when she was a teenager.
  Just like that fabled cobblestone road to Hell, her descent
  into madness was paved with good intentions. </p>
<p>Veronica was  a  high school freshman looking to distinguish herself from
  the overgrown landscape of gangly, indistinguishable clods passing themselves
  off as her immediate peer group. She found herself at that tender, impressionable
  age where overexposure to lukewarm bumper sticker propaganda likening <b>meat</b> to <b>murder</b> is
  somehow capable of communicating a higher spiritual
  purpose. Put four AA batteries into your Sony Walkman and sing along: <i>The
  flesh you so fancifully fry / The meat in your mouth / As you savor the flavor
  / Of murder.</i> What
  could Morrisey of <i>The
  Smiths</i> possibly be
  singing about if not <b>being kinder to animals?</b> Certainly not anonymous
  blowjobs in the train stations near Piccadilly Circus or the looming AIDS crisis
  of working-class Manchester circa 1980. Fascinated by
  the sheer whimsy of choosing to eat <i>some</i> things but <i>not others,</i> fourteen-year-old
  Veronica <img src="ed_tato.jpg" width="333" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >asked
  her mom for a ride to the public library in order to seek out further enlightenment. </p>
<p>What she found in the Young Adult section was nothing short of horrific. Poorly-bound
  volumes of black and white photographs published by PETA and dated no later
  than 1974 flew in the face of everything Veronica had ever known. Awkwardly
  printed pamphlets banged out on cheap typewriters (a font choice she incorrectly
  assumed to be fashioned after punk rock) all
  showcased disturbing visuals of <b>what
  honestly, truly happens</b> to
  cows, chickens, and pigs as they pass through the slaughterhouse. Oh, what
  filthy, inexcusable conditions! The flies and the feces! The blood and entrails!
  The snips and tails and snouts every which way! And human beings <i>eat that
  slop?</i> Good
  lord, we ought to be ashamed of ourselves. It's practically the twenty-second
  century after all! Who even <i>knows</i> which is worse: the risk factors to
  our health or the fat factors to our expanding waistlines! Hasn't anybody ever
  heard of <i>disease?</i> Why doesn't the <b>news</b> ever
  report stuff like this?</p>
<p>It never
  really occurred to Veronica that -- like fine French cheeses or healthy American
  stem cells -- farm animals are born and bred in isolated captivity for one
  exclusive purpose, and their thoughts and feelings are of little consequence.
  The grainy images on cheap Xeroxed paper comfortably insinuated themselves
  into her eager, receptive adolescent brain right then and there. With a single
  tear sliding down her face, Veronica vowed never again to eat <b>anything
    with eyeballs. </b>As
  easily as she might come out and declare herself a lesbian, Veronica
  announced to her parents and friends that she was now -- and had always been,
  and would forever be -- a
  vegetarian.</p>
<p><b>Orthorexia Nervosa </b>is a fixation on <i>righteous eating,</i> first
  diagnosed by Colorado physician Dr. Steven Bratman in 1997. The term
  is derived from the Greek word "ortho" meaning straight and <img src="ed_spag.jpg" width="400" height="369" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >correct,
  and refers to a psychological syndrome where one's food choices grow progressively
  narrower over time under the auspices of health. When vegetarians learn there's
  an even <i>more</i> restrictive diet plan available -- the way of the <i><b>vegan</b></i> --
  dairy products like milk or cheese, subclasses of poultry products
  such as eggs, and refined bread ingredients involving yeast or white flour
  are summarily stricken from their diets as well. Nothing is allowed inside
  the body of a devout vegan which might be psychologically interpreted as a
  toxin. Veronica's daily struggle to keep the "poisons" out and remain
  uncontaminated by the "wrong" food results in a total reliance upon
  what
  <i>other</i> vegans are doing to
  keep themselves alive, since they're the only ones who can ever be trusted.
  Like an oil painter who arbitrarily refuses to use yellow, a vegan
  diet  is an  attempt to gain control over at least one simple
  aspect of a person's otherwise  ordinary life -- a "less
  is more" aesthetic taken to conceited extremes.</p>
<p>Extremes
  like <b>vegan dog food,</b> completely free of meat or animal derivatives,
  composed of only organic vegetarian ingredients like soy, peas, carrots, and
  sunflower oil. Is there nothing a dog loves more than the wild, hearty grains
  of a rolled oatcake? And woe to the meat-eater <img src="ed_vdogs.jpg" width="248" height="216" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >who
  tries <i>dating</i> a
   vegan -- even for a single evening. Dr. Bratman's treatise on orthorexia cautions
  that an excessive vegan lifestyle is socially restricting -- eventually coming
  to rule a person's life to the point where all thoughts and activities revolve
  around what is and what isn't "allowed". Where people with anorexia and bulimia
  focus on quantities, people with orthorexia focus obsessively on the psychological
  qualities, the <i>purities,</i> of
  their food.</p>
<p>The decision to become a vegan  has perilous
  side effects, not the least of which is a near-constant struggle
  to prepare meals which fool the body into thinking it's getting what it really
  wants. Veronica forces herself to go through a great deal of labor and preparation
  just to make her food <b>taste</b> more like meat,
  with weird-ass spices from around the world sprinkled atop "exotic" (and mandatory)
  sauces, curries, fungus, <i>Boca</i> burgers, textured vegetable paste, <i>Tofurkey,</i> and
  other processed blends of soy and gluten. Livejournaled any vegetarian recipes
  lately? There's a lot of <b> disgusting shit</b> out there -- and if
  you thought <b>fat
    people</b> were ugly, take a goggle-eyed gander
  at vitamin-deficient vegans. The universal hallmarks of a long-term vegan
  diet absent in proteins are pallid gray skin, stringy straw-like hair, knobbled
  witchy finger knuckles, cracked lips, diminished muscle mass, protruding bones,
  yellowed teeth, a smug sense of self-satisfaction, and enough lanugo  peach
    fuzz to carpet the moon.</p>
<p><img src="ed_gross.jpg" width="315" height="237" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >In January of 2006, a Miami jury convicted Lamoy and Joseph Andressohn of
  felony child neglect for enforcing a strict diet of raw fruits, vegetables
  and wheatgrass. Their baby weighed less than seven pounds when
  she died of malnourishment, too weak to lift her head or sit without help.
  In the last three days of her life, she could only roll back her eyes. The
  autopsy reported that at the time of death, the child had "a grassy odor" and
  a bloated, distended abdomen. </p>
<p>Other children in the Andressohn family never saw
  a doctor, but received <b>wheat grass enemas</b> in lieu of traditional Western
  medicine, and testified they were taught that cooked foods were "evil." Shortly
  after the children were removed from their home by authorities, they discovered
  a new love for tacos. The mother and father, meanwhile, were ordered to abandon
  their extreme diet and keep their children on meals approved by a nutritionist. </p>
<p>So whatever happened to Anna Rexia, Betty Bulimic and Veronica Vegan?
  They  withered away and died, of course. They collapsed unceremoniously in
  the privacy of their one bedroom apartments, surrounded by Ex-Lax and cluttered
  spice racks. Each was eventually carted off in an unmarked county coroner's
  van to the city morgue. The women lay unclaimed for several weeks before being
  transported in secret to a rural rendering plant. Each was ground up by large
  machines, dissolved into slurry, freeze-dried, and scattered into the feed
  buckets of our nation's chickens, turkeys, cows and pigs. Now let's say grace.</p>
