<td valign=top><font size=-1>Interview with Steven Spielberg: "[Harrison] Ford developed dysentery in the blistering 130 degree heat of Tunisia, where the cast and crew had to fan their mouths constantly to keep out flies looking for shade (one crawled into chief villain Paul Freeman's mouth during a crucial scene). Too weak to swing his whip, Indy was slated for a three and a half page fight when Ford had a better idea. 'We had Indy pull out his revolver and dispatch the dude,' says Spielberg of the film's funniest scene."</font></td>
