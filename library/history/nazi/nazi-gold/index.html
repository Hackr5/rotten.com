<h1>Nazi Gold</h1>

<i>dem gold, dem gold, dem teeth gold</i>
<p>

SS-Hauptsturmfuehrer Bruno Melmer was the SS guy in charge of accounting for Holocaust gold.
<p>

A lot of this gold probably wound up in South America through Switzerland and <a href="/library/bio/historical/evita-peron/">Evita Peron</a>, and helped <a href="/library/history/espionage/odessa/">ODESSA</a>.
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
Captured SS records on microfilm at the National Archives show that Oswald Pohl, head of the SS Economic and Administrative Main Office, had distributed a chart that said: "Efficient utilization of the prisoner's body at the end of nine months increases this profit by the return of dental gold. It is possible at times to obtain additional revenue from the utilization of bones and ashes."
</tt></blockquote>


When the Americans discovered the Merkers mine treasure in 1945, a partial inventory revealed:
<p>

<ul>
<li>8,198 bars of gold bullion
<li>55 boxes of crated gold bullion
<li>hundreds of bags of gold items
<li>over 1,300 bags of gold Reichsmarks, British gold pounds, and French gold francs
<li>711 bags of American twenty-dollar gold pieces
<li>hundreds of bags of gold and silver coins
<li>hundreds of bags of foreign currency
<li>9 bags of valuable coins
<li>2,380 bags and 1,300 boxes of Reichsmarks (2.76 billion Reichsmarks)
<li>20 silver bars
<li>40 bags containing silver bars
<li>63 boxes and 55 bags of silver plate
<li>1 bag containing six platinum bars
<li>110 bags from various countries
</ul>
<p>

General Dwight D. Eisenhower later described the scene:
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
"Crammed into suitcases and trunks and other containers was a great amount of gold and silver plate and ornament obviously looted from private dwellings throughout Europe" he wrote. "All the articles," he noted, "had been flattened by hammer blows, obviously to save storage space, and then merely thrown into the receptacle, apparently pending an opportunity to melt them down into gold or silver bars." Later Patton would write that he saw "a number of suitcases filled with jewelry, such as silver and gold cigarette cases, wrist-watch cases, spoons, forks, vases, gold-filled teeth, false teeth, etc." acquired by "bandit methods."
