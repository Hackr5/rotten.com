In this satellite photograph taken at night above the Korean peninsula, you can make out several white splotches. Those are <i>cities</i>... as in <i>streetlights</i>... as in <i>electricity</i>. All of them are below the border in South Korea. And what about that dark area above the dividing line? Let's just say that North Koreans save a fuckload of money on their utility bills.

<li>kidnappings

<blockquote><tt>
Since the cease-fire of the Korean War in 1953, North Korea has kidnapped about 3,750 Korean citizens in more than 470 cases. Most of them were crew members of fishing boats. Most fishermen returned home after undergoing intensive brain-washing in North Korea, but 442 of them are still held in North Korea.
<p>

North Korea kidnapped a total of 3,662 fishermen along with their fishing boats. The last victim was Dongjin-ho (skipper: Kim Soon-kun) and its 20 crew members. The boat was abducted near Paeknyon Island in January 1987, and all the crew members are still detained in North Korea.

<li>heroin smuggling
<li>counterfeiting

<blockquote><tt>
Then there is the counterfeiting of U.S. $100 bills. The North Koreans have stolen both the printing presses (from Switzerland) and the formula for the pulp and paper of the U.S. currency. Their quality is reputed to be so good that one South Korean Military intelligence official told WorldNetDaily, "The North Koreans must actually lower their counterfeiting standards -- their fake bills are better made than those in the U.S."
