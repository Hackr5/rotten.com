<h1>Cuba</h1>

<ul>
<li> <a href="/library/bio/dictators/fidel-castro/">Fidel Castro</a>
<li> <a href="/library/bio/misc/che-guevara/">Che Guevara</a>
<li> <a href="/library/history/war/spanish-american-war/">Spanish-American War</a> and the sinking of the <a href="/library/history/uss-maine/">U.S.S. Maine</a>.
<li> <i>Bay of Pigs</i>.
<li> Batista's advisor for gambling reform was <a href="/library/bio/crime/mafia/meyer-lansky/">Meyer Lansky</a>.
<li> Ernest Hemingway was allegedly a spy in Cuba during <a href="/library/history/war/wwii/">World War II</a>. He supported Castro until the oven got a little bit too hot, then returned to America.
<li> Home to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, where various <a href="/library/history/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda/">al Qaeda</a> terrorists are being held in <a href="/library/crime/prison/camp-x-ray/">Camp X-Ray</a>.
<li> <a href="/library/medicine/bodily-functions/nursing/goat-suckling/">Goat Suckling</a>
<li> The <a href="/library/history/political-scandal/watergate/">Watergate</a> burglars were mostly Cuban exiles.
</ul>

<h2>Embargo</h2>

Under American embargo since 1960 because Cuba is a puppet state of the <a href="/library/history/countries/soviet-union/">Soviet Union</a>. Oh wait, that's over now. Under embargo since 1989 because, umm, uhh, I forget. We want to support Democracy or something. After all, we have a long history of supporting Democracy, such as in Chile (architecting the overthrow by <a href="/library/bio/dictators/agosto-pinochet/">Augusto Pinochet</a> of the democratically elected but mildly socialist government of Salvador Allende); in Colombia (American support of death squads who killed over three thousand); in El Salvador (American support of death squads who killed many thousands), in <a href="/library/history/countries/iraq/">Iraq</a> (American support of the regime of democrat <a href="/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam Hussein</a>, including providing him with biological weapons.)
<p>

By all means, this embargo must continue. It's important!
