<P>                              ----------                              </P>

<P>    The power to investigate ranks among the U.S. Senate's </P>
<P>highest responsibilities. As James Madison reasoned in The </P>
<P>Federalist Papers: ``If men were angels, no government would be </P>
<P>necessary. If angels governed men, neither external nor </P>
<P>internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing </P>
<P>a government which is to be administered by men over men, the </P>
<P>great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the </P>
<P>government to control the governed; and in the next place, </P>
<P>oblige it to control itself.'' It is precisely for the purposes </P>
<P>of government controlling itself that Congress investigates.</P>
<P>    A century after Madison, another thoughtful authority on </P>
<P>Congress, Woodrow Wilson, judged the ``vigilant oversight of </P>
<P>administration'' to be as important as legislation. Wilson </P>
<P>argued that because self-governing people needed to be fully </P>
<P>informed in order to cast their votes wisely, the information </P>
<P>resulting from a Congressional investigation might be ``even </P>
<P>more important than legislation.'' Congress, he said, was the </P>
<P>``eyes and the voice'' of the nation.</P>
<P>    In 1948, the Senate established the Permanent Subcommittee </P>
<P>on Investigations to continue the work of a special committee, </P>
<P>first chaired by Missouri Senator Harry Truman, to investigate </P>
<P>the national defense program during World War II. Over the next </P>
<P>half century, the Subcommittee under our predecessor Chairmen, </P>
<P>Senators John McClellan, Henry Jackson, Sam Nunn, William Roth, </P>
<P>and John Glenn, conducted a broad array of hard-hitting </P>
<P>investigations into allegations of corruption and malfeasance, </P>
<P>leading repeatedly to the exposure of wrongdoing and to the </P>
<P>reform of government programs.</P>
<P>    The phase of the Subcommittee's history from 1953 to 1954, </P>
<P>when it was chaired by Joseph McCarthy, however, is remembered </P>
<P>differently. Senator McCarthy's zeal to uncover subversion and </P>
<P>espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics </P>
<P>destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the </P>
<P>infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused </P>
<P>both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules </P>
<P>governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act </P>
<P>to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at </P>
<P>Congressional hearings. Senator McCarthy's excesses culminated </P>
<P>in the televised Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954, following </P>
<P>which the Senate voted overwhelmingly for his censure.</P>
<P>    Under Senate provisions regulating investigative records, </P>
<P>the records of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations are </P>
<P>deposited in the National Archives and sealed for fifty years, </P>
<P>in part to protect the privacy of the many witnesses who </P>
<P>testified in closed executive sessions. With the half century </P>
<P>mark here relative to the executive session materials of the </P>
<P>McCarthy subcommittee, we requested that the Senate Historical </P>
<P>Office prepare the transcripts for publication, to make them </P>
<P>equally accessible to students and the general public across </P>
<P>the nation. They were edited by Dr. Donald A. Ritchie, with the </P>
<P>assistance of Beth Bolling and Diane Boyle, and with the </P>
<P>cooperation of the staff of the Center for Legislative Archives </P>
<P>at the National Archives and Records Administration.</P>
<P>    These hearings are a part of our national past that we can </P>
<P>neither afford to forget nor permit to reoccur.</P>

<P>                              ----------                              </P>

<P>    The executive sessions of the Permanent Subcommittee on </P>
<P>Investigations for the Eighty-third Congress, from 1953 to </P>
<P>1954, make sobering reading. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy assumed </P>
<P>the chairmanship of the Government Operations Committee in </P>
<P>January 1953 and exercised prerogative, under then existing </P>
<P>rules, to chair the subcommittee as well. For the three </P>
<P>previous years, Senator McCarthy had dominated the national </P>
<P>news with his charges of subversion and espionage at the </P>
<P>highest levels of the federal government, and the chairmanship </P>
<P>provided him with a vehicle for attempting to prove and perhaps </P>
<P>expand those allegations.</P>
<P>    Elected as a Wisconsin Republican in 1946, Senator McCarthy </P>
<P>had burst into national headlines in February 1950, when he </P>
<P>delivered a Lincoln Day address in Wheeling, West Virginia, </P>
<P>that blamed failures in American foreign policy on Communist </P>
<P>infiltration of the United States government. He held in his </P>
<P>hand, the senator asserted, a list of known Communists still </P>
<P>working in the Department of State. When a special subcommittee </P>
<P>of the Foreign Relations Committee investigated these charges </P>
<P>and rejected them as ``a fraud and a hoax,'' the issue might </P>
<P>have died, but the outbreak of the Korean War, along with the </P>
<P>conviction of Alger Hiss and arrest of Julius Rosenberg in </P>
<P>1950, lent new credibility to McCarthy's charges. He continued </P>
<P>to make accusations that such prominent officials as General </P>
<P>George C. Marshall had been part of an immense Communist </P>
<P>conspiracy. In 1952, Dwight D. Eisenhower's election as </P>
<P>president carried Republican majorities in both houses of </P>
<P>Congress, and seniority elevated McCarthy to chairman of the </P>
<P>Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.</P>
<P>    Jurisdictional lines of the Senate assigned loyalty issues </P>
<P>to the Internal Security Subcommittee of the Judiciary </P>
<P>Committee, but Senator McCarthy interpreted his subcommittee's </P>
<P>mandate broadly enough to cover any government-related </P>
<P>activity, including subversion and espionage. Under his </P>
<P>chairmanship, the subcommittee shifted from searching out waste </P>
<P>and corruption in the executive branch to focusing almost </P>
<P>exclusively on Communist infiltration. The subcommittee vastly </P>
<P>accelerated the pace of its hearings. By comparison to the six </P>
<P>executive sessions held by his predecessor in 1952, McCarthy </P>
<P>held 117 in 1953. The subcommittee also conducted numerous </P>
<P>public hearings, which were often televised, but it did the </P>
<P>largest share of its work behind closed doors. During </P>
<P>McCarthy's first year as chairman, the subcommittee took </P>
<P>testimony from 395 witnesses in executive sessions and staff </P>
<P>interrogatories (by comparison to 214 witnesses in the public </P>
<P>sessions), and compiled 8,969 pages of executive session </P>
<P>testimony (compared to 5,671 pages of public hearings). </P>
<P>Transcripts of public hearings were published within months, </P>
<P>while those of executive sessions were sealed and deposited in </P>
<P>the National Archives and Records Administration. Under the </P>
<P>provisions of S. Res. 474, records involving Senate </P>
<P>investigations may be sealed for fifty years. With the approach </P>
<P>of the hearings' fiftieth anniversary, the Permanent </P>
<P>Subcommittee on Investigations authorized the Senate Historical </P>
<P>Office to prepare the executive session transcripts for </P>
<P>publication.</P>
<P>    Professional stenographers worked independently under </P>
<P>contract to the Senate to produce the original transcripts of </P>
<P>the closed hearings. The transcripts are as accurate as the </P>
<P>stenographers were able to make them, but since neither </P>
<P>senators nor witnesses reviewed their remarks, as they would </P>
<P>have for published hearings, they could correct neither </P>
<P>misspelled names nor misheard words. Several different </P>
<P>stenographers operating in Washington, New York, and </P>
<P>Massachusetts prepared the transcripts, accounting for </P>
<P>occasional variations in style. The current editing has sought </P>
<P>to reproduce the transcripts as closely to their original form </P>
<P>as possible, deleting no content but correcting apparent </P>
<P>errors--such as the stenographer's turning the town of </P>
<P>Bethpage, New York, into a person's name, Beth Page. </P>
<P>Transcribers also employed inconsistent capitalization and </P>
<P>punctuation, which have been corrected in this printed version.</P>
<P>    The executive sessions have been given the same titles as </P>
<P>the related public hearings, and all hearings on the same </P>
<P>subject matter have been grouped together chronologically. If </P>
<P>witnesses in executive session later testified in public, the </P>
<P>spelling of their names that appeared in the printed hearing </P>
<P>has been adopted. If thesubcommittee ordered that the executive </P>
<P>session testimony be published, those portions have not been reprinted, </P>
<P>but editorial notes indicate where the testimony occurred and provide a </P>
<P>citation. No transcripts were made of ``off the record'' discussions, </P>
<P>which are noted within the hearings. Senator McCarthy is identified </P>
<P>consistently as ``The Chairman.'' Senators who occasionally chaired </P>
<P>hearings in his absence, or chaired special subcommittees, are </P>
<P>identified by name. Brief editorial notes appear at the top of each </P>
<P>hearing to place the subject matter into historical context and to </P>
<P>indicate whether the witnesses later testified in public session. </P>
<P>Wherever possible, the witnesses' birth and death dates are noted. A </P>
<P>few explanatory footnotes have been added, although editorial intrusion </P>
<P>has been kept to a minimum. The subcommittee deposited all of the </P>
<P>original transcripts at the Center for Legislative Archives at the </P>
<P>National Archives and Records Administration, where they are now open </P>
<P>for research.</P>

<P>              THE PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS</P>

<P>    Following the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, the </P>
<P>Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program </P>
<P>(popularly known as the Truman committee, for its chairman, </P>
<P>Harry S. Truman) merged with the Committee on Expenditures in </P>
<P>the Executive Departments to become the Permanent Subcommittee </P>
<P>on Investigations. In 1953 the Committee on Executive </P>
<P>Expenditures was renamed the Committee on Government </P>
<P>Operations, and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (1908-1957), who had </P>
<P>joined the committee in 1947, became chairman of both the </P>
<P>committee and its permanent subcommittee. Republicans won a </P>
<P>narrow majority during the Eighty-third Congress, and held only </P>
<P>a one-seat advantage over Democrats in the committee ratios. </P>
<P>The influx of new senators since World War II also meant that </P>
<P>except for the subcommittee's chairman and ranking member, all </P>
<P>other members were serving in their first terms. Senator </P>
<P>McCarthy had just been elected to his second term in 1952, </P>
<P>while the ranking Democrat, Arkansas Senator John L. McClellan </P>
<P>(1896-1977), had first been elected in 1942, and had chaired </P>
<P>the Government Operations Committee during the Eighty-first and </P>
<P>Eighty-second Congresses. The other members of the subcommittee </P>
<P>included Republicans Karl Mundt (1900-1974), Everett McKinley </P>
<P>Dirksen (1896-1969), and Charles E. Potter (1916-1979), and </P>
<P>Democrats Henry M. Jackson (1912-1983) and Stuart Symington </P>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>    With senators serving multiple committee assignments, only </P>
<P>on rare occasions would the entire membership of any committee </P>
<P>or subcommittee attend a hearing. Normally, Senate committees </P>
<P>operated with a few senators present, with members coming and </P>
<P>going through a hearing depending on their conflicting </P>
<P>commitments. Unique circumstances developed in 1953 to allow </P>
<P>Senator McCarthy to be the sole senator present at many of the </P>
<P>subcommittee's hearings, particularly those held away from </P>
<P>Washington. In July 1953, a dispute over the chairman's ability </P>
<P>to hire staff without consultation caused the three Democrats </P>
<P>on the subcommittee to resign. They did not return until </P>
<P>January 1954. McCarthy and his staff also called hearings on </P>
<P>short notice, and often outside of Washington, which prevented </P>
<P>the other Republican senators from attending. Senators Everett </P>
<P>Dirksen and Charles Potter occasionally sent staff members to </P>
<P>represent them (and at times to interrogate witnesses). By </P>
<P>operating so often as a ``one-man committee,'' Senator McCarthy </P>
<P>gave witnesses the impression, as Harvard law school dean Erwin </P>
<P>Griswold observed, that they were facing a ``judge, jury, </P>
<P>prosecutor, castigator, and press agent, all in one.'' \2\</P>

<P>    The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 had created a </P>
<P>non-partisan professional staff for eachSenate committee. </P>
<P>Originally, staff worked for the committee as a whole and were not </P>
<P>divided by majority and minority. Chairman McCarthy inherited a small </P>
<P>staff from his predecessor, Clyde Hoey, a Democrat from North Carolina, </P>
<P>but a significant boost in appropriations enabled him to add many of </P>
<P>his own appointees. For chief counsel, McCarthy considered candidates </P>
<P>that included Robert Morris, counsel of the Internal Security </P>
<P>Subcommittee, Robert F. Kennedy, and John J. Sirica, but he offered the </P>
<P>job to Roy M. Cohn (1927-1986). The son of a New York State appellate </P>
<P>division judge, Cohn had been too young to take the bar exam when he </P>
<P>graduated from Columbia University Law School. A year later he became </P>
<P>assistant United States attorney on the day he was admitted to the bar. </P>
<P>In the U.S. attorney's office he took part in the prosecution of </P>
<P>William Remington, a former Commerce Department employee convicted of </P>
<P>perjury relating to his Communist party membership. Cohn also </P>
<P>participated in the prosecution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, and in </P>
<P>the trial of the top Communist party leaders in the United States. He </P>
<P>earned a reputation as a relentless questioner with a sharp mind and </P>
<P>retentive memory. In 1952, Cohn briefly served as special assistant to </P>
<P>Truman's attorney general, James McGranery, and prepared an indictment </P>
<P>for perjury against Owen Lattimore, the Johns Hopkins University </P>
<P>professor whom Senator McCarthy had accused of being a top Soviet </P>
<P>agent. Cohn's appointment also helped counteract the charges of </P>
<P>prejudice leveled against the anti-Communist investigations. (Indeed, </P>
<P>when he was informed that the B'nai B'rith was providing lawyers to </P>
<P>assist the predominantly Jewish engineers suspended from Fort Monmouth, </P>
<P>on the assumption of anti-Semitism, Cohn responded: ``Well, that is an </P>
<P>outrageous assumption. I am a member and an officer of B'nai B'rith.'') </P>
<P>In December 1952, McCarthy invited Cohn to become subcommittee counsel. </P>
<P>``You know, I'm going to be the chairman of the investigating committee </P>
<P>in the Senate. They're all trying to push me off the Communist issue . </P>
<P>. . ,'' Cohn recalled the senator telling him. ``The sensible thing for </P>
<P>me to do, they say, is start investigating the agriculture program or </P>
<P>find out how many books they've got bound upside down at the Library of </P>
<P>Congress. They want me to play it safe. I fought this Red issue. I won </P>
<P>the primary on it. I won the election on it, and don't see anyone else </P>
<P>around who intends to take it on. You can be sure that as chairman of </P>
<P>this committee this is going to be my work. And I want you to help </P>
<P>me.'' \3\</P>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>    At twenty-six, Roy Cohn lacked any previous legislative </P>
<P>experience and tended to run hearings more like a prosecutor </P>
<P>before a grand jury, collecting evidence to make his case in </P>
<P>open session rather than to offer witnesses a full and fair </P>
<P>hearing. Republican Senator Karl Mundt, a veteran investigator </P>
<P>who had previously served on the House Un-American Activities </P>
<P>Committee, urged Cohn to call administrative officials who </P>
<P>could explain the policies and rationale of the government </P>
<P>agencies under investigation, and to keep the hearings </P>
<P>balanced, but Cohn felt disinclined to conduct an open forum. </P>
<P>Arrogant and brash, he alienated others on the staff, until </P>
<P>even Senator McCarthy admitted that putting ``a young man in </P>
<P>charge of other young men doesn't work out too well.'' Cohn's </P>
<P>youth further distanced him from most of the witnesses he </P>
<P>interrogated. Having reached maturity during the Cold War </P>
<P>rather than the Depression, he could not fathom a legitimate </P>
<P>reason for anyone having attended a meeting, signed a petition, </P>
<P>or contributed to an organization with any Communist </P>
<P>affiliation. In his memoirs, Cohn later recounted how a retired </P>
<P>university professor once told him ``that had I been born </P>
<P>twelve or fifteen years earlier my world-view and therefore my </P>
<P>character would have been very different.'' \4\</P>

<P>    An indifferent administrator, Senator McCarthy gave his </P>
<P>counsel free rein to conduct investigations. In fact, he </P>
<P>appointed Cohn without having first removed the subcommittee's </P>
<P>previous chief counsel, Francis``Frip'' Flanagan. To remedy </P>
<P>this discrepancy, McCarthy changed Flanagan's title to general counsel, </P>
<P>although he never delineated any differences in authority. When a </P>
<P>reporter asked what these titles meant, McCarthy confessed that he did </P>
<P>not know. The subcommittee's chief clerk, Ruth Young Watt, found that </P>
<P>whenever a decision needed to be made, Cohn would say, ``Ask Frip,'' </P>
<P>and Flanagan would reply, ``Ask Roy.'' ``In other words,'' she </P>
<P>explained, ``I'd just end up doing what I thought was right.'' \5\</P>

<P>    The subcommittee held most of its hearings in room 357 of </P>
<P>the Senate Office Building (now named the Russell Senate Office </P>
<P>Building). Whenever it anticipated larger crowds for public </P>
<P>hearings, it would shift to room 318, the spacious Caucus Room </P>
<P>(now room 325), which better accommodated radio and television </P>
<P>coverage. In 1953 the subcommittee also held extensive hearings </P>
<P>in New York City, working out of the federal courthouse at </P>
<P>Foley Square and the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, while other </P>
<P>executive sessions took place at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and </P>
<P>in Boston. Roy Cohn had recruited his close friend, G. David </P>
<P>Schine (1927-1996), as the subcommittee's unpaid ``chief </P>
<P>consultant.'' The two men declined to work out of the </P>
<P>subcommittee's crowded office--Cohn did not even have a desk </P>
<P>there. (``I don't have an office as such,'' Cohn later </P>
<P>testified. ``We have room 101 with 1 desk and 1 chair. That is </P>
<P>used jointly by Mr. Carr and myself. The person who gets there </P>
<P>first occupies the chair.'' \6\) Instead, Cohn and Schine </P>
<P>rented more spacious quarters for themselves in a nearby </P>
<P>private office building. When the subcommittee met in New York, </P>
<P>Schine made his family's limousine and suite at the Waldorf-</P>
<P>Astoria available for its use. As the subcommittee's only </P>
<P>unpaid staff member, he was not reimbursed for travel and other </P>
<P>expenses, including his much-publicized April 1953 tour with </P>
<P>Cohn of U.S. information libraries in Europe. In executive </P>
<P>sessions, Schine occasionally questioned witnesses and even </P>
<P>presided in Senator McCarthy's absence, with the chief counsel </P>
<P>addressing him as ``Mr. Chairman.'' Others on the staff, </P>
<P>including James Juliana and Daniel G. Buckley, similarly </P>
<P>conducted hearing-like interrogatories of witnesses. Schine </P>
<P>continued his associations with the subcommittee even after his </P>
<P>induction into the army that November--an event that triggered </P>
<P>the chairman's epic confrontation with the army the following </P>

<P>    The hectic pace and controversial nature of the </P>
<P>subcommittee hearings during the Eighty-third Congress placed </P>
<P>great burdens on the staff and contributed to frequent </P>
<P>departures. Of the twelve staff members that McCarthy </P>
<P>inherited, only four remained by the end of the year--an </P>
<P>investigator and three clerks. Of the twenty-one new staff </P>
<P>added during 1953, six did not last the year. Research director </P>
<P>Howard Rushmore (1914-1958) resigned after four months, and </P>
<P>assistant counsel Robert Kennedy (1925-1968), after literally </P>
<P>coming to blows with Roy Cohn, resigned in August, telling the </P>
<P>chairman that the subcommittee was ``headed for disaster.'' </P>
<P>(The following year, Kennedy returned as minority counsel.) </P>
<P>When Francis Flanagan left in June 1953, Senator McCarthy named </P>
<P>J. B. Matthews (1894-1966) as executive director, hoping that </P>
<P>the seasoned investigator would impose some order on the staff. </P>
<P>Matthews boasted of having joined more Communist-front </P>
<P>organizations than any other American, although he had never </P>
<P>joined the Communist party. When he fell out of favor with </P>
<P>radical groups in the mid-1930s, he converted into an outspoken </P>
<P>anti-Communist and served as chief investigator for the House </P>
<P>Un-American Activities Committee from 1939 to 1945. An ordained </P>
<P>Methodist minister, he was referred to as ``Doctor Matthews,'' </P>
<P>although he held no doctoral degree. Just as McCarthy announced </P>
<P>his appointment to head the subcommittee staff in June </P>
<P>1953,Matthews's article on ``Reds in Our Churches'' appeared in the </P>
<P>American Mercury magazine. His portrayal of Communist sympathy among </P>
<P>the nation's Protestant clergy caused a public uproar, and Republican </P>
<P>Senator Charles Potter joined the three Democrats on the subcommittee </P>
<P>in calling for Matthews's dismissal. Although Matthews resigned </P>
<P>voluntarily, it was Senator McCarthy's insistence on maintaining the </P>
<P>sole power to hire and fire staff that caused the three Democratic </P>
<P>senators to resign from the subcommittee, while retaining their </P>
<P>membership in the full Government Operations Committee. Senator </P>
<P>McCarthy then appointed Francis P. Carr, Jr. (1925-1994) as executive </P>
<P>director, with Roy Cohn continuing as chief counsel to direct the </P>
<P>investigation.\8\</P>

<P>                        THE RIGHTS OF WITNESSES</P>

<P>    In their hunt for subversion and espionage, Senator </P>
<P>McCarthy and chief counsel Cohn conducted hearings on the State </P>
<P>Department, the Voice of America, the U.S. overseas libraries, </P>
<P>the Government Printing Office, and the Army Signal Corps. </P>
<P>Believing any method justifiable in combating an international </P>
<P>conspiracy, they grilled witnesses intensely. Senator McCarthy </P>
<P>showed little patience for due process and defined witnesses' </P>
<P>constitutional rights narrowly. His hectoring style inspired </P>
<P>the term ``McCarthyism,'' which came to mean ``any </P>
<P>investigation that flouts the rights of individuals,'' usually </P>
<P>involving character assassination, smears, mudslinging, </P>
<P>sensationalism, and guilt by association. ``McCarthyism''--</P>
<P>coined by the Washington Post cartoonist Herblock, in 1950--</P>
<P>grew so universally accepted that even Senator McCarthy </P>
<P>employed it, redefining it as ``the fight for America.'' </P>
<P>Subsequently, the term has been applied collectively to all </P>
<P>congressional investigations of suspected Communists, including </P>
<P>those by the House Un-American Activities Committee and Senate </P>
<P>Internal Security Subcommittee, which bore no direct relation </P>
<P>to the permanent subcommittee.\9\</P>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>    In these closed executive sessions, Senator McCarthy's </P>
<P>treatment of witnesses ranged from abrasive to solicitous. The </P>
<P>term ``executive sessions'' derives from the Senate's division </P>
<P>of its business between legislative (bills and resolutions) and </P>
<P>executive (treaties and nominations). Until 1929 the Senate </P>
<P>debated all executive business in closed session, clearing the </P>
<P>public and press galleries, and locking the doors. </P>
<P>``Executive'' thereby became synonymous with ``closed.'' </P>
<P>Committees held closed sessions to conduct preliminary </P>
<P>inquiries, to mark up bills before reporting them to the floor, </P>
<P>and to handle routine committee housekeeping. By hearing </P>
<P>witnesses privately, the permanent subcommittee could avoid </P>
<P>incidents of misidentification and could determine how </P>
<P>forthcoming witnesses were likely to be in public. In the case </P>
<P>of McCarthy, however, ``executive session'' took a different </P>
<P>meaning. John G. Adams, who attended many of these hearings as </P>
<P>the army's counsel from 1953 to 1954, observed that the </P>
<P>chairman used the term ``executive session'' rather loosely. </P>
<P>``It didn't really mean a closed session, since McCarthy </P>
<P>allowed in various friends, hangers-on, and favored newspaper </P>
<P>reporters,'' wrote Adams. ``Nor did it mean secret, because </P>
<P>afterwards McCarthy would tell the reporters waiting outside </P>
<P>whatever he pleased. Basically, `executive' meant that Joe </P>
<P>could do anything he wanted.'' Adams recalled that the </P>
<P>subcommittee's Fort Monmouth hearings were held in a </P>
<P>``windowless storage room in the bowels of the courthouse, </P>
<P>unventilated and oppressively hot,'' into which crowded </P>
<P>thesenator, his staff, witnesses, and observers who at various times </P>
<P>included trusted newspaper reporters, the governor of Wisconsin, the </P>
<P>chairman's wife, mother-in-law and friends. ``The `secret' hearings </P>
<P>were, after all, quite a show,'' Adams commented, adding that the </P>
<P>transcripts were rarely released to the public. This ostensibly </P>
<P>protected the privacy of those interrogated, but also gave the chairman </P>
<P>an opportunity to give to the press his version of what had transpired </P>
<P>behind closed doors, with little chance of rebuttal.\10\</P>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>    Roy Cohn insisted that the subcommittee gave ``suspects'' </P>
<P>rights that they would not get in a court of law. Unlike a </P>
<P>witness before a grand jury, or testifying on the stand, those </P>
<P>facing the subcommittee could have their attorney sit beside </P>
<P>them for consultation. The executive sessions further protected </P>
<P>the witnesses, Cohn pointed out, by excluding the press and the </P>
<P>public. But Gen. Telford Taylor, an American prosecutor at </P>
<P>Nuremberg, charged McCarthy with conducting ``a new and </P>
<P>indefensible kind of hearing, which is neither a public hearing </P>
<P>nor an executive session.'' In Taylor's view, the closed </P>
<P>sessions were a device that enabled the chairman to tell </P>
<P>newspapers whatever he saw fit about what happened, without </P>
<P>giving witnesses a chance to defend themselves or reporters a </P>
<P>chance to check the accuracy of the accusations. </P>
<P>Characteristically, Senator McCarthy responded to this </P>
<P>criticism with an executive session inquiry into Gen. Taylor's </P>
<P>loyalty. The chairman used other hearings to settle personal </P>
<P>scores with men such as Edward Barrett, State Department press </P>
<P>spokesman under Dean Acheson, and Edward Morgan, staff director </P>
<P>of the Tydings subcommittee that had investigated his Wheeling </P>
<P>speech.\11\</P>

<P>    Inclusion as a witness in these volumes in no way suggests </P>
<P>a measure of guilt. Some of the witnesses who came before the </P>
<P>permanent subcommittee in 1953 had been Communists; others had </P>
<P>not. Some witnesses cooperated by providing names and other </P>
<P>information; others did not. Some testified on subjects </P>
<P>entirely unrelated to communism, subversion or espionage. The </P>
<P>names of many of these witnesses appeared in contemporary </P>
<P>newspaper accounts, even when they did not testify in public. </P>
<P>About a third of the witnesses called in executive session did </P>
<P>not appear at any public hearing, and Senator McCarthy often </P>
<P>defined such witnesses as having been ``cleared.'' Some were </P>
<P>called as witnesses out of mistaken identity. Others defended </P>
<P>themselves so resolutely or had so little evidence against them </P>
<P>that the chairman and counsel chose not to pursue them. For </P>
<P>those witnesses who did appear in public, the closed hearings </P>
<P>served as dress rehearsals. The subcommittee also heard many </P>
<P>witnesses in public session who had not previously appeared at </P>
<P>a closed hearing, usually committee staff or government </P>
<P>officials for whom a preliminary hearing was not deemed </P>
<P>necessary. Given the rapid pace of the hearings, the </P>
<P>subcommittee staff had little time for preparation. ``No real </P>
<P>research was ever done,'' Robert Kennedy complained. ``Most of </P>
<P>the investigations were instituted on the basis of some </P>
<P>preconceived notion by the chief counsel or his staff members </P>
<P>and not on the basis of any information that had been </P>
<P>developed.'' \12\</P>

<P>    After July 1953, when the Democratic senators resigned from </P>
<P>the subcommittee, other Republican senators also stopped </P>
<P>attending the subcommittee's closed hearings, in part because </P>
<P>so many of the hearings were held away from the District of </P>
<P>Columbia and called on short notice. Witnesses also received </P>
<P>subpoenas on such short notice that they found it hard to </P>
<P>prepare themselves or consult with counsel. Theoretically the </P>
<P>committee, rather than the chairman, issued subpoenas, Army </P>
<P>Counsel John G. Adams noted. ``But McCarthy ignored the Senate </P>
<P>rule that required a vote of the other members every time he </P>
<P>wanted to haul someone in.He signed scores of blank subpoenas </P>
<P>which his staff members carried in their inside pockets, and issued as </P>
<P>regularly as traffic tickets.'' Witnesses repeatedly complained that </P>
<P>subpoenas to appear were served on them just before the hearings, </P>
<P>either the night before or the morning of, making it hard for them to </P>
<P>obtain legal representation. Even if they obtained a lawyer, the </P>
<P>senator would not permit attorneys to raise objections or to talk for </P>
<P>the witness. Normally, a quorum of at least one-third of the committee </P>
<P>or subcommittee members was needed to take sworn testimony, although a </P>
<P>single senator could hold hearings if authorized by the committee. The </P>
<P>rules did not bar ``one-man hearings,'' because senators often came and </P>
<P>went during a committee hearing and committee business could come to a </P>
<P>halt if a minimum number of senators were required to hold a </P>
<P>hearing.\13\</P>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>    When the chairman acted as a one-man committee, the tone of </P>
<P>the hearings more closely resembled an inquisition. Witnesses </P>
<P>who swore that they had never joined the Communist party or </P>
<P>engaged in espionage or sabotage were held accountable for </P>
<P>long-forgotten petitions they had signed a decade earlier or </P>
<P>for having joined organizations that the attorney general later </P>
<P>cited as Communist fronts. Seeking any sign of political </P>
<P>unorthodoxy, the chairman and the subcommittee staff </P>
<P>scrutinized the witnesses' lives and grilled them about the </P>
<P>political beliefs of colleagues, neighbors and family members. </P>
<P>In the case of Stanley Berinsky, he was suspended from the Army </P>
<P>Signal Corps at Fort Monmouth after security officers </P>
<P>discovered that his mother had once been a member of the </P>
<P>Communist party:</P>

<P>    The Chairman. Let's get this straight. I know it is unusual </P>
<P>to appear before a committee. So many witnesses get nervous. </P>
<P>You just got through telling us you did not know she was a </P>
<P>Communist; now you tell us she resigned from the Communist </P>
<P>party? As of when?</P>
<P>    Mr. Berinsky. I didn't know this until the security </P>
<P>suspension came up at Fort Monmouth.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. When was that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Berinsky. That was in 1952.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Then did your mother come over and tell you </P>
<P>she had resigned?</P>
<P>    Mr. Berinsky. I told her what happened. At that time she </P>
<P>told me she had been out for several years.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. . . . Well, did you ever ask her if she was a </P>
<P>Communist?</P>
<P>    Mr. Berinsky. No, sir. . . .</P>
<P>    The Chairman. When you went to see her, weren't you </P>
<P>curious? If somebody told me my mother was a Communist, I'd get </P>
<P>on the phone and say, ``Mother is this true''? . . .</P>
<P>    Did she tell you why she resigned?</P>
<P>    Mr. Berinsky. If seems to me she probably did it because I </P>
<P>held a government job and she didn't want to jeopardize my </P>

<P>differently about the Communist party, but because she didn't </P>

<P>    The Chairman. Was she still a Communist at heart in 1952?</P>
<P>    Mr. Berinsky. Well, I don't know how you define that.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Do you think she was a Communist, using your </P>
<P>own definition of communism?</P>
<P>    Mr. Berinsky. I guess my own definition is one who is a </P>
<P>member of the party. No.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Let's say one who was a member and dropped </P>
<P>out and is still loyal to the party. Taking that as a </P>
<P>definition, would you say she is still a Communist?</P>
<P>    Mr. Berinsky. Do you mean in an active sense?</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Loyal in her mind.</P>

<P>    Perhaps the most recurring phrase in these executive </P>
<P>session hearings was not the familiar ``Are you now or have you </P>
<P>ever been a member of the Communist party?'' That was the </P>
<P>mantra of the public hearings. Instead, in the closed hearings </P>
<P>it was ``In other words,'' which prefaced the chairman's </P>
<P>relentless rephrasing of witnesses' testimony into something </P>
<P>with more sinister implications than they intended. Given </P>
<P>Senator McCarthy's tendency toward hyperbole, witnesses </P>
<P>objected to his use of inappropriate or inflammatory words to </P>
<P>characterize their testimony. He took their objections as a </P>

<P>    A few of those who appeared before the subcommittee later </P>
<P>commented that the chairman was less intimidating in private </P>
<P>than his public behavior had led them to expect. ``Many of us </P>
<P>have formed an impression of McCarthy from the now familiar </P>
<P>Herblock caricatures. He is by no means grotesque,'' recalled </P>
<P>Martin Merson, who clashed with the senator over the Voice of </P>
<P>America. ``McCarthy, the relaxed dinner guest, is a charming </P>
<P>man with the friendliest of smiles.'' McCarthy's sometimes </P>
<P>benign treatment of witnesses in executive session may have </P>
<P>been a tactic intended to lull them into false complacency </P>
<P>before his more relentless questioning in front of the </P>
<P>television cameras, which certainly seemed to bring out the </P>
<P>worst in him. Ruth Young Watt (1910-1996), the subcommittee's </P>
<P>chief clerk from 1948 until her retirement in 1979, regarded </P>
<P>the chairman as ``a very kind man, very thoughtful of people </P>
<P>working with him,'' but a person who would ``get off on a </P>
<P>tirade sometimes'' in public hearings.\16\</P>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>    Senator McCarthy regularly informed witnesses of their </P>
<P>right to decline to answer if they felt an answer might </P>
<P>incriminate them, but he interpreted their refusal to answer a </P>
<P>question as an admission of guilt. He also encouraged </P>
<P>government agencies and private corporations to fire anyone who </P>
<P>took the Fifth Amendment before a congressional committee. When </P>
<P>witnesses also attempted to cite their First Amendment rights, </P>
<P>the chairman warned that they would be cited for contempt of </P>
<P>Congress. Although the chairman pointed out that membership in </P>
<P>the Communist party was not a crime, many witnesses declined to </P>
<P>admit their past connections to the party to avoid having to </P>
<P>name others with whom they were associated. Some witnesses </P>
<P>wanted to argue that the subcommittee had no right to question </P>
<P>their political beliefs, but their attorneys advised them that </P>
<P>it would be more prudent to decline to answer. During 1953, </P>
<P>some seventy witnesses before the subcommittee invoked the </P>
<P>Fifth Amendment and declined to answer questions concerning </P>
<P>Communist activities. Five refused to answer on the basis of </P>
<P>the First Amendment, two claimed marital privileges, and </P>
<P>Harvard Professor Wendell Furry invoked no constitutional </P>
<P>grounds for his failure toanswer questions.\17\</P>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>    Some witnesses invoked the Fifth Amendment to avoid </P>
<P>implicating those they knew to be Communists. Other invoked the </P>
<P>Fifth Amendment as a blanket response to any questions about </P>
<P>the Communist party, after being warned by their attorneys that </P>
<P>if they answered questions about themselves they could be </P>
<P>compelled to name their associates. In the case of Rogers v. </P>
<P>U.S. (1951) the Supreme Court had ruled that a witness could </P>
<P>not refuse to answer questions simply out of a ``desire to </P>
<P>protect others from punishment, much less to protect another </P>
<P>from interrogation by a grand jury.'' The Justice Department </P>
<P>applied the same reasoning to witnesses who refused to identify </P>
<P>others to a congressional committee. Since the questions were </P>
<P>relevant to the operation of the government, the department </P>
<P>assured Senator McCarthy that it was his right as a </P>
<P>congressional investigator to order witnesses to answer </P>
<P>questions about whether they know any Communists who might be </P>
<P>working in the government or in defense plants.\18\</P>

<P>    Senator McCarthy explained to witnesses that they could </P>

<P>telling the truth would incriminate them, a reasoning that </P>
<P>redefined the right against self-incrimination as incriminating </P>
<P>in itself. Calling them ``Fifth-Amendment Communists,'' he </P>
<P>insisted that ``an innocent man does not need the Fifth </P>
<P>Amendment.'' At a public hearing, the chairman pressed one </P>
<P>witness: ``Are you declining, among other reasons, for the </P>
<P>reason that you are relying upon that section of the Fifth </P>
<P>Amendment which provides that no person may be a witness </P>
<P>against himself if he feels that his testimony might tend to </P>
<P>incriminate him? If you are relying upon that, you can tell me. </P>
<P>If not, of course, you are ordered to answer. A Communist and </P>

<P>on any of the other grounds you cited.'' \19\</P>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>    Federal court rulings had given congressional investigators </P>
<P>considerable leeway to operate. In the aftermath of the Teapot </P>
<P>Dome investigation, the Supreme Court ruled in McGrain v. </P>
<P>Daugherty (1927) that a committee could subpoena anyone to </P>
<P>testify, including private citizens who were neither government </P>
<P>officials nor employees. In Sinclair v. U.S. (1929), the </P>
<P>Supreme Court recognized the right of Congress to investigate </P>
<P>anything remotely related to its legislative and oversight </P>
<P>functions. The court also upheld the Smith Act of 1940, which </P>
<P>made it illegal to advocate overthrowing the U.S. government by </P>
<P>force or violence. In 1948 the Justice Department prosecuted </P>
<P>twelve Communist leaders for having conspired to organize ``as </P>
<P>a society, group and assembly of persons who teach and advocate </P>
<P>the overthrow and destruction of the Government of the United </P>
<P>States by force and violence.'' Upholding their convictions, in </P>
<P>Dennis v. U.S. (1951), the Supreme Court denied that their </P>
<P>prosecution had violated the First Amendment, on the grounds </P>
<P>that the government's power to prevent an armed rebellion </P>
<P>subordinated free speech. During the next six years 126 </P>
<P>individuals were indicted solely for being members of the </P>
<P>Communist party. The Mundt-Nixon Act of 1950 further barred </P>
<P>Communist party members from employment in defense </P>
<P>installations, denied them passports, and required them to </P>
<P>register with the Subversive Activities Control Board. In </P>
<P>Rogers v. U.S. (1951) the Supreme Court declared that a witness </P>
<P>who had testified that she was treasurer of a localCommunist </P>
<P>party and had possession of its records could not claim the Fifth </P>
<P>Amendment when asked to whom she gave those records. Her initial </P>
<P>admission had waived her right to invoke her privilege and she was </P>
<P>guilty of contempt for failing to answer.</P>
<P>    Not until after Senator McCarthy's investigations had </P>
<P>ceased did the Supreme Court change direction on the rights of </P>
<P>congressional witnesses, in three sweeping decisions handed </P>
<P>down on June 17, 1957. In Yates v. U.S. the court overturned </P>
<P>the convictions of fourteen Communist party members under the </P>
<P>Smith Act, finding that organizing a Communist party was not </P>
<P>synonymous with advocating the overthrow of the government by </P>
<P>force and violence. As a result, the Justice Department stopped </P>
<P>seeking further indictments under the Smith Act. In Watkins v. </P>
<P>U.S., the court specified that an investigating committee must </P>
<P>demonstrate a legislative purpose to justify probing into </P>
<P>private affairs, and ruled that public education was an </P>
<P>insufficient reason to force witnesses to answer questions </P>
<P>under the penalty of being held in contempt. These rulings </P>
<P>confirmed that the Bill of Rights applied to anyone subpoenaed </P>
<P>by a congressional committee.\20\</P>

<P>    If witnesses refused to cooperate, the chairman threatened </P>
<P>them with indictment and incarceration. At the end of his first </P>
<P>year as chairman, he advised one witness: ``During the course </P>
<P>of these hearings, I think up to this time we have some--this </P>
<P>is just a rough guess--twenty cases we submitted to the grand </P>
<P>jury, either for perjury or for contempt before this committee. </P>
<P>Do not just assume that your name was pulled out of a hat. </P>
<P>Before you were brought here, we make a fairly thorough and </P>

<P>to either tell the truth or, if you think the truth will </P>
<P>incriminate you, then you are entitled to refuse to answer. I </P>

<P>giving you. Do you understand that?'' In the end, however, no </P>
<P>witness who appeared before the subcommittee during his </P>
<P>chairmanship was imprisoned for perjury, contempt, espionage, </P>
<P>or subversion. Several witnesses were tried for contempt, and </P>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>

<P>                         AREA OF INVESTIGATION</P>

<P>    Following the tradition of the Permanent Subcommittee on </P>
<P>Investigations, the first executive session hearings in 1953 </P>
<P>dealt with influence peddling, an outgrowth of an investigation </P>
<P>begun in the previous Congress. Senator McCarthy absented </P>
<P>himself from most of the influence-peddling hearings and left </P>
<P>Senator Karl Mundt or Senator John McClellan, the ranking </P>
<P>Republican and Democrat on the Government Operations Committee, </P>
<P>to preside in his place. But the chairman made subversion and </P>
<P>espionage his sole mission. On the day that the subcommittee </P>
<P>launched a new set of hearings on influence peddling, it began </P>
<P>hearings on the State Department's filing system, whose </P>
<P>byzantine complexity Senator McCarthy attributed to either </P>
<P>Communist infiltration of gross incompetence.</P>
<P>    With the State Department investigation, Senator McCarthy </P>
<P>returned to familiar territory. His Wheeling speech in 1950 had </P>
<P>accused the department of harboring known Communists. The </P>
<P>senator demanded that the State Department open its ``loyalty </P>
<P>files,'' and then complained that it provided only ``skinny-</P>
<P>ribbed bones of the files,'' ``skeleton files,'' ``purged </P>
<P>files,'' and ``phony files.'' The chairman's interest was </P>
<P>naturally piqued in 1953 when State Department security officer </P>
<P>John E. Matson reported irregularitiesin the department's </P>
<P>filing system, and charged that personnel files had been ``looted'' of </P>
<P>derogatory information in order to protect disloyal individuals. </P>
<P>Although State Department testimony suggested that its system had been </P>
<P>designed to protect the rights of employees in matters of career </P>
<P>evaluation and promotion, Senator McCarthy contended that there had </P>
<P>been a conspiracy to manipulate the files.\22\</P>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>    A brief investigation of homosexuals as security risks also </P>
<P>grew out of previous inquiries. In 1950, Senator McCarthy </P>
<P>denounced ``those Communists and queers who have sold 400 </P>
<P>million Asiatic people into atheistic slavery and have American </P>
<P>people in a hypnotic trance, headed blindly toward the same </P>
<P>precipice.'' He often laced his speeches with references to </P>
<P>``powder puff diplomacy,'' and accused his opponents of </P>
<P>``softness'' toward communism. ``Why is it that wherever it is </P>
<P>in the world that our State Department touches the red-hot </P>
<P>aggression of Soviet communism there is heard a sharp cry of </P>
<P>pain--a whimper of confusion and fear? . . . Why must we be </P>
<P>forced to cringe in the face of communism?'' By contrast, he </P>
<P>portrayed himself in masculine terms: in rooting out communism </P>
<P>he ``had to do a bare-knuckle job or suffer the same defeat </P>
<P>that a vast number of well-meaning men have suffered over past </P>
<P>years. It has been a bare-knuckle job. As long as I remain in </P>
<P>the Senate it will continue as a bare-knuckle job.'' The </P>
<P>subcommittee had earlier responded to Senator McCarthy's </P>
<P>complaint that the State Department had reinstated homosexuals </P>
<P>suspended for moral turpitude with an investigation in 1950 </P>
<P>that produced a report on the Employment of Homosexuals and </P>
<P>Other Sex Perverts in Government. The report had concluded that </P>
<P>homosexuals' vulnerability to blackmail made them security </P>
<P>risks and therefore ``not suitable for Government positions.'' </P>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>    The closed hearings shifted to two subsidiaries of the </P>
<P>State Department, the Voice of America and the U.S. information </P>
<P>libraries, which had come under the department's jurisdiction </P>
<P>following World War II. Dubious about mixing foreign policy and </P>
<P>propaganda, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles viewed the </P>
<P>Voice of America as an unwanted appendage and was not </P>
<P>unsympathetic to some housecleaning. It was not long, however, </P>
<P>before the Eisenhower administration began to worry that </P>
<P>McCarthy's effort to clean out the ``left-wing debris'' was </P>
<P>disrupting its own efforts to reorganize the government. </P>
<P>Senator McCarthy also looked into allegations of Communist </P>
<P>literature on the shelves of the U.S. Information Agency </P>
<P>libraries abroad. Rather than call the officials who </P>
<P>administered the libraries, the subcommittee subpoenaed the </P>
<P>authors of the books in question, along with scholars and </P>
<P>artists who traveled abroad on Fulbright scholarships. These </P>
<P>witnesses became innocent bystanders in the cross-fire between </P>
<P>the subcommittee and the administration as the senator expanded </P>
<P>his inquiry from examinations of files and books to issues of </P>
<P>espionage and sabotage, warning audiences: ``This is the era of </P>
<P>the Armageddon--that final all-out battle between light and </P>
<P>darkness foretold in the Bible.'' Zealousness in the search for </P>
<P>subversives made the senator unwilling to accept bureaucratic </P>
<P>explanations on such matters as personnel files and loyalty </P>
<P>board procedures in the State Department, the Government </P>
<P>Printing Office, and the U.S. Army.\24\</P>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>    Many of McCarthy's investigations began with a flurry of </P>
<P>publicity and then faded away. Richard Rovere, who covered the </P>
<P>subcommittee's hearings for the New Yorker, observed that </P>
<P>investigation of the Voice of America was never completed. ``It </P>
<P>just stopped--its largest possibilities for tumult had </P>
<P>beenexhausted, and it trailed off into nothingness.'' \25\ Before </P>
<P>completing one investigation, the subcommittee would have launched </P>
<P>another. The hectic pace of hearings and the large number of witnesses </P>
<P>it called strained the subcommittee's staff resources. Counsels coped </P>
<P>by essentially asking the same questions of all witnesses. ``For the </P>
<P>most part you wouldn't have time to do all your homework on that, we </P>
<P>didn't have a big staff,'' commented chief clerk Ruth Watt. As a </P>
<P>result, the subcommittee occasionally subpoenaed the wrong individuals, </P>
<P>and used the closed hearings to winnow out cases of mistaken identity. </P>
<P>Some of those who were subpoenaed failed to appear. As Roy Cohn </P>
<P>complained of the authors whose books had appeared in overseas </P>
<P>libraries, ``we subpoena maybe fifty and five show up.'' \26\</P>

<P>    When Senator McCarthy was preoccupied or uninterested in </P>

<P>hearings. Senator Charles Potter, for example, chaired a series </P>
<P>of hearings on Korean War atrocities whose style, demeanor, and </P>
<P>treatment of witnesses contrasted sharply with those that </P>
<P>Senator McCarthy conducted; they are included in these volumes </P>
<P>as a point of reference. Other hearings that stood apart in </P>

<P>assistant counsel Robert F. Kennedy.\27\</P>

<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>    The subcommittee's investigations exposed examples of lax </P>
<P>security in government agencies and defense contractors, but </P>
<P>they failed to substantiate the chairman's accusations of </P>
<P>subversion and espionage. Critics accused Senator McCarthy of </P>
<P>gross exaggerations, of conducting ``show trials'' rather than </P>
<P>fact-finding inquiries, of being careless and indifferent about </P>
<P>evidence, of treating witnesses cavalierly and of employing </P>
<P>irresponsible tactics. Indeed, the chairman showed no qualms </P>
<P>about using raw investigative files as evidence. His </P>
<P>willingness to break the established rules encouraged some </P>
<P>security officers and federal investigators to leak </P>
<P>investigative files to the subcommittee that they were </P>
<P>constrained by agency policy from revealing. Rather than lead </P>
<P>to the high-level officials he had expected to find, the leaked </P>
<P>security files shifted his attention to lower-level civil </P>
<P>servants. Since these civil servants lacked the freedom to </P>
<P>fight back in the political arena, they became ``easier targets </P>
<P>to bully.'' \28\ Even Roy Cohn conceded that McCarthy invited </P>
<P>much of the criticism ``with his penchant for the dramatic,'' </P>
<P>and ``by making statements that could be construed as promising </P>
<P>too much.'' \29\</P>

<P>    Having predicted to the press that his inquiry into </P>
<P>conditions at Fort Monmouth would uncover espionage, Senator </P>
<P>McCarthy willingly accepted circumstantial evidence as grounds </P>
<P>for the dismissal of an employee from government-related </P>
<P>service. The subcommittee's dragnet included a number of </P>
<P>perplexed witnesses who had signed a nominating petition years </P>
<P>earliers, belonged to a union whose leadership included alleged </P>
<P>Communists, bought an insurance policy through an organization </P>
<P>later designated a Communist front organization, belonged to a </P>
<P>Great Books club that read Karl Marx among other authors, had </P>
<P>once dated a Communist, had relatives who were Communists, or </P>
<P>simply had the same name as a Communist. Thosewitnesses against </P>
<P>whom strong evidence of Communist activities existed tended to be </P>
<P>involved in labor organizing--hardly news since the Congress of </P>
<P>Industrial Organizations (CIO) had already expelled such unions as the </P>
<P>Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians and the </P>
<P>United Electrical Workers, whom McCarthy investigated. Those witnesses </P>
<P>who named names of Communists with whom they had associated invariably </P>
<P>described union activities, and none corroborated any claims of </P>
<P>subversion and espionage.</P>
<P>    Critics questioned Senator McCarthy's sincerity as a </P>
<P>Communist hunter, citing his penchant for privately embracing </P>
<P>those whom he publicly attacked; others considered him a </P>
<P>classic conspiracy theorist. Once he became convinced of the </P>
<P>existence of a conspiracy, nothing could dissuade him. He </P>
<P>exhibited impatience with those who saw things differently, </P>
<P>interpreted mistakes as deliberate actions, and suspected his </P>
<P>opponents of being part of the larger conspiracy. He would not </P>
<P>entertain alternative explanations and stood contemptuous of </P>
<P>doubters. A lack of evidence rarely deterred him or undermined </P>
<P>his convictions. If witnesses disagreed on the facts, someone </P>
<P>had to be lying. The Fort Monmouth investigation, for instance, </P>
<P>had been spurred by reports of information from the Army Signal </P>
<P>Corps laboratories turning up in Eastern Europe. Since Julius </P>
<P>Rosenberg had worked at Fort Monmouth, McCarthy and Cohn were </P>
<P>convinced that other Communist sympathizers were still </P>
<P>supplying secrets to the enemy. But the Soviet Union had been </P>
<P>an ally during the Second World War, and during that time had </P>
<P>openly designated representatives at the laboratories, making </P>
<P>espionage there superfluous. Nevertheless, McCarthy's pursuit </P>
<P>of a spy ring caused officials at Fort Monmouth to suspend </P>
<P>forty-two civilian employees. After the investigations, all but </P>
<P>two were reinstated in their former jobs.</P>
<P>    Not until January 1954, did the remaining subcommittee </P>
<P>members adopt rules changes that Democrats had demanded, and </P>
<P>Senators McClellan, Jackson and Symington resumed their </P>
<P>membership on the subcommittee. These rules changes removed the </P>
<P>chairman's exclusive authority over staffing, and gave the </P>
<P>minority members the right to hire their own counsel. Whenever </P>
<P>the minority was unanimously opposed to holding a public </P>
<P>hearing, the issue would go to the full committee to determine </P>
<P>by majority vote. Also in 1954, the Republican Policy Committee </P>
<P>proposed rules changes that would require a quorum to be </P>
<P>present to hold hearings, and would prohibit holding hearings </P>
<P>outside of the District of Columbia or taking confidential </P>
<P>testimony unless authorized by a majority of committee members. </P>
<P>In 1955 the Permanent Subcommittee adopted rules similar to </P>
<P>those the Policy Committee recommended.\30\</P>

<P>    Following the Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954, the Senate </P>
<P>censured Senator McCarthy in December 1954 for conduct </P>
<P>unbecoming of a senator. Court rulings in subsequent years had </P>
<P>a significant impact on later congressional investigations by </P>
<P>strengthening the rights of witnesses. Later in the 1950s, </P>
<P>members and staff of the Permanent Subcommittee on </P>
<P>Investigations joined with the Senate Labor and Public Welfare </P>
<P>Committee to form a special committee to investigate labor </P>
<P>racketeering, with Robert F. Kennedy as chief counsel. </P>
<P>Conducted in a more bipartisan manner and respectful of the </P>
<P>rights of witnesses, their successes helped to reverse the </P>
<P>negative image of congressional investigations fostered by </P>
<P>Senator McCarthy's freewheeling investigatory style.</P>

<P>                            RUSSELL W. DUKE</P>

<P>    [Editor's note.--The inquiry into the alleged influence-</P>
<P>peddling of Russell W. Duke (1907-1978) in U.S. tax cases and </P>
<P>his cooperation with Washington lawyer Edward P. Morgan (1913-</P>
<P>1986), was a continuation of similar investigations that the </P>
<P>subcommittee had conducted during the previous Congress, but </P>
<P>the subcommittee's new chairman, Senator McCarthy, had a </P>
<P>personal interest in both these men. Russell Duke, who lived in </P>
<P>Oregon, maintained close ties to Senator Wayne Morse, one of </P>
<P>McCarthy's outspoken critics, while Edward Morgan had served as </P>
<P>counsel to the Foreign Relations Committee subcommittee, </P>
<P>chaired by Senator Millard Tydings, that examined McCarthy's </P>
<P>Wheeling, West Virginia, charges about Communists in the State </P>
<P>Department. The Tydings subcommittee rejected McCarthy's claims </P>
<P>as a ``fraud and a hoax.'' In 1952, Morgan had campaigned </P>
<P>against McCarthy's reelection.</P>
<P>    The subcommittee seized all of Duke's records in a garage </P>
<P>in San Francisco, and subpoenaed all of Morgan's records </P>
<P>relating to Duke. At the same time, a subcommittee of the House </P>
<P>Judiciary Committee also investigated the case, and two members </P>
<P>of that committee audited the Senate subcommittee's executive </P>
<P>session.</P>
<P>    Duke was served with a subpoena on January 11, 1953. After </P>
<P>testifying in executive session, he was informed that he would </P>
<P>need to reappear to testify in public on February 2. But the </P>
<P>public hearing was postponed ``until some other date to be </P>
<P>designated.'' Duke was later instructed to appear on April 13, </P>
<P>but had already gone to Canada. Informed that the subpoena was </P>
<P>``a continuing one,'' he was ordered to return. When he failed </P>
<P>to appear, the subcommittee unanimously voted him in contempt. </P>
<P>In November, Duke was arrested in Cleveland, Ohio, and brought </P>
<P>to Washington to stand trial. On January 26, 1954, Judge </P>
<P>Burnita S. Matthews of the U.S. District Court for the District </P>
<P>of Columbia found him not guilty of contempt for failing to </P>
<P>honor a subpoena in April that had originally been issued for </P>
<P>January 15. Senator McCarthy vowed to issue another subpoena. </P>
<P>``If Duke refuses to obey this one, we'll have him cited </P>
<P>again,'' he told reporters, ``and this time I hope his case is </P>
<P>heard by a judge who knows the law.'' However, the subcommittee </P>
<P>did not pursue the matter any further.</P>
<P>    Russell W. Duke did not testify in public session.]</P>

<P>    The Chairman. We will have the record show that present are </P>
<P>Senator Potter, Senator McClellan, Senator Jackson, Senator </P>
<P>Symington, and Senator McCarthy, and Congressman Keating of the </P>
<P>House Judiciary Subcommittee, and Congressman Patrick Hillings.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Mr. Chairman, I should report to you </P>
<P>that pursuant to the resolution or motion adopted at the </P>
<P>meeting of the full committee on yesterday, I have appointed as </P>
<P>members of the minority of this subcommittee the following </P>
<P>Senator Symington, Senator Jackson, and myself.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Let the record show that yesterday in the </P>
<P>full committee meeting with a quorum present, the motion was </P>
<P>made, seconded and passed that the four Republican members, </P>
<P>Senator Potter, Senator McCarthy, Senator Dirksen, and Senator </P>
<P>Mundt, were confirmed as members of the subcommittee, and also </P>
<P>confirmed were the members to be subsequently nominated or </P>
<P>appointed by Senator McClellan, which has now been done.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke, in this matter before the subcommittee, do you </P>
<P>solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing </P>
<P>but the truth, so help you God?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I do.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Mr. Duke, before we start, I would like to </P>
<P>make a suggestion, due to the fact that you are here without </P>
<P>counsel. Time after time, witnesses have come and they have not </P>
<P>been guilty of any criminal activity of any kind until they </P>
<P>testify, and they make the mistake of thinking they can </P>
<P>outsmart the committee and make the mistake of lying, in other </P>
<P>words, committing perjury. So I would like to suggest to you </P>
<P>for your own protection that you do one of two things: that you </P>
<P>either tell the truth, or that you refuse to answer. You have a </P>
<P>right to refuse to answer any question the answer to which you </P>
<P>think might incriminate you. So I would suggest to you that for </P>
<P>your own protection you either tell us the truth and nothing </P>
<P>but the truth, or else avail yourself of the privilege of </P>
<P>refusal to answer.</P>

<P>                  TESTIMONY OF RUSSELL W. DUKE</P>

<P>    Mr. Flanagan. What is your full name and your permanent </P>
<P>address?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Russell W. Duke. Unfortunately, I don't have any </P>
<P>permanent address.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Is Russell W. Duke your legal name now?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It has been for years, yes, it is my legal name.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you previously have another name?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. What was that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. D-u-t-k-o.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Where were you born?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. St. Clair, Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. What was your birth date?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. February 11, 1907.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. When did you first begin to engage in the </P>
<P>public relations business?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I have--about 1934 or 1935.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. You have been engaged in that business </P>
<P>continuously?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not continuously, no.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. When did you engage in any other business </P>
<P>since 1934 or 1935, other than public relations?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I have continuously been engaged in various </P>
<P>businesses. I have been in the manufacturing business, in the </P>
<P>sales business, the procurement business, the real estate </P>
<P>business.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. When did you first begin to act as public </P>
<P>relations counsel or representative in cases involving the </P>
<P>federal government, such as tax cases, claims, and the like?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. In about 1946, '47, '48.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Can you recite the number of cases, that is, </P>
<P>federal tax cases, in which you were employed as a public </P>
<P>relations counsel?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not until I look in my books to be able to tell </P>
<P>you that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. But you were employed in a number of federal </P>
<P>tax cases as public relations counsel?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I was.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. What were your duties and responsibilities, </P>
<P>as you saw them, as a public relations counsel in a tax case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Well, I learned that in a lot of cases, upon </P>
<P>investigating the case after the Internal Revenue Department </P>
<P>got through with it, there were a lot of errors created by the </P>
<P>agent that put a burden upon the taxpayer, over-assessed him </P>
<P>various and sundry amounts that should not have been assessed, </P>
<P>and I would engage certified public accountants to recheck the </P>
<P>books, definitely determine if these over-assessments were </P>
<P>justified or not, and then either call it to the attention of </P>
<P>the Internal Revenue Department, the various heads of the </P>
<P>Internal Revenue Department, and if they did not do anything </P>
<P>about it, then advise the client to secure competent tax </P>
<P>counsel.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Are you an accountant?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, but I can do book work.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Have you ever had any accounting training of </P>
<P>any kind?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Practical, yes. I was with Sears, Roebuck Company </P>
<P>for seven-and-a-half years.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. As an accountant?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, in their legal department.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. What did you do in the legal department?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I was assigned to various stores, and I had </P>
<P>forty-six stores in eight states, and my position was to go to </P>
<P>the various stores and go over their accounts and check them to </P>
<P>see if there was any discrepancy in them, and find out if all </P>
<P>of the accounts are live.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. You were an auditor, in other words?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not as an auditor; more of an investigator.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Are you a lawyer?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Can you tell us the names of the various </P>
<P>counsel that you recommended in some of these tax cases that </P>
<P>you were public relations counsel for?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Oh, yes. I recommended probably in the past, </P>
<P>prior to 1946 or 1947----</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. I am not talking about prior; I am talking of </P>
<P>since then.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Bob Murphy from Keenan &amp; Murphy; Morgan, of </P>
<P>Welch, Mott &amp; Morgan--again, I would have to look at my files </P>
<P>to refresh my memory, because I have recommended various legal </P>
<P>firms.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever recommend Conrad Hubner, of San </P>
<P>Francisco?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. On the coast I have, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Who else on the coast have you recommended as </P>
<P>an attorney?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Stephen Chadwick, quite a prominent attorney in </P>
<P>Seattle, and I don't recall. Again, I would have to go into my </P>
<P>files to check.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Do you recall the specific cases in which you </P>
<P>had an interest and in which Edward P. Morgan also had an </P>
<P>interest as a lawyer?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Some of them I can recall, but not all of them.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Can you recite those that you can recall?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. There was Dr. Ting Lee, Wilcox----</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Where was Ting Lee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Portland, Oregon.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. And the next case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. And the Noble Wilcoxon case in Sacramento.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Any others?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Again, I would have to check the file.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. How about the Jack Glass case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I referred that to Morgan.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. How about the Guy Schafer case in Oakland?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I referred that to Morgan.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. How about the Harry Blumenthal case in San </P>
<P>Francisco?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Well, that was a case wherein Hubner wanted me to </P>
<P>get him counsel in Washington, and through me he associated </P>
<P>with Morgan on that case.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever attempt to get Morgan in as an </P>
<P>attorney in the Inez Burns case in San Francisco?</P>
<P>    Mr, Duke. No. I was requested in San Francisco some time </P>
<P>ago to get information on the Inez Burns case back here, to </P>
<P>find out why it was laying dormant in San Francisco.</P>
<P>    Mr Flanagan. Who requested you to do that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall whether it was the Burns attorney </P>
<P>or whom, right at the moment, who it was, and I came back here </P>
<P>and inquired of the Internal Revenue Department and told them </P>
<P>that the case was laying dormant back there and it had been </P>
<P>dormant for about two years, and they wanted to find out why it </P>
<P>wasn't coming to a head. I couldn't find out anything, and so I </P>
<P>requested Mr. Wilson, the administrative aide of Senator </P>
<P>Knowland's office, if he would make inquiry of the Internal </P>
<P>Revenue Department to find out why the Internal Revenue </P>
<P>Department wasn't bringing the case to a head.\1\</P>
<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>    \1\ George F. Wilson, administrative assistant to Senator William </P>
<P>F. Knowland (Republican-California).</P>
<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>    He did find out, or learn why, and sent me a copy of the </P>
<P>letter; and at the same date I was here, I inquired of Mr </P>
<P>Morgan if he could aid me in finding out why the case was </P>
<P>laying dormant, and that was about the gist of the Inez Burns </P>
<P>case.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did Mr. Morgan find out anything for you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. The letter is there, and will probably answer it </P>
<P>best, and I don't recall what was in the body of that letter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did he get a fee out of that case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Did he?</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't think so. I doubt it very much. I don't </P>
<P>know.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Now, how would you locate these tax cases, </P>
<P>and how would you be brought into them?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Well, there were various means, and some </P>
<P>accounting firms would call me, and I knew quite a number of </P>
<P>accounting firms on the coast, and I knew a lot of people that </P>
<P>had friends that were involved in these tax cases who asked if </P>
<P>I could help them out in any way.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. In other words, they would come to you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Some cases, in some instances, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. In some instances did you go to them and </P>
<P>suggest that they retain you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I sure did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Can you tell us a case in which you went to </P>
<P>either the taxpayer's lawyer or someone connected with it, and </P>
<P>told them that they ought to retain your services?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. The Wilcoxon case is fresh in my memory.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. That is the Noble Wilcoxon case at </P>
<P>Sacramento?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. To whom did you go?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I went to Mr. Wilcoxon.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. What did you tell him?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall right now, I really don't. If you </P>
<P>want me to tell you verbatim what I told him, I wouldn't </P>
<P>recall. I could probably give you an idea.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Give us in substance what you told him.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I probably told him, knowing he was in tax </P>
<P>difficulties, and asked him if he had competent counsel, and </P>
<P>how far they had gone with it, and checked his records and </P>
<P>books, and found probably a discrepancy in his records or </P>
<P>books, where the Internal Revenue Department made errors, and </P>
<P>then advised him that he should get Washington counsel, someone </P>
<P>that had good legal training in tax matters.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. How did you find out that he was in tax </P>
<P>trouble?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall right now.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. You have no idea how you found out?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I wouldn't say I have no idea. At the moment I </P>
<P>haven't. If I could sit down and go through my files, probably </P>
<P>there is something there that would refresh my memory.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. What is your best present recollection as to </P>
<P>how that case came to your attention?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. If I gave you an answer to that, it would be just </P>
<P>guesswork, and I really couldn't answer that until, as I say, I </P>
<P>had checked through the entire file in the Wilcoxon case.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. I have here a letter, Mr. Duke, or a copy of </P>
<P>a letter, dated September 10, 1949, which was taken from your </P>
<P>files. This letter is addressed to Edward P. Morgan in </P>
<P>Washington and, being a copy, it has your typed signature on </P>
<P>it. We will put this in the record, but for the present I will </P>
<P>just read certain paragraphs from it and ask you some questions </P>
<P>about it.</P>
<P>    [The letter referred to was marked as committee's Exhibit, </P>
<P>No. 11 January 15, 1953, R. W. Duke, and is as follows:]</P>

<P>                                       Portland 13, Oregon,</P>
<P>                                                September 10, 1949.</P>
<P>Mr. Ed Morgan,</P>
<P>Welsh, Mott &amp; Morgan, 7100 Erickson Building,</P>
<P>Fourteen Northwest, Washington, DC.</P>
<P>    Dear Ed: Since my conversation with you over the phone regarding </P>
<P>Senator Morse, yourself, and myself discussed in your office, I can </P>
<P>only repeat as I stated in my previous letter--Senator Morse, his </P>
<P>integrity, honesty, and sincerity is something to be highly admired and </P>
<P>respected. At no time have I ever known him to make an idle promise. I </P>
<P>shall see that you will be given assurance in person immediately after </P>
<P>the 12th of this month complying with the request you had made of me.</P>
<P>    Talent, Ed, is what I want. I am going to make my tour of the South </P>
<P>(incidentally, Nevada and Idaho are good territory) and make one </P>
<P>complete thrust to bring all the talent I possibly can to Washington.</P>
<P>    I understand there are 23 applications in Oregon for television. </P>
<P>Can you confirm that?</P>
<P>    Well, Ed, oil lands in Oregon are going to surprise the nation. In </P>
<P>delving through old records in the capitol recently, I ran across a </P>
<P>survey and drilling tests that were made in a certain county by the </P>
<P>Texas Oil Company, and their findings are so important that they will </P>
<P>illicit from anyone who would go over them a thrilling surprise. At the </P>
<P>time of the Teapot Dome scandal, Texas Oil Company, in conjunction with </P>
<P>Sinclair Company, was contemplating stealing the leases for this </P>
<P>particular area; sank seven wells; and each well was capped off as soon </P>
<P>as Fall, Dohney, and Daugherty were indicted, and it has been a dead </P>
<P>duck ever since. People filed homesteads on this particular land and </P>
<P>have since cut out the forests for lumber purposes and have abandoned </P>
<P>these lands. They are available from the country for the price of </P>
<P>delinquent taxes, which among to $200 per 160 acre sections. If you can </P>
<P>get a company to drill on this established oil land, would you be </P>
<P>interested in my writing you in as a full partner in owning these </P>
<P>various sections. As I stated above, your cost would be negligible. Let </P>
<P>me know at the earliest possible date, and I will exercise the </P>
<P>auctions.</P>
<P>    How are the horses running? I refer to Sir Laurel Guy, the Oakland </P>
<P>owned horse, and the Sacramento owned horse.</P>
<P>    With best personal regards, I remain.</P>
<P>            Sincerely yours,</P>
<P>                                                         R.W. Duke.</P>

<P>    Mr. Flanagan. In the second paragraph of this letter you </P>
<P>say:</P>

<P>    Talent, Ed, is what I want. I am going to make my tour of </P>
<P>the South (incidentally, Nevada and Idaho are good territory) </P>
<P>and make one complete thrust to bring all the talent I possibly </P>
<P>can to Washington.</P>

<P>    What did you mean there?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Could I read the entire letter, and that would </P>
<P>give me a better knowledge than just one paragraph.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. To answer that, it could mean quite a lot of </P>
<P>things. It could mean cases on television. At that time there </P>
<P>were a lot of applications from Oregon for television stations, </P>
<P>and in fact, I understand this letter states there were twenty-</P>
<P>three. It could mean most anything, it actually could, because </P>
<P>we were at that time contemplating going into leasing oil lands </P>
<P>through Oregon and Wyoming. So what it means now, I have no </P>
<P>recollection of.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Does it mean that you would search up cases, </P>
<P>either tax cases or television application cases, or other </P>
<P>cases involving the federal government, and refer those cases </P>
<P>to Edward P. Morgan?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is possible that is what it meant.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Well, does it mean that or doesn't it mean </P>
<P>that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. For me to say yes now, I can't bring my mind </P>
<P>back----</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Do you think it means that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is possible that it does.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you have any arrangement with Morgan that </P>
<P>you would, as you say, bird-dog cases for him out in the West?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Only in this respect: I had told him when I met </P>
<P>him and found out that he was specialized in television, and he </P>
<P>was specialized in tax cases, and he had taught taxes at one </P>
<P>time, I told him that I had a lot of people out on the coast </P>
<P>that approached me on cases, and would he be interested if I </P>
<P>would send these cases to him; and he told me that he would </P>
<P>have to talk to the attorneys, or to the clients of these </P>
<P>people, and go into the matter of the case, and then he would </P>
<P>determine after discussing it with the client and with the </P>
<P>attorney whether he would take the case.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. What would you get out of such an </P>
<P>arrangement?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Well, if I ran across a case like that, I would </P>
<P>try to sell my services as a public relations to him.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you have any arrangement, directly or </P>
<P>indirectly, with Morgan whereby you would get a forwarding fee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, none whatsoever.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever have a discussion with Mr. </P>
<P>Morgan in which he was going to set up a West Coast law office </P>
<P>to handle some of these cases?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I didn't have the discussion. Mr. Morgan stated </P>
<P>at one time that there was a tremendous possibility for another </P>
<P>legal office on the West Coast, because there were various </P>
<P>attorneys here that had opened branches on the coast, and he </P>
<P>was contemplating doing the same thing on the coast.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever obtain any money from Morgan?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I borrowed some money from him, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. On how many occasions did you borrow money?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I only borrowed money from him one time.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. When was that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. How much?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It was $500.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did he pay you by check or by cash?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. He gave me a check.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you sign any note or other evidence of </P>
<P>the debt?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I think I did, I am not sure.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you pay it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I haven't had a chance.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Is that the only occasion on which you got </P>
<P>money from Morgan or his firm?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Either directly or indirectly?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever pay any money to Morgan or his </P>
<P>firm, either directly or indirectly?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Indirectly, these clients that came there would </P>
<P>be indirectly.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. I mean you, yourself.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not to my knowledge.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever split any fees with Morgan?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, I never split any fees with Ed Morgan.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. You never had a referral fee from him?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever send him a referral fee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, not to my knowledge, I never sent him any </P>
<P>money.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. You have read this letter of September 10?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I have.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. I notice in the second to last paragraph it </P>
<P>reads as follows:</P>

<P>    How are the horses running? I refer to Sir Laurel Guy, the </P>
<P>Oakland owned horse, and the Sacramento owned horse.</P>

<P>    What are you talking about there?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That again, I am not sure of. Right now I </P>
<P>couldn't answer it. It might have been Sir Laurel Guy is a </P>
<P>horse owned now by Senator Morse and it was shown here, and </P>
<P>there is a Barbara Hunt in Sacramento that has a horse shown </P>
<P>here, and I could have been referring to that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. You say that Senator Morse at that time owned </P>
<P>a horse named Sir Laurel Guy, a show horse?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. A show horse, and he just got through purchasing </P>
<P>it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Was it from Oakland?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I am not sure whether it was or not. Now I am </P>
<P>not. At that time I possibly could have been.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Is this reference to Sir Laurel Guy in fact a </P>
<P>reference to the Guy Schafer tax case in Oakland?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not to my knowledge.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Is it possible that it is a reference to </P>
<P>that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It could be possible.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Is it possible that your reference to a </P>
<P>Sacramento horse is in fact a reference to the Noble Wilcoxon </P>
<P>tax case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It could be possible.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Do you mean to tell us that you can't recall </P>
<P>whether you are talking about a horse or a tax case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I can't at this time, no.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever have any discussion with Morgan </P>
<P>that you would refer to tax cases by the name of a horse?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. You never had any such discussion?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is why I don't recall what that is in </P>
<P>reference to at this time.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Did I understand you to say you do not know </P>
<P>whether you are talking about a horse or a tax case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall right now.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. You do not know?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't. If I might enlarge, Senator, this might </P>
<P>sound asinine, but it is factual, and the doctors will verify </P>
<P>it. I was in quite an explosion some time ago, and I have a </P>
<P>malignancy in the upper antrum; and in feeding me Acth at the </P>
<P>time of the explosion, the second and third degree burns, that </P>
<P>has affected me, it really has affected my thinking, and there </P>
<P>are a lot of things that I can go through there, and it takes </P>
<P>me probably quite a few hours to refresh my memory on it.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. Why would you be talking about horses when </P>
<P>you are writing a letter to an attorney who has nothing to do </P>
<P>with horses?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Well, we were rather friends, and we discussed </P>
<P>horses, and we discussed a lot of things together.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. What else?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall. It could have been horses or </P>
<P>taxes or oil or it could have been hay or anything.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. How long have you been a friend of </P>
<P>Morgan's?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall what year I had met him, but I had </P>
<P>met him----</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. About when?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Again, I wouldn't be able to tell you until I </P>
<P>would----</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. Well, ten years ago, or what?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I think probably five or six years ago, and I </P>
<P>don't recall.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. You were quite intimate with him?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. We got very intimate.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. You have been to his house?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. Made a lot of trips here to Washington?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I sure did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever go to the horse races?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No. I never have been to a horse race--yes, one </P>
<P>time in my life.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Do you know anything about horses?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes, I know a lot. I was in the 15th Field </P>
<P>Artillery. I ought to know about horses.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. I notice in the letter you ask, ``How are the </P>
<P>horses running?'' And you testified a few minutes ago that Sir </P>
<P>Laurel Guy was a show horse.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. He is a show horse.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. What would a show horse be doing running?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. He has to run. They run him in a saddle, and then </P>
<P>they run him behind a cart, or the show carts, and the entire </P>
<P>prize is predicated on how the horse conducts himself wherever </P>
<P>he is running.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Who owned the show horses?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Senator Morse owned Sir Laurel Guy at that time.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. At that time?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes, at that time. And I think he just about </P>
<P>purchased him about that time.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Are you sure of that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I am not sure of that, but if my memory serves me </P>
<P>right, it was about that time that he probably purchased the </P>
<P>horse.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. You must have had some discussion with Morgan </P>
<P>about Senator Morse's show horses.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I probably did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Was Ed Morgan a friend of Senator Morse?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes, he became a friend of Senator Morse.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you introduce him to Senator Morse?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. When?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Again, I don't recall. A couple of years ago.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Sometime in 1948, '49, possibly?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall what specific year, or time.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Under what circumstances did you introduce </P>
<P>him to Senator Morse?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Well, I might be mistaken in this, and I have got </P>
<P>to be sure. I think that Senator Morse spoke before the FBI </P>
<P>graduating class, and I think Mr. Morgan wanted to meet him at </P>
<P>that time.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. At that time, was Morgan a bureau agent or a </P>
<P>lawyer?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, he was a lawyer, but he still was very </P>
<P>intimate about a lot of the members of the Federal Bureau of </P>
<P>Investigation.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. I am curious about the ``talent'' you mention </P>
<P>in the letter. You say you were going to round up ``talent'' </P>
<P>and bring it to Washington.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Again, I have to answer, I don't recall, at this </P>
<P>time what I was referring to.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Do you have any idea what it was?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It could have been oil leases. There were a lot </P>
<P>of them available in that area; and it could have been cases, </P>
<P>and it could have been most anything, and I really don't recall </P>
<P>what I was referring to.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. At least you were not referring to talent in </P>
<P>the accepted sense of the word?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. You were using that as a code word?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I mean my expression, and I expressed myself </P>
<P>probably a lot of ways.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Could you tell us why, in a letter of that </P>
<P>kind, instead of saying ``talent'' if you mean oil leases, you </P>
<P>would not say ``oil leases,'' and if you mean television cases </P>
<P>you would not say ``television cases?''</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I notice in that letter that I refer to </P>
<P>television cases.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. And you also refer to oil matters.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. And you called it oil lands, and you didn't </P>
<P>call it talent.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. As far as the Noble Wilcoxon case and the Schafer </P>
<P>case are concerned, I am sure that those cases he already had, </P>
<P>and I don't think I would have any reason to be referring in </P>
<P>any code to him regarding those cases.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Could I ask you this question: When you went </P>
<P>out and solicited tax cases, where would you get your </P>
<P>information about the case to begin with?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Again, as I say, to the best of my knowledge, </P>
<P>from various accounting firms, from attorneys on the West </P>
<P>Coast, and I knew quite a number of attorneys.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Sometimes attorneys would contact you and </P>
<P>tell you about a tax case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That they probably had, and they wanted to </P>
<P>associate with some counsel in Washington, and they knew that I </P>
<P>was here quite often, and they wanted to know if I knew of any </P>
<P>competent firms.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Let us stick, now, to the cases that you </P>
<P>solicited personally, cases where there was no lawyer in the </P>
<P>case. Did any lawyer ever tell you about a case before you </P>
<P>solicited the case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall right now if they ever have or </P>
<P>not.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Did Morgan ever refer any cases to you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Again, I would have to go through my files to </P>
<P>search pretty thoroughly, and I don't recall whether he did or </P>
<P>not.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. You do not remember whether he did or not?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, I don't. You see, Senator, it might sound </P>
<P>asinine to you gentlemen here, but I was in a very diversified </P>
<P>line of business, and I met quite a number of people, and I </P>
<P>actually have. To recall things now, I might be able to in some </P>
<P>instances.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Have you seen Mr. Morgan since you have been </P>
<P>in Washington on this trip?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Have you called him?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. When was the last time you saw Ed Morgan?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Again, I don't remember. It was a couple of years </P>
<P>ago, I guess, maybe a year ago or maybe a couple of years ago.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Do you recall any case now where Morgan or </P>
<P>any other Washington attorney got the information on a tax </P>
<P>case, and referred it to you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall, I really don't; and it is </P>
<P>possible, but I couldn't say. He might have, and there is a </P>
<P>possibility that he gave me some; and I could say, I did say </P>
<P>this before, before the jury, I am not sure. They asked me, and </P>
<P>I think that I told them yes, that some of these cases I did </P>
<P>get, but I honestly--and you are asking me to be candid with </P>
<P>you--I honestly don't remember, and I don't want to injure or </P>
<P>impugn anybody's character about this by letting my imagination </P>
<P>run away with me and say yes, they did, when I am not sure.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. You did tell the grand jury?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is possible I did, and I am not sure whether I </P>
<P>did or not.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. You do not remember now that you told the </P>
<P>grand jury that cases had been referred to you by Washington </P>
<P>attorneys?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I might have told the jury that, and I might have </P>
<P>told the King committee that, but at that time--I want you </P>
<P>gentlemen to understand it is no alibi--I was a pretty sick </P>
<P>person when I appeared before both bodies, and I lost sixty </P>
<P>pounds in about fourteen days.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. I have here a letter, a copy of a letter </P>
<P>dated September 5, 1949, addressed to Welch, Mott &amp; Morgan, </P>
<P>opening, ``Dear Ed,'' and signed by typewriter, ``Russell W. </P>
<P>Duke.'' I notice on page two of this letter, at the top of the </P>
<P>page, you state:</P>

<P>    Ed, I have a lot of cases in California that I have to do a </P>
<P>lot of bird-dogging on, and I hate like sin to go down there </P>
<P>and bird-dog without clicking on a few. I wish that you would </P>
<P>be able to secure some talent as I could use some hay.</P>

<P>    What are you talking about there?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Again, I don't recall; it might be cases and it </P>
<P>might not be.</P>
<P>    [The letter referred to was marked as committee's Exhibit </P>
<P>No. 2, R. W. Duke, January 15, 1953, and is as follows:]</P>

<P>                                       Portland, 13 Oregon,</P>
<P>                                                 September 5, 1949.</P>
<P>Welsh, Mott &amp; Morgan,</P>
<P>710 Erickson Building, Fourteenth Northwest,</P>
<P>Washington, DC.</P>
<P>    Dear Ed: I was up to see Mr. Braman, as I told you over the phone </P>
<P>today, and I received the information which I am passing on to you. The </P>
<P>patent was originally issued on October 6, 1936, Patent No. 2056165, </P>
<P>and then it was re-issued December 14, 1948, Reissue No. 23058, issued </P>
<P>to Louis J. Bronaugh, of Portland, and Thomas I. Potter, of New York. </P>
<P>The attorney in the case is Richard S. Temko. Louis J. Bronaugh is a </P>
<P>Portland attorney. I shall try to get in touch with him and learn all I </P>
<P>possibly can regarding the reissue. However, it is my understanding </P>
<P>that Potter had put the patents on the refrigerator and a patent for a </P>
<P>pump as his collateral to the Refrigeration Patent Corporation, and he </P>
<P>had no authority to have the patent reissued exclusively to himself. </P>
<P>However, he has accomplished having the patents reissued, as I have </P>
<P>stated above. Mr. Braman has written Mr. Potter a letter and is </P>
<P>awaiting the reply; and as soon as he receives Mr. Potter's reply, he </P>
<P>is then going to retain your firm by paying the $2000 down and the </P>
<P>percentage of the property. I tried to get myself retained as a public </P>
<P>relations agent; however, I had a logical argument against it by saying </P>
<P>if he retains a public relations agent on investigation and retains </P>
<P>attorneys, the cost would probably cause the other stockholders to back </P>
<P>down from going ahead in the suit, so will have to hold to the original </P>
<P>agreement. I will participate in the monies that you get; however, I </P>
<P>don't worry about that because we can always work something out </P>
<P>satisfactory to all concerned.</P>
<P>    Ed, I have a lot of cases in California that I have to do a lot of </P>
<P>bird-dogging on, and I hate like sin to go down there and bird-dog </P>
<P>without clicking on a few. I wish that you would be able to secure some </P>
<P>talent as I could use some hay. I am letting things quiet down on the </P>
<P>coast by lying dormant and putting more effort in lining up the coming </P>
<P>campaign. I assure you that the request you made of me on the phone </P>
<P>that Senator Morse will go along 100 percent, because the longer you </P>
<P>get to know him, the more you will learn that he is a man of his word; </P>
<P>but he has had so much to do, and, as I understand, he has been given </P>
<P>assurance that you are number one on the list. In all the time I have </P>
<P>known Senator Morse, I have never known him to deviate or to say </P>
<P>something that is not so. He either tells you in the beginning nothing </P>
<P>doing, or he will go along. I am willing to gamble with you in any </P>
<P>shape, form, or manner that you will be in as soon as the other chap </P>
<P>resigns. I sincerely hope that the cases that are back there clear up </P>
<P>so that we can start on something else. Again I repeat, ``I can use the </P>
<P>hay.''</P>
<P>    Howard has received an appointment as a commissioner on the city </P>
<P>Boxing Commission. The job is gratis; however, it takes up a tremendous </P>
<P>amount of his time. He also was appointed on a commission of 22 </P>
<P>attorneys to study revising the city charter. That, also, is gratis. </P>
<P>Plus his fishing, his handball, and his Oregon Medical Association's </P>
<P>work, the good Lord only knows how he does it all. However, he gets by. </P>
<P>He is in the best of health; and I am sure that if I told him I was </P>
<P>writing you, he would tell me to say ``hello.''</P>
<P>    I conveyed to Mr. Braman that urgency in this particular case was </P>
<P>all important. Mr. Braman said that within three weeks time he would </P>
<P>call me and be ready to retain your firm. As I told you over the phone, </P>
<P>Mr. Mott talked to him on the phone the day before he was there; and </P>
<P>Braman is very much impressed by Mott and your firm. Senator Morse gave </P>
<P>you a big send-off when Braman had asked him as to what type of firm </P>
<P>and people you are. If you ever read the letter that Braman received </P>
<P>from Senator Morse, you will have to look into the mirror to see if </P>
<P>you're the same individual because, Ed, he really boosted you very, </P>
<P>very high.</P>
<P>    As you know, the talent is plentiful, and it is a psychological </P>
<P>effect when one comes in cold and tells a person what he knows about </P>
<P>him, so I hope sincerely that you will be able to secure some talent </P>
<P>for me.</P>
<P>    With best wishes to you, Welsh and Mott, I remain,</P>
<P>            Sincerely,</P>
<P>                                                   Russell W. Duke.</P>

<P>    Mr. Flanagan. It is quite likely that you were talking </P>
<P>about cases?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is possible.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. When you are referring to ``talent''?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is possible.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. When you were talking about ``hay,'' is that </P>
<P>money?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes, sir.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. You weren't talking about hay for these </P>
<P>horses?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    Senator Potter. What else could ``talent'' mean in that </P>
<P>sentence?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall at this time. Could I read the </P>
<P>letter, and I could probably tell you.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. It is a rather long letter. Go ahead and read </P>
<P>it if you wish.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Again, I will have to tell you that I really </P>
<P>don't recall what that referred to, and it could have been </P>
<P>cases and it could have been most anything.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. I refer to the last page of this letter, page </P>
<P>three, the second paragraph:</P>

<P>    As you know, the talent is plentiful, and it is a </P>
<P>psychological effect when one comes in cold and tells a person </P>
<P>what he knows about him, so I hope sincerely that you will be </P>
<P>able to secure some talent for me.</P>

<P>    Mr. Duke. What year was that again?</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. It is September 5, 1949. Do you know what you </P>
<P>meant by that statement?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, I don't.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. When you say that ``it is a psychological </P>
<P>effect when one comes in cold and tells a person what he knows </P>
<P>about him,'' you are in fact referring to the fact if you come </P>
<P>in with information on a man's tax case and start telling him </P>
<P>about it, you are in a much better position to got yourself </P>
<P>hired as public relations counsel?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is possible, but I wouldn't say yes or I </P>
<P>wouldn't say no.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Then it is possible, you say, that what you </P>
<P>are referring to here is that it is very helpful to you if you </P>
<P>can go in to a taxpayer or his lawyer and tell him some of the </P>
<P>facts of the case, is that correct?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I wouldn't say that that refers to that, no.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. You say it is possible?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is possible. Anything could be possible.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Where would you get information on a tax </P>
<P>case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Usually from the client or from the attorney.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. No, you are talking about ``going in cold.''</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Well, I might not be referring to that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. And telling a person.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I might not be referring to a tax case.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Are you in fact indicating here that you can </P>
<P>get information from some government source, either Justice or </P>
<P>the Internal Revenue Bureau, and go in and tell the client </P>
<P>about it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I never got any information from the Internal </P>
<P>Revenue Bureau or the Department of Justice.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you get any indirectly from Justice or </P>
<P>the Internal Revenue Bureau, here or in the field?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Indirectly, yes, from the client or from the </P>
<P>client's attorney.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever ask Ed Morgan to go to the </P>
<P>Justice Department, the Internal Revenue Bureau, or any other </P>
<P>government agency, and get information in connection with a tax </P>
<P>case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Other than I did in that Burns case. I didn't </P>
<P>tell him where to go, and I asked him if he could get any </P>
<P>information regarding the case.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did Morgan ever tell you--and I want you to </P>
<P>consider this question carefully--did Morgan ever tell you that </P>
<P>he had contacts in the Justice Department or Internal Revenue </P>
<P>Bureau where he could get confidential information concerning </P>
<P>tax cases?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't know. You are wording it in such a way--</P>
<P>--</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. I will reword it. Did Morgan, Edward P. </P>
<P>Morgan, ever tell you that he had contacts in the Department of </P>
<P>Justice where he could get confidential information about tax </P>
<P>cases?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Well, I will answer it this way: He probably told </P>
<P>me that he was in the Justice Department for eight and a half </P>
<P>or nine years, and he knew his way and knew the handling and </P>
<P>the federal procedure of handling cases in the Justice </P>
<P>Department.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. I did not ask that question, Mr. Duke, and I </P>
<P>will ask it again. Did Morgan ever tell you that he had ways </P>
<P>and means to get confidential information from the Justice </P>
<P>Department concerning tax cases?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not that I remember.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Is it possible that he told you that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I doubt it, and I don't think a person with his </P>
<P>mentality would make a statement like that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did Morgan ever tell you that he had ways and </P>
<P>means to get confidential information from the Internal Revenue </P>
<P>Bureau concerning tax cases?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall him ever making a statement like </P>
<P>that to me.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did Morgan ever get information for you other </P>
<P>than his efforts in the Inez Burns case, from either Justice or </P>
<P>Internal Revenue?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't know where he would get the information, </P>
<P>but if I ever wrote him a letter, I would ask him to get </P>
<P>whatever information he could pertaining to the particular </P>
<P>case, for the attorney out there.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Would he do that, or did he ever do that </P>
<P>before he was actually retained as counsel?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not to my knowledge.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. He would only do that after he would be </P>
<P>retained?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Now, wait a minute. In the Inez Burns case, he </P>
<P>was never retained, but he made an effort to get some </P>
<P>information; but whether he went to Justice or where he went, I </P>
<P>am inclined to believe that any information he would get, he </P>
<P>would legally try to secure it from the proper source.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever ask him to get information in </P>
<P>tax cases before he was actually retained as counsel, other </P>
<P>than the Burns case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not that I recall. It is possible in other cases </P>
<P>like the Burns case, too. I don't recall.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. I will refer to the letter of September 5 on </P>
<P>page two. Mr. Duke:</P>

<P>    I assure you that the request you made of me on the phone </P>
<P>that Senator Morse will go along 100 per cent, because the </P>
<P>longer you get to know him, the more you will learn that he is </P>
<P>a man of his word, but he has had so much to do, and, as I </P>
<P>understand, he has been given assurance that you are number one </P>
<P>on the list.</P>

<P>    What are you talking about?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't know for sure, but I think--does that go </P>
<P>on? I think that I read that letter, didn't I?</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Does that go on to say that someone was going to </P>
<P>resign from a position?</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Yes. I will read it for you:</P>

<P>    In all the time I have known Senator Morse, I have never </P>
<P>known him to deviate or to say something that is not so. He </P>
<P>either, tells you in the beginning nothing doing, or he will go </P>
<P>along. I am willing to gamble with you in any shape, form, or </P>
<P>manner that you will be in as soon as the other chap resigns.</P>

<P>    Mr. Duke. I think that that wasn't only Senator Morse. I </P>
<P>think there were quite a few senators. This Mr. McCoy was going </P>
<P>to resign from the FCC, and Mr. Morgan, having his experience </P>
<P>and knowledge of FCC and television work, I think made </P>
<P>application for that position.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you talk to Senator Morse on behalf of </P>
<P>Morgan's candidacy as an FCC commissioner?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever assist or attempt to assist </P>
<P>Morgan in getting any other federal jobs?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Which jobs?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I assisted, and I don't know, the Tydings </P>
<P>committee----</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. What did you do on his behalf so he got to be </P>
<P>counsel to the Tydings committee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I talked to several senators that I knew, </P>
<P>including Senator Morse, to see if it was possible to get him </P>
<P>on that committee; and also on this OPS.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. When he was made national director of </P>
<P>enforcement for OPS?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. He was made chief counsel, wasn't it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Inspector of enforcement.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes, sir.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. What did you do on his behalf for that job?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I talked to various senators and congressman to </P>
<P>see if I couldn't get him on that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Who are the senators you talked to?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall. I think probably Senator Kilgore, </P>
<P>Senator Morse--again, I don't recall who all I talked to; </P>
<P>whoever had anything to do with the committee or those </P>
<P>positions.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever know Eric Ellis from Portland, </P>
<P>Oregon?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I didn't know him; I met him.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever meet his attorney, Mr. George </P>
<P>Bronaugh?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes, I met them both.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Mr. Ellis owned the restaurant known as Mr. </P>
<P>Jones' Restaurants, didn't he, in Portland?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right,</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. To your knowledge, did Mr. Eric Ellis have </P>
<P>tax problems back in 1950?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Well, now, I will have to answer that for you and </P>
<P>it won't take much time but it will have to be answered </P>
<P>properly.</P>
<P>    I had an accountant, and his name was Lester Talbott, who </P>
<P>used to be in the Internal Revenue Department.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Where is he from?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Portland, Oregon. And it seems that this Eric </P>
<P>Ellis was employed by a rancher or manufacturer in Tacoma or </P>
<P>Spokane, Washington, and the Internal Revenue Department, in </P>
<P>investigating this employer of Eric Ellis, found a discrepancy </P>
<P>in his accounts. And Ellis was the bookkeeper or the </P>
<P>accountant. Then he made an open deal with the Internal Revenue </P>
<P>Department that if he would testify against his employer----</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Who was the employer in this case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke [continuing]. I don't recall. There are records of </P>
<P>it; Talbott has them.</P>
<P>    That if he would testify against his employer, he wouldn't </P>
<P>have to file any income tax returns for the next few years. And </P>
<P>Eric Ellis didn't file any returns for the next few years.</P>
<P>    So one day Ellis called me at my home and told my wife that </P>
<P>as soon as I came in to come down to see him. And so I called </P>
<P>Talbott and asked Talbott if he knew Ellis, and he said yes. He </P>
<P>told me the story about Ellis. So I went down to see Mr. EIlis </P>
<P>in his restaurant, and he asked me if I could do him any good </P>
<P>or give him any help on his case. And I already had all of the </P>
<P>knowledge and information, and I wanted him to tell me, and so </P>
<P>he told me about it. I said, ``The best thing you can do is to </P>
<P>go to the Internal Revenue Department and tell them how much </P>
<P>you owe, and tell them you haven't filed returns for the past </P>
<P>four or five years, and get out of it the best you can.''</P>
<P>    So the next day he called me again and asked me to meet </P>
<P>with him and his attorney in another restaurant that he owned </P>
<P>and so we went there. They proceeded to get a fifth of whiskey </P>
<P>and start plying me with whisky and kept asking me who in the </P>
<P>Internal Revenue Department in Portland was aiding in these tax </P>
<P>cases. I told them it was asinine in questioning me on that, </P>
<P>and you</P>

<P>couldn't get me drunk on it, and that as far as their problem </P>
<P>was concerned the best thing he could do was go ahead and </P>
<P>settle with Internal Revenue Department themselves. I left them </P>
<P>with that, and I haven't seen them since, and I understand the </P>
<P>case was settled for about $4,000.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. This second meeting that you had, with Mr. </P>
<P>Ellis, you say his attorney, George Bronaugh, was present?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes, sir.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Who else was in the room besides yourself and </P>
<P>George Bronaugh and this man?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is all.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. At Mr. Jones' Restaurant?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. They were all called that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. This was the one on International Avenue?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not on International Avenue.</P>
<P>    Mr Flanagan. The one on Sandy Avenue?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No. It was on Interstate Avenue.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Interstate Avenue?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes, sir.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. At that time, did you try to prevail upon </P>
<P>either Mr. Ellis or his attorney to hire you as public </P>
<P>relations counsel?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, indeed.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you have any discussions about the fact </P>
<P>that you might be their public relations counsel?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, indeed. They were trying to retain me, and I </P>
<P>refused, because I already knew the entire story on Ellis, and </P>
<P>I didn't want to have anything to do with Ellis.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. At that conversation in Mr. Jones' </P>
<P>Restaurant, the only one you say you ever had with Ellis and </P>
<P>Bronaugh concerning their tax matters----</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan [continuing]. Did you tell them, either </P>
<P>directly or indirectly, that you could secure confidential </P>
<P>information?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, sir. They were questioning me on that to see </P>
<P>if I could, and I told them not.</P>
<P>    Incidentally, the same day I called up the Internal Revenue </P>
<P>Department and gave them that very information, that these two </P>
<P>men were questioning me on that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you at that time tell them that you could </P>
<P>get information out of the Justice Department or the Bureau of </P>
<P>Internal Revenue?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Absolutely, I did not. I would never make a </P>
<P>statement that I could get information from Justice or the </P>
<P>Internal Revenue, because it is impossible to do so.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you at that meeting in that restaurant </P>
<P>with Ellis and Bronaugh, tell them, either directly or </P>
<P>indirectly, that you could offer your services as a public </P>
<P>relations agent on a monthly fee basis?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, I told them how I operated.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. But did you offer your services to Mr. Ellis </P>
<P>or to his attorney?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not to my knowledge did I ever offer my services </P>
<P>to either one of those gentlemen.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Are you quite sure that you didn't offer your </P>
<P>services to those gentlemen?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Well, I will answer it this way: By the time we </P>
<P>hit that first fifth and the second fifth, no one knew what </P>
<P>they were talking about, and----</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Just a moment. A few moments ago you said </P>
<P>that, as I recall your testimony, after you left this meeting </P>
<P>you went to the Bureau of Internal Revenue and told them.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Were you still drunk?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No. I am telling you they tried to get me drunk, </P>
<P>but they were plenty drunk.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. But you weren't?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I was feeling ``high,'' but I wasn't drunk.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. You knew what you were doing and what you </P>
<P>were saying?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I certainly did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you tell these men, either directly or </P>
<P>indirectly, that you could follow through with various offices </P>
<P>where their case might be, their tax case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Their case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That would be impossible, and again I will have </P>
<P>to answer it this way: The case was already set, and it was </P>
<P>already set for them to adjust the case, and the deal was </P>
<P>already made with the Internal Revenue Department by </P>
<P>themselves, to adjust the case in Seattle, and they didn't </P>
<P>require anybody's help.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever tell these gentlemen at that </P>
<P>time at that meeting that you could follow other cases through </P>
<P>the various departments?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I wouldn't discuss any other cases with them.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. I do not believe you have answered that </P>
<P>question.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you in fact tell them that you had </P>
<P>followed other cases or could follow them through the various </P>
<P>departments of government?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I possibly did, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you or didn't you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you tell them that tax cases could be </P>
<P>killed in the Department of Justice by you or people that you </P>
<P>knew?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No. That I would emphatically deny.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you tell them, either directly or </P>
<P>indirectly, that through certain contacts that you might have, </P>
<P>that you could stop cases in the Department of Justice?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I wouldn't make no such statement, no.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever state, either directly or </P>
<P>indirectly, that you could stop or fix tax cases at any place </P>
<P>in the government?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Nowhere would I make a statement like that, that </P>
<P>I could fix tax cases.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you make any such statement to these </P>
<P>gentlemen at that time?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, I did not.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Can you go back three questions and read </P>
<P>that?</P>
<P>    [The record was read by the reporter.]</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Does that mean you did not make such a </P>
<P>statement?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not to my knowledge did I ever make such a </P>
<P>statement, no.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you state, either directly or indirectly, </P>
<P>to those gentlemen, that is, Ellis and Bronaugh, or did you </P>
<P>intimate to them, that if their tax case went to the Justice </P>
<P>Department that they would have to hire any certain Washington </P>
<P>attorney?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Mr. Flanagan, if I might state--and this </P>
<P>committee should know this--there was an attempt made to entrap </P>
<P>me by those two gentlemen, and I had information, and I have </P>
<P>Mr. Talbott to testify to that. I was told that Ellis was going </P>
<P>to try to entrap me. You are asking me a lot of questions </P>
<P>pertaining to these two gentlemen, and I told you that I knew </P>
<P>their efforts were to try to trap me, and when I went to talk </P>
<P>to these gentlemen I spent the first evening, I spent about ten </P>
<P>minutes with Mr. Ellis in his restaurant, and left him, and </P>
<P>told him I couldn't do anything for him, and absolutely left </P>
<P>him, and the next day they called again and asked me to meet </P>
<P>him, and I met him there, and I asked him what he wanted, and </P>
<P>he said he wanted to talk to me about something else beside the </P>
<P>tax case. And I met him there, and I met the other gentleman, </P>
<P>and he never introduced me to the other gentleman as being an </P>
<P>attorney, and he brought out a fifth of whisky, and said ``Have </P>
<P>a drink.'' And I said, ``Sure, I will.'' And I let them drink </P>
<P>theirs first, and we kept on visiting and talking and nothing </P>
<P>else. And then they started asking me a lot of questions, and I </P>
<P>started telling them, and I said, ``Look, I am not answering </P>
<P>anything like that.'' I knew what they were wanting, and I knew </P>
<P>they were trying to frame me, because he was already involved </P>
<P>in one frame of his employer, and, now, if these men have given </P>
<P>a statement and they would swear that I made such statements, </P>
<P>and I sit here and say no, and, these men swear that I did make </P>
<P>such statements, here I am being framed by a man that framed or </P>
<P>helped frame another man.</P>
<P>    Senator Potter. Is that what you mean by being framed?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. They tried to entrap me into statements or into a </P>
<P>deal in order to involve me in tax matters, because Ellis was </P>
<P>sore at Talbott, and Talbott used to be his accountant, and </P>
<P>after Talbott found out what he had done, and what he had done </P>
<P>in Spokane with his former employer, he and Talbott got very </P>
<P>bitter.</P>
<P>    Senator Potter. Why would they go out of their way to frame </P>
<P>you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. After all, I can say this, without being </P>
<P>egotistical, because I learned a long time ago that ego is an </P>
<P>anesthesia provided by nature to deaden the pain of a damned </P>
<P>fool, and I don't want to be placed in that category, but </P>
<P>politically I was pretty big in Oregon, and there were many </P>
<P>efforts made to discredit me in Oregon.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. You were pretty big politically?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. What is that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I have been in labor and I have for quite a long </P>
<P>time controlled--headed one of the largest locals in the United </P>
<P>States.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. Controlled it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, I headed it. I didn't control it.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. What local was that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Local 72 of the Boilermakers, AFL.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. You were president of it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. Where did you control it from?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I withdrew that word ``control'' and I said----</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. Where did you head it from, in what </P>
<P>capacity?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. On the committee, the executive committee.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. You controlled the committee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I didn't say ``control.'' I withdrew that.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. What did you head?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I headed the Boilermakers Local.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. President of it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, I wasn't president of it, and we had no </P>
<P>president. And we had a lawsuit and we had rather a bitter </P>
<P>fight about two or three years and we finally got rid of the </P>
<P>president and the business agent, and we operated the local </P>
<P>from a committee.</P>
<P>    Senator Potter. Then if you were active politically, these </P>
<P>people must have assumed that you could use political influence </P>
<P>for tax adjustments.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, sir, those people were maneuvering for </P>
<P>someone else.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Mr. Duke, I would still like to pursue this </P>
<P>question further and get a categorical answer from you if I </P>
<P>could. I will rephrase my question.</P>
<P>    At this meeting with Ellis and his attorney, Bronaugh, in </P>
<P>that restaurant on that day, did you state, directly or </P>
<P>indirectly, if the Ellis case went to the Justice Department </P>
<P>they should hire a lawyer in Washington by the name of Morgan, </P>
<P>or any other lawyer?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is possible I might have told them that, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you recommend Morgan to them as a lawyer?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is possible that I might have. What year was </P>
<P>that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. 1950.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. The whole thing is wrong. I didn't meet him until </P>
<P>1949, and in 1950 he was broke and he was out of the restaurant </P>
<P>business.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. You now state that when you had this meeting, </P>
<P>whether it be in 1949 or 1950, the only meeting you say you </P>
<P>ever had with Ellis and his attorney, you now state that you </P>
<P>did not indicate that if their case went to Justice and they </P>
<P>would have to hire a Washington lawyer?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Repeat that again.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you state at that meeting that these </P>
<P>gentlemen would have to hire a Washington lawyer?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I told you I don't recall anything that was </P>
<P>stated at that meeting.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you indicate to them that if their case </P>
<P>got to the Justice Department, they would have to get Ed Morgan </P>
<P>or else they would lose that case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall making any such statement.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you state to them or indicate to them </P>
<P>that they would have to hire Morgan if their case went to </P>
<P>Justice so that they could be sure to win their case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Again, I could not answer directly or indirectly </P>
<P>because I don't recall.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. You have no recollection of what you said?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, I don't. Three years ago, was that, and I </P>
<P>talked to quite a number of people.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you report to the Internal Revenue </P>
<P>Department that day that you went to them?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I certainly did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. What did you tell them?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I just told them of the meeting, and what took </P>
<P>place at the meeting, and who was there.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you tell them anything about the fact </P>
<P>that Morgan may have to be hired in these cases?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you think, in fact, that it was necessary </P>
<P>to hire Morgan in Justice Department cases?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't know why. There are other competent </P>
<P>attorneys here that are probably just as capable.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you recommend Morgan as an attorney to </P>
<P>Ellis or Bronaugh?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is possible, and I don't recall.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Now, your testimony here is very confusing. </P>
<P>First of all, you say that you recommended nothing to them; and </P>
<P>now I ask you, did you or did you not recommend Morgan?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I didn't say that I didn't recommend anything to </P>
<P>them. It is possible that I recommended Morgan, and I don't </P>
<P>recall.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did Morgan contact you at that restaurant </P>
<P>when you were there?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did he call you on the telephone?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. He wouldn't know to call me. How would he know to </P>
<P>call me at a restaurant? He would call me at my home.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Who did you contact in the Bureau of Internal </P>
<P>Revenue to give these facts to?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall. It might have been, someone in </P>
<P>the intelligence unit.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. In Portland?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever handle any cases involving </P>
<P>claims against the government?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Claims bills pending in Congress?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't get that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Bills for claims against the government that </P>
<P>were in the Congress?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever receive any money from any </P>
<P>persons or any firm to assist them in putting their claims </P>
<P>bills through the Congress?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. In this way: Every time I had to come back here, </P>
<P>they paid my fare and expenses.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you come back here to promote their </P>
<P>claims through the Congress?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, not at first.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Well, at the last, did you; at any time did </P>
<P>you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. After the bill was introduced in the Congress I </P>
<P>had to come back here and appear before the various committees </P>
<P>to try to get the bills through.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you discuss this bill with any members of </P>
<P>the House or the Senate?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Who were your clients in that case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Herman Lawson, and Nelson Company.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Was American Terrazzo Company one of your </P>
<P>clients?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you go to American Terrazzo and attempt </P>
<P>to get them to hire you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you discuss this case with anyone </P>
<P>connected with American Terrazzo?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. With whom?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I do not recall at the moment. Mr. Nelson and Mr. </P>
<P>Brace of both companies were putting up the money, and had </P>
<P>already spent quite a lot of money on this before I ever </P>
<P>entered into this, and I know Brace and Nelson, we have been </P>
<P>very close friends for a number of years, and I knew about this </P>
<P>case.</P>
<P>    They were getting tired of spending their money for it, and </P>
<P>I asked them what they were doing on it, and they told me, and </P>
<P>I said, ``The best thing you can do with this case is to go </P>
<P>right directly to the federal works or Public Works </P>
<P>Administration and get to the chief counsel and discuss the </P>
<P>case with him, and find out how far you can go with it.''</P>
<P>    Well, they told me to go ahead and try it. They paid my </P>
<P>expenses, and we came out here, and I met with the chief </P>
<P>counsel of the federal works, or whatever bureau or department </P>
<P>that bill or the claim was against, and discussed the case with </P>
<P>them, and they told me what to do. And in fact, they prepared </P>
<P>the bill, and said that the claim was justifiable and it should </P>
<P>be paid.</P>
<P>    I was just representing Mr. Nelson at the time, and he paid </P>
<P>$500, I think, for my fare, round-trip fare to come out here.</P>
<P>    Then Mr. Frick, who was the chief counsel, stated that the </P>
<P>bill would have to be put into the Congress.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever discuss this case on behalf of </P>
<P>your clients with any member of Congress?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes, I have.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. With whom?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall. Various congressmen.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you discuss it with Senator Morse?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did he introduce a bill after your </P>
<P>discussion?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. He introduced two of them.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. On your behalf?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. We don't want to get Senator Morse involved in </P>
<P>that. I brought Mr. Nelson and Mr. Brace back here, and they </P>
<P>discussed the bill with Senator Morse.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever discuss the bill with Senator </P>
<P>Morse?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes, later on, after he introduced it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. And you were discussing it on behalf of your </P>
<P>clients?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes, sir.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. This was the San Francisco case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Were you at that time registered as a </P>
<P>lobbyist?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No. I inquired about that, and the Justice </P>
<P>Department, or whoever it was in the Justice Department, told </P>
<P>me that as long as it was not--a person couldn't register as a </P>
<P>lobbyist unless he was lobbying to change legislation and laws </P>
<P>of our land. But on a private claim bill, if you visit the </P>
<P>various senators and congressmen to put it through, it was not </P>
<P>classified as lobbying, and it wasn't necessary for me to </P>
<P>register.</P>
<P>    Senator Potter. Who gave you your advice in the Department </P>
<P>of Justice?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall now, and also it was the counsel </P>
<P>for the committee headed up, I think, if I am not mistaken, and </P>
<P>I might be in the name, by Congressman Buchanan, was it? Wasn't </P>
<P>he the chairman of the Lobby committee?</P>
<P>    Senator Potter. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Their chief counsel told me the same thing, so </P>
<P>long as it was not lobbying to change laws of this legislature.</P>
<P>    Senator Potter. Do you recall who your contact was in the </P>
<P>Department of Justice who gave you that information?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I called the Department of Justice and I asked </P>
<P>them--they asked who I wanted to talk to, and I explained, and </P>
<P>then they referred me to whoever it was, and I do not recall.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. Did you go down and see them?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I talked to them on the telephone.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. In connection with this claims case, Mr. </P>
<P>Duke, did you ever, directly or indirectly, indicate to anyone </P>
<P>connected with American Terrazzo that if they didn't hire you </P>
<P>as public relations counsel, you would see that their name </P>
<P>would be taken out of the bills that were then pending?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I did not make that kind of statement. If I can </P>
<P>tell you what happened in that, you will understand it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Nelson and Mr. Brace decided that they were not going </P>
<P>to foot the bills for all of the other people, all of the other </P>
<P>claimants, and so we had a meeting in my room, Mr. Nelson and </P>
<P>Mr. Brace and everybody involved, and they called them to come </P>
<P>in. And I happened to be in San Francisco with Mr. Bobber. They </P>
<P>discussed this case and they told the other claimants that they </P>
<P>would have to proportionately prorate the cost of this bill, </P>
<P>and put up their share of it.</P>
<P>    Senator Potter. What cost of it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Mr. Brace and Mr. Nelson had already spent </P>
<P>several thousands of dollars retaining attorneys and trying to </P>
<P>get the bill through. They advanced my expenses coming out </P>
<P>here, and they felt justifiable that all of these people, that </P>
<P>they should get together and prorate their share.</P>
<P>    Now, I had no fee. If Nelson and Lawson would get their </P>
<P>claim, then they were to pay me.</P>
<P>    Senator Potter. How much?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. We would have settled that later.</P>
<P>    Senator Potter. You took on a job without any amount being </P>
<P>set as to what you would receive?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right, Senator, in this particular case. </P>
<P>We are very close friends, both Mr. Nelson and Mr. Brace and </P>
<P>myself, and we have known each other for a number of years.</P>
<P>    Senator Potter. Who made the first contact with Senator </P>
<P>Morse? Did you make it or did Mr. Nelson and Mr. Brace?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. We all three came out here together, and I took </P>
<P>them in to Senator Morse's office, and they explained to </P>
<P>Senator Morse the predicament they were in, and then Mr. Frick </P>
<P>contacted Senator Morse and wanted to know, and Frick prepared </P>
<P>the bill.</P>
<P>    Senator Potter. What was your $500 round-trip expense </P>
<P>money, where did that come from?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. In the beginning, they paid my fare coming out </P>
<P>here.</P>
<P>    Senator Potter. You mean when you came out together?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you tell Senator Morse that you were </P>
<P>getting a fee or expenses out of this claims case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't think so.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever tell him that you were getting </P>
<P>fees or expenses or acting as public relations counsel in any </P>
<P>tax cases?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't think so, no.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever ask for his assistance in a tax </P>
<P>case, not involving a constituent of his in the State of </P>
<P>Oregon?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not assistance. I would ask him, there was one </P>
<P>particular case that comes to my mind, the L. diMartini case, </P>
<P>where the Internal Revenue Department agent ruled that because </P>
<P>a man conducted his business at the age of ninety, even though </P>
<P>he was active in it, he was not entitled to the salary he was </P>
<P>getting.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Was that a California case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ask Senator Morse to appear in that </P>
<P>or any other case down at the Internal Revenue on behalf of any </P>
<P>of your clients?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't think that I have. I think that Mr. </P>
<P>Kaiser, if I am not mistaken, asked him to.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Who is Mr. Kaiser?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. He is the comptroller and head of the L. </P>
<P>diMartini Company.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. That is a California company?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did Senator Morse ever know you were acting </P>
<P>as public relations counsel for these taxpayers?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't know.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. That he might be contacting Internal Revenue </P>
<P>on behalf of?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I wouldn't know if he did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did you ever tell him you were getting fees </P>
<P>for representing these taxpayers as public relations counsel?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not to my knowledge.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. So, then, you say that he had no knowledge of </P>
<P>the fact?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I wouldn't say that, whether he had knowledge or </P>
<P>not, but I don't think that I ever discussed it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. You never brought that to his attention?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't think so.</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Did he ever tell you or bring it to your </P>
<P>attention that you were acting as public relations counsel for </P>
<P>these people?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I don't recall.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. May I ask two or three questions, and I </P>
<P>have to go.</P>
<P>    I would like to ask you, Mr. Duke, how you became known as </P>
<P>a tax public relations man, or government public relations man, </P>
<P>to contact different agencies of government?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Well, Senator, I have been coming back here for </P>
<P>quite a number of years.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. For what?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. For various--my own businesses, and I manufacture </P>
<P>trailers, and I had to come back here to get cleared through </P>
<P>the various bureaus of the government, and I manufactured </P>
<P>various and sundry items that had to be cleared through </P>
<P>Washington, both in the Internal Revenue Department and in the </P>
<P>old OPA, and the War Production Board, and the army and the </P>
<P>navy; and coming back here at that time, I got acquainted here </P>
<P>with Washington quite well.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Did that help to qualify you in any way </P>
<P>as a tax public relations expert?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Well, I don't know whether it qualified me, but </P>
<P>you take a person that comes out here to Washington and hasn't </P>
<P>been here before, he finds it very difficult, as I did, and I </P>
<P>spent three months here before I found out that I was to go to </P>
<P>the Miscellaneous Tax Division. For three months I was looking </P>
<P>for the Excise Tax Division of the Internal Revenue.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. You got experience in knowing where to </P>
<P>go to in the Internal Revenue Bureau or the Department of </P>
<P>Justice, so that you could guide others and counsel them and </P>
<P>charge a fee for it? I am trying to get your background, and </P>
<P>how you got into this, and how people knew that you had some </P>
<P>services to sell.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. From practical experience and coming back here on </P>
<P>my own work.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. In tax matters?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Oh, yes, I was involved. You see, in everything, </P>
<P>trailers and various and sundry items, there are excise tax and </P>
<P>trailer tax, and there are various numbers of them, and in one </P>
<P>trailer there are eight or nine taxes that you have to pay.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. I understand. And did you have problems </P>
<P>with the revenue bureau here in Washington?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Oh, yes, I did, for several years.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. So you had some practical experience in </P>
<P>contacting them?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Now, did you maintain an office while </P>
<P>you were carrying on these public relations activities?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I did.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Where?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Portland, Oregon.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Do you have an office there now?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, I haven't had an office there since the </P>
<P>explosion, in 1950.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. In 1950?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Did you advertise it as a public </P>
<P>relations service?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I did.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Which you had to offer?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I did.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Did you keep records or files pertaining </P>
<P>to your business?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I have.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Did you keep all of your files?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Every scrap of paper from the time I started </P>
<P>business.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Every scrap of paper?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Have these files been subpoenaed by this </P>
<P>committee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. They have.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Are they now in the possession of the </P>
<P>committee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I wouldn't know.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Do you know whether they have obtained </P>
<P>and have in possession now all of your files, or only a part of </P>
<P>them?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I wouldn't know. You would have to ask the chief </P>
<P>counsel.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. May I ask you, then, have you disclosed </P>
<P>to the committee or to the chief counsel of the committee, Mr. </P>
<P>Flanagan, the whereabouts of your files so that they may be </P>
<P>made available to the committee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. To the best of my knowledge and ability, yes.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. All of your files?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes, sir.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. You know where they all are or where </P>
<P>they were?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I didn't know where they all were, and I had an </P>
<P>idea, and I so disclosed to the committee counsel.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. You have disclosed that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. I have not seen these letters, but there </P>
<P>seems to be one word that is causing some inquiry; in the two </P>
<P>letters that have been referred to here in this preliminary </P>
<P>questioning, the word ``talent'' appears and seems to have some </P>
<P>particular significance as a code word or as related to </P>
<P>something other than ``talent,'' the meaning of which was known </P>
<P>to you and to Mr. Morgan.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. I do not know whether there are other </P>
<P>letters that have the use of this word to convey some </P>
<P>particular meaning or impression. Possibly there are. So I will </P>
<P>ask you, do you know if that is a word that you use frequently </P>
<P>in your correspondence with Mr. Morgan?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I think that if you go through all of my files </P>
<P>and correspondence, I think that you will find that that </P>
<P>expression and word is used to various other people, and not </P>
<P>necessarily lawyers.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. I understand it may have been used in </P>
<P>others, but I want to talk about this correspondence here with </P>
<P>Mr. Morgan, and did you use it frequently in your </P>
<P>correspondence with him?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is possible. I would have to look through my </P>
<P>files to see how often I used it.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. If you used it frequently, did it have </P>
<P>one particular meaning, and one particular significance?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Right at this moment, I couldn't tell you what it </P>
<P>meant.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. At any time, whether the first time you </P>
<P>used it or the last, or in between?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I wouldn't know; right now I wouldn't recall.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Did it have reference--and you know </P>
<P>enough about these two letters to know whether it had reference </P>
<P>to the common and accepted meaning of the word ``talent?''</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, not to its common and accepted meaning.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. It did not?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Then what did it have reference to?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I couldn't tell you, because I don't recall right </P>
<P>at this time.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Would you say that wherever and whenever </P>
<P>you used it, in your correspondence with him, since it did not </P>
<P>refer to talent in the common accepted meaning of the word, </P>
<P>that it did have reference to something specific and in using </P>
<P>it you used it for that specific expression or to convey that </P>
<P>specific meaning each time you used it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is possible.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Well, this is what I am trying to </P>
<P>determine. You would not use the word ``talent'' one time to </P>
<P>mean a race horse, and another time to mean hay or money, or </P>
<P>another time to mean clients, and it had a continuous meaning </P>
<P>as between you and Morgan when you used the word?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is an expression, probably, of mine, and I </P>
<P>think, as I told you, if you go through other correspondence to </P>
<P>various people, it might not be professional people, I might be </P>
<P>referring to talent, and I----</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. How would he know, if you used it to </P>
<P>mean different things, how did Ed Morgan know what you meant </P>
<P>when you used the word, which one you meant?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I might have talked to him on the telephone and I </P>
<P>might have talked to him in person before I left Washington.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. And told him that when you used the word </P>
<P>``talent,'' it meant so-and-so?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not necessarily. I mean discussing various </P>
<P>things.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. I am trying to determine how he </P>
<P>understood what you meant by the word ``talent'' if you did not </P>
<P>know yourself.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. If I could remember right now what I was </P>
<P>referring to, I could tell you right now what it meant.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. The point is, you did not use it in the </P>
<P>sense of the correct meaning of the word, you admit that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. The common accepted meaning.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. That is right. You did not use it to </P>
<P>convey that meaning?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is possible, and I don't recall now what I </P>
<P>used it for.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Well, evidently it had quite a </P>
<P>significance between the two of you; you acknowledge that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It might have had, yes.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. It might have had? Do you not know that </P>
<P>it had?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, I don't.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Do you not now know that it had?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. And you used it to convey that </P>
<P>particular meaning rather than to use the normal term that </P>
<P>would convey the meaning to someone else?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I really do not recall what I meant by that </P>
<P>expression in that letter.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Do you think that you will be able to </P>
<P>recall what you meant by the use of the word ``talent'' in your </P>
<P>correspondence?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is possible.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. You think, given a little time, you will </P>
<P>be able to recall?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It depends, and I will tell you why it depends on </P>
<P>that. As I told you, I was in this explosion, and I might leave </P>
<P>here and land in a hospital and be in a hospital for the next </P>
<P>six months, and I told you I have a malignancy that is </P>
<P>spreading, and I have X-rays in my files to prove it, and this </P>
<P>malignancy spreads and sometimes I will blank out for a couple </P>
<P>of weeks at a time, and so you are asking me if it is possible </P>
<P>to remember----</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. That is the reason you are saying it may </P>
<P>not be possible for you to remember?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I didn't say that. It is possible that it might </P>
<P>be that I might blank out, and I might be blank for maybe a </P>
<P>month or two weeks.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. You might not live to remember, if we </P>
<P>want to indulge in extreme speculations, but I am not trying to </P>
<P>go into your physical condition in detail. You are saying </P>
<P>normally you think you would be able to remember; if that is </P>
<P>right, Okay.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. It is possible. I don't know, Senator. As I told </P>
<P>you, I am trying to keep myself calm; and excitement, I </P>
<P>hemorrhage.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. I do not want you to get excited.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I am under a pressure right now, and that </P>
<P>pressure can blank me out.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Let me ask you another question. What </P>
<P>did you mean by bird-dogging?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Bird-dogging cases, television cases.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Soliciting cases?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Yes, soliciting any kind of cases.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Then what service did you actually have </P>
<P>to sell to prospective clients and to those who employed you? </P>
<P>What service did you actually sell to them?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Can I give you an example?</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. I would like for you to answer the best </P>
<P>way you can.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. A couple of friends of mine had----</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. I understand--first may I qualify that. </P>
<P>It is my understanding that you are not a lawyer.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. You are not an accountant?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. And yet you engage in public relations </P>
<P>dealing with those two professions, primarily?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Well, public relations, anyone can go into that, </P>
<P>and it doesn't----</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. I understand you can go into it, but you </P>
<P>are selling something related to the profession of a lawyer or </P>
<P>public accountant primarily, or to government.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. One of the three, just what you had to </P>
<P>sell to your clients.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I will give you an example. There were a couple </P>
<P>of friends, four friends of mine, that started with about </P>
<P>$1500, and in six years' time they ran this business, a wood </P>
<P>business, to about, I guess, maybe a $2 or $3 million business. </P>
<P>All of the time they retained the same services of a small </P>
<P>bookkeeper, that is all he was. So we met, they came after me </P>
<P>to see what I could do to help and they wanted to retain me as </P>
<P>a public relations expert. I met with them and with their </P>
<P>accountant, and I went over the books and realized he was </P>
<P>absolutely wrong; that under the present bookkeeping system or </P>
<P>the accounting system that he had set up for the firm, it would </P>
<P>cost the firm a fortune, and they were making money but paying </P>
<P>it all out in taxes and holding nothing back in reserve, and </P>
<P>they were ready to go bankrupt, and they retained me at the sum </P>
<P>of $250 a month.</P>
<P>    They could have done this themselves. They had six years </P>
<P>previous to do it in.</P>
<P>    I went down, and retained the services of a certified </P>
<P>public accountant, brought them up to the firm, set up their </P>
<P>books, set them up a new payroll system, and they set up their </P>
<P>machinery and their equipment and their buildings on a lesser </P>
<P>number of years to depreciate, and I saved them thousands of </P>
<P>dollars.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. I am not primarily interested at the </P>
<P>moment in specific cases. I am trying to determine, as a public </P>
<P>relations man and in your relations here with Mr. Morgan, a </P>
<P>Washington attorney, and with others in handling claims against </P>
<P>the government, or in selling some service to clients in </P>
<P>matters relating to the federal government, what you actually </P>
<P>sold them. You did not sell them professional ability as a </P>
<P>lawyer.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. You did not sell them professional </P>
<P>ability as an accountant.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not a professional accountant, no.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. All you sold them was placing them in </P>
<P>contact here with somebody whom you thought could help them?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No, not necessarily.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. What else besides that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I would go over their entire case, over all of </P>
<P>their books, and I would probably spend maybe two or three </P>
<P>weeks going over them to determine, to see if they had a </P>
<P>justifiable cause to oppose the Internal Revenue Department on </P>
<P>their case; and if I so found, I would so advise the client.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Then what further service did you </P>
<P>perform?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Then, I would advise them to retain competent </P>
<P>counsel.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. And you would recommend that counsel </P>
<P>that you thought was competent?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Now, that is the service that you </P>
<P>undertook to perform to earn the fees you charged or which they </P>
<P>would be willing to pay?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is right.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. I just wanted to get that clear.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. Just one question.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. I am sorry. I have to go, and I wanted </P>
<P>to get in the record just what his business was in the thing.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. I have one question along that line.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. I would like to say they have got to put him </P>
<P>on a plane at six o'clock.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. What is the reason for using these code </P>
<P>words, ``talent,'' and so on?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Again, I will have to go back, and I don't </P>
<P>recall.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. What were you trying to cover up?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Well, let us put it this way. My vocabulary is </P>
<P>limited, and I probably used it for a varied expression.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. You have admitted that it is not used in </P>
<P>or it was not used in its usual sense or its usual meaning and </P>
<P>context.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. No.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. What were you trying to cover up?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I didn't admit specifically it was not used in </P>
<P>that as its common acceptance, and I say it is possible that I </P>
<P>used it for not its common acceptance.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. Why, then, would you use it not in its </P>
<P>accepted sense, and what were you trying to cover up?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Nothing to cover up, and I do not recall why I </P>
<P>used it.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. You are not using it in its usual sense?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is true but I still don't recall why I used </P>
<P>it.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. You were trying to cover something up.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. I never tried to cover anything up, and if I had </P>
<P>tried to cover anything up I would have destroyed all of my </P>
<P>files, and there is nothing in my files that I am trying to </P>
<P>cover up, and they are all available.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. You are using code words here.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not necessarily.</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. Who would know what you meant by </P>
<P>``talent'' and the horse race business here, except you who </P>
<P>were sending it and Mr. Morgan on the other end?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Nobody here would, but suppose you and I were </P>
<P>friends, intimately, and we went around together and we used </P>
<P>various expressions, and perhaps I might have been using one, </P>
<P>and you and I would get to know each other very well and have </P>
<P>various expressions, and there it would be a lot better than a </P>
<P>lot of people----</P>
<P>    Senator Jackson. Now, maybe you have given an answer.</P>
<P>    Senator Potter. Could I ask one question? You sold your </P>
<P>services as a public relations man?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. Not necessarily as a public relations man, just </P>
<P>agent.</P>
<P>    Senator Potter. In your testimony, you said that your </P>
<P>office--you had an office?</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. My office was a diversified office.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. Senator Potter, I had hoped we could let </P>
<P>everybody question the witness fully, and I had hoped the </P>
<P>congressmen would have a chance, but the traffic is extremely </P>
<P>bad and it is getting late.</P>
<P>    You are still under subpoena, Mr. Duke, and you are now </P>
<P>ordered to return here on February 2, at ten o'clock in the </P>
<P>morning, unless notified of some other time. And you will call </P>
<P>the committee collect, on the Friday before February 2, you </P>
<P>understand.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. How long is that from now?</P>
<P>    Mr. Flanagan. Two weeks from Friday.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke. That is all right.</P>
<P>    The Chairman. I may say to the congressmen and senators </P>
<P>here, I think it would be well, if we are contacted by the </P>
<P>press, if we would refuse to comment on this matter, in view of </P>
<P>the fact we are in such a preliminary stage.</P>
<P>    [Whereupon, at 5:15 p.m., a recess was taken until 10:00 </P>
<P>a.m., Monday, February 2, 1953.]</P>

<P>    [Editor's note.--Edward P. Morgan (1913-1986) served as an </P>
<P>FBI agent from 1940 to 1947, rising to the rank of chief </P>
<P>inspector. He was also a staff member of the joint committee </P>
<P>that investigated the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1947 </P>
<P>he joined the Washington law firm of Welch, Mott and Morgan, </P>
<P>specializing in corporate, tax, and international law. In 1950 </P>
<P>he became chief counsel to the special subcommittee of the </P>
<P>Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Senator Millard </P>
<P>Tydings, that investigated Senator McCarthy's charges of </P>
<P>Communists in the State Department. During the Korean War, in </P>
<P>1951, Morgan became chief of the enforcement division of the </P>
<P>Office of Price Stabilization. He resigned that position in </P>
<P>1952 and went to Wisconsin to campaign against Senator </P>
<P>McCarthy's reelection.</P>
<P>    After Russell Duke refused to return to testify in public, </P>
<P>Morgan was not called back to give public testimony. In its </P>
<P>annual report, the subcommittee noted: ``There is no indication </P>
<P>that Duke performed any legitimate service for any taxpayer. He </P>
<P>possessed no legal, accounting, or other technical ability. Not </P>
<P>a lawyer himself, he utilized the services of attorneys and </P>
<P>primarily the services of Edward P. Morgan, of Washington, D.C. </P>
<P>In the cases investigated by this subcommittee, Russell W. Duke </P>
<P>received a total of $32,850 in fees, and approximately $2,500 </P>
<P>in expenses; and Attorney Edward P. Morgan received $13,700 in </P>
<P>fees, and $450 in expenses. Completion of this investigation is </P>
<P>awaiting the resolution of Duke's criminal trial. In the </P>
<P>meantime, the evidence concerning Morgan's conduct is being </P>
<P>submitted to the Washington, D.C., Bar Association.'' However, </P>
<P>Duke was acquitted and Morgan remained a member in good </P>
<P>standing in the District Bar. In 1980 and 1985 he served as a </P>
<P>member of the Presidential Commission on Executive, Legislative </P>
<P>and Judicial Salaries, and in 1985 was named to the President's </P>
<P>Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States </P>
<P>Constitution.</P>
<P>    Edward P. Morgan did not testify in public session.]</P>

<P>                        FRIDAY, JANUARY 16, 1953</P>

<P>                               U.S. Senate,</P>
<P>    Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations</P>
<P>                 of the Committee on Government Operations,</P>
<P>                                                    Washington, DC.</P>
<P>    The subcommittee met, pursuant to Senate Resolution 251, </P>
<P>agreed to January 24, 1952, at 10:30 a.m., in room 357 of the </P>
<P>Senate Office Building, Senator Karl E. Mundt presiding.</P>
<P>    Present: Senator Karl E. Mundt, Republican, South Dakota; </P>
<P>Senator Everett M. Dirksen, Republican, Illinois; Charles E. </P>
<P>Potter, Republican, Michigan; Senator John L. McClellan, </P>
<P>Democrat, Arkansas; Senator Henry M. Jackson, Democrat, </P>
<P>Washington.</P>
<P>    Present also: Representative Kenneth A. Keating, </P>
<P>Republican, New York; Representative Patrick J. Hillings, </P>
<P>Republican, California.</P>
<P>    Present also: Roy Cohn, chief counsel; Robert Collier, </P>
<P>chief counsel, House Subcommittee to Investigate the Department </P>
<P>of Justice, Committee on the Judiciary; William A. Leece, </P>
<P>assistant counsel; Jerome S. Adlerman, assistant counsel; </P>
<P>Robert F. Kennedy, assistant counsel; Ruth Young Watt, chief </P>
<P>clerk.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. The committee will come to order.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn, who is our first witness?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Our first witness, Mr. Chairman is Mr. Edward P. </P>
<P>Morgan.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Will you be sworn?</P>
<P>    Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, </P>
<P>and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I do.</P>

<P>                 TESTIMONY OF EDWARD P. MORGAN</P>

<P>    Senator Mundt. For the purpose of the record, will you give </P>
<P>the committee your name and address, present position and </P>
<P>occupation?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Edward P. Morgan, residence 3000 39th Street, </P>
<P>Northwest, Washington, D.C.; business, law office, 710 14th </P>
<P>Street, Northwest.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Now, Mr. Cohn will proceed with the </P>
<P>questioning.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Mr. Morgan, for how long a period of time have </P>
<P>you been engaged in the active practice of law in Washington?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Since March 15, 1947.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What did you do directly prior to that time?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I was associated with the Federal Bureau of </P>
<P>Investigation.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. For how long a period of time?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. March 2, I believe, 1940.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Do you know a man by the name of Russell Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I do.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. When did you first meet Mr. Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. If I may refer to some notes, please, counsel, </P>
<P>because I tried to refresh my memory on first knowledge of this </P>
<P>man, I would like to say at the outset, of course, that since </P>
<P>the inquiries that have come to me from certain members of the </P>
<P>press, I have endeavored to refresh my memory from every source </P>
<P>I possibly could, and on the basis thereof, I am going to try </P>
<P>this morning to certainly present to this committee, completely </P>
<P>and fully, all the information that I have. I must say, </P>
<P>however, that inasmuch as this goes back four and a half, </P>
<P>almost five years, I naturally cannot remember all of the </P>
<P>details; but I certainly will do the best I can.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I think the question was: When did you first meet </P>
<P>Mr. Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. In September; September 16, 1946, to be exact.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And under what circumstances?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. A very good friend of mine, of long standing, </P>
<P>brought Mr. Duke to my office.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What was your friend's name?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Mr. Howard I. Bobbitt, an attorney of Portland, </P>
<P>Oregon, whom I had known for years in the FBI, and who, in </P>
<P>fact, had been agent in charge of the FBI in Portland, Oregon.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And for what purpose did Mr. Bobbitt bring Mr. </P>
<P>Duke to your office on that occasion?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. There was no ostensible purpose in bringing Mr. </P>
<P>Duke to my office. Mr. Bobbitt came into see me, as he does </P>
<P>every time he came to Washington.</P>
<P>    Mr. Duke was accompanying him at that time.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Had you ever heard of Mr. Duke before this </P>
<P>meeting?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Never, to my best knowledge and belief.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Mr. Bobbitt had never mentioned him to you in any </P>
<P>way?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. To my best knowledge and belief, he had not.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And Mr. Bobbitt walked in and brought this man </P>
<P>Duke in with him, and that is the first you ever heard of </P>
<P>Russell Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is correct.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Can you give us the substance of the conversation </P>
<P>at that first meeting?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Well, apart from the matter of mere social </P>
<P>conversation, Mr. Bobbitt mentioned to me that at that time </P>
<P>they had been in Washington along with an attorney from San </P>
<P>Francisco in connection with a particular case, one involving a </P>
<P>man named Thomas Guy Shafer, of Oakland, California.</P>
<P>    He stated that they had been having conferences at the </P>
<P>Bureau of Internal Revenue with respect to the case. He advised </P>
<P>me that Mr. Knox was the counsel for Mr. Shafer and that, in </P>
<P>all probability, the case was going to require a great deal of </P>
<P>additional work and that they would probably need Washington </P>
<P>counsel in connection with it.</P>
<P>    He asked me if I would consider handling the case. I talked </P>
<P>with them in some detail concerning their knowledge of the </P>
<P>matter and asked them if they were in a position to retain me </P>
<P>at that time. They said that certainly, subject to approval by </P>
<P>Mr. Knox.</P>
<P>    Mr. Knox, to the best of my knowledge at that time, was in </P>
<P>Washington, or at least was on his way to New York.</P>
<P>    But, in any event, Mr. Knox came by my office a short time </P>
<P>thereafter and explained to me who Mr. Shafer was. He was a </P>
<P>druggist in Oakland. There was a tax deficiency of a very </P>
<P>sizable amount, approaching, on, as I remember, 400, maybe </P>
<P>$500,000, with the penalties that were involved.</P>
<P>    And thereafter I agreed to represent Mr. Shafer and I did </P>
<P>represent him.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What was Mr. Bobbitt's connection with the tax </P>
<P>man, Mr. Shafer?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Mr. Bobbitt was associated as company counsel </P>
<P>with Mr. Knox.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What was Mr. Duke's connection?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Mr. Duke's connection, there I must say it is </P>
<P>quite vague in my mind, because I had little occasion to </P>
<P>inquire at that particular point.</P>
<P>    As a matter of fact, I am not at all certain, this far </P>
<P>removed, that I have any specific knowledge concerning the </P>
<P>nature of Mr. Duke's association at that time.</P>
<P>    Now, in light of what I now know--and it is sometimes </P>
<P>difficult to distinguish between what you then know and what </P>
<P>you know now--Mr. Duke, it appears, was associated as a public </P>
<P>relations counsel or an investigator or what not for Mr. </P>
<P>Shafer, and it is my understanding, since that time I did not </P>
<P>know it then--to the best of my knowledge, Mr. Knox had engaged </P>
<P>Mr. Duke for that purpose.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And Mr. Duke is not a member of the bar?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Not to my knowledge.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you ever have any communication with Mr. Duke </P>
<P>about the Shafer case after that first meeting?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. When you say communication, do you mean written </P>
<P>communication, or oral?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I mean written or oral, direct.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I am sure he came by my office many times. He </P>
<P>probably inquired about it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What was he doing in connection with this case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Insofar as I was concerned, after I took over </P>
<P>the active handling of the case, there was no service he was </P>
<P>performing as far as I was concerned.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. For what purpose was he in communication with you </P>
<P>when you became counsel?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Merely an inquiry in connection with the case, </P>
<P>as to its status and so on.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Was he representing Mr. Shafer?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. He was representing Mr. Shafer.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I say did he come in and inquire in behalf of Mr. </P>
<P>Shafer?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Not as such. It was merely an inquiry, since he </P>
<P>had been in my office in the initial conversation concerning </P>
<P>the case, as to how the Shafer case was coming along.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And you felt at liberty to discuss that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I didn't see any reason why I shouldn't.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Were you authorized by Mr. Shafer or his counsel </P>
<P>to discuss the case with Mr. Duke or to consult him in any way?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. As a matter of authorization; certainly not. </P>
<P>Mr. Knox knew Mr. Duke and had been in discussion with him, </P>
<P>certainly about the matter. You can ask Mr. Knox.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What finally happened with the Shafer matter?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Mr. Shafer was indicted.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you receive a fee in connection with your </P>
<P>services?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I did not.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You received no remuneration whatsoever?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. None whatsoever.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did Mr. Duke receive any?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I do not know and at that time I had no idea </P>
<P>that Mr. Duke was in any way engaged, as I indicated earlier, </P>
<P>formally in the case.</P>
<P>    I know now that Mr. Duke received funds in connection with </P>
<P>the case, I certainly do.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You know that now?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. When did you find that out?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I found that out from newspaper reports at the </P>
<P>time the King committee was out in California.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. May I inquire: why would you be discussing </P>
<P>the case with Mr. Duke when you knew he was connected with it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Senator, insofar as Mr. Duke was concerned, it </P>
<P>was not a matter of discussing the case, and, as I say, I have </P>
<P>no definite record on the matter. I am sure that somewhere </P>
<P>along the line, after having been in the office with Mr. </P>
<P>Bobbitt, he may have inquired of me, ``How is the Shafer case </P>
<P>coming along,'' something like that.</P>
<P>    I would indicate to him there was nothing to report, </P>
<P>nothing new and no developments in the matter. I saw nothing </P>
<P>improper in that, certainly, still don't.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you ever have any relations with Mr. Duke </P>
<P>concerning any other case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, I did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. How many others.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I would like to indicate specifically each one, </P>
<P>if you would like.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Could you give us first the total and then </P>
<P>discuss them?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Insofar as the reference of matters that I </P>
<P>could say Mr. Duke referred a case to me, there would be two </P>
<P>cases specifically. One was the case of Dr. Ting David Lee, a </P>
<P>Chinese doctor in Portland, Oregon, and the other is a case </P>
<P>involving a man named Noble Wilcoxon, of Sacramento, </P>
<P>California.</P>
<P>    Now, after having made that observation--and if you would </P>
<P>like any other explanation of that I will be glad to give it to </P>
<P>you--I should say this: On November 10, 1948, Mr. Duke came to </P>
<P>my office. He was accompanied at that time by a Mr. Conrad </P>
<P>Hubner, introduced to me as a lawyer of San Francisco. We had a </P>
<P>conversation generally by way of discussion of mutual </P>
<P>acquaintances.</P>
<P>    I learned that Mr. Hubner had associated with him a man </P>
<P>that I had known in the FBI, and at this particular meeting, </P>
<P>Mr. Hubner discussed with me the possibility of handling the </P>
<P>Washington end of two cases in which he was counsel.</P>
<P>    He stated that these cases were at that particular time </P>
<P>still under consideration in San Francisco. He said he was </P>
<P>three thousand miles away from Washington and necessarily had </P>
<P>to have someone here because he couldn't be coming back and </P>
<P>forth to handle the Washington end and the Washington incidents </P>
<P>of the cases, there were two.</P>
<P>    One of those cases involved a man named Harry Blumenthal. </P>
<P>The other involved a man named Wolcher. I have forgotten his </P>
<P>first name.</P>
<P>    Mr. Hubner advised me that he did not know when those cases </P>
<P>would be referred to Washington for consideration.</P>
<P>    I noted here that that visit was on November 10, and that </P>
<P>he forwarded to me power of attorney in each of those cases on </P>
<P>March 24, 1949.</P>
<P>    Now, I mentioned those two cases because there was an </P>
<P>instance where Mr. Duke had referred to me an attorney--I </P>
<P>assume he recommended me. I was very grateful for his having </P>
<P>done so, and I assume responsibility in those cases.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Following this initial recommendation when Mr. </P>
<P>Duke came in with Mr. Hubner, did you have any communication </P>
<P>with Mr. Duke concerning those cases, following the initial </P>
<P>meeting?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The Wolcher and Blumenthal Case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Yes, the Wolcher and Blumenthal.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I may have. I recall none certainly. But I </P>
<P>would not say I did not, because I have no recollection. If you </P>
<P>have anything that might refresh my recollection on the matter, </P>
<P>I would be glad to see it.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Have you examined your files in your office?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, I have. I have examined them, Senator; I </P>
<P>received a subpoena sometime in the afternoon, I guess it was </P>
<P>last Monday, at eight, I believe.</P>
<P>    It was a ``forthwith'' subpoena, requesting that I produce </P>
<P>all records and so on--I don't know, maybe counsel would like </P>
<P>to read the subpoena into the record--with respect to any </P>
<P>correspondence of any kind with Russell Duke and any financial </P>
<P>dealings with Russell Duke and so on.</P>
<P>    As I say, it was the ``forthwith'' subpoena. I wanted to </P>
<P>comply with it in every way possible.</P>
<P>    We had no file on Russell Duke. That meant that to obtain </P>
<P>any correspondence, conceivably we would have to run through </P>
<P>virtually every file in the office, including general </P>
<P>correspondence and that sort of thing.</P>
<P>    But I took girls off other work and made them run a check </P>
<P>of all of our files, and at 5:30 I called the counsel of the </P>
<P>committee, and said that insofar as I was able to I would be </P>
<P>glad to come up and produce these records. They said that </P>
<P>wouldn't be necessary, I could be up in the morning, and I did </P>
<P>at 10:30 in the morning.</P>
<P>    As I said then and I certainly repeat now, I would not </P>
<P>vouch that that is every piece of correspondence with respect </P>
<P>to Russell Duke, I don't know. That is all we could find at the </P>
<P>time. There may be more.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Since the time you produced those papers, have </P>
<P>you continued to search the files to determine whether or not </P>
<P>you did in fact fully comply with the subpoena?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes. We haven't made a consistent project out </P>
<P>of it. We have been very busy in the office in the last few </P>
<P>days. As a matter of fact, when I received the subpoena, I had </P>
<P>a man who traveled eighteen hundred miles to confer with me on </P>
<P>the case. I dropped it and went out on this.</P>
<P>    The best we can, we did, yes. I find no other </P>
<P>correspondence insofar as he is concerned.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You have no other correspondence?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No other correspondence.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. So following the searches you made, you now feel </P>
<P>you have complied with the subpoena?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Insofar as I was able to, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And that you produced every paper called for by </P>
<P>the subpoena, in your possession?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, sir.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What was the final determination of the Wolcher </P>
<P>and Blumenthal cases?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Those were two separate cases.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What was the final determination of each one of </P>
<P>them?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. In the Blumenthal case--I remember that rather </P>
<P>vividly----</P>
<P>    I assume, Senator, that we regard this as proper to be </P>
<P>discussing incidents of a case. I am somewhat reluctant to do </P>
<P>it because of the relationship with the client, but I will go </P>
<P>ahead and do it, if you like.</P>
<P>    In that particular case I conferred with the Justice </P>
<P>Department attorney after the case had been referred to the </P>
<P>Justice Department.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Could you give us his name, please?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I think it was Mr. John Lockley.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Was he in the tax division?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Lockley told me very frankly that they intended to </P>
<P>prosecute Blumenthal unless he saw fit to come clean.</P>
<P>    By that he meant Blumenthal's position was that he had not </P>
<P>received himself, on his own behalf, certain monies in certain </P>
<P>transactions growing out of deals during the war. And Lockley </P>
<P>stated that the Justice Department was simply not going to </P>
<P>accept that position, that they were going to insist that he </P>
<P>indicate who got the money, or they were going to prosecute </P>
<P>him.</P>
<P>    I communicated that information to Mr. Hubner in San </P>
<P>Francisco. Mr. Hubner thereafter advised me Mr. Blumenthal had </P>
<P>stated that he had gone to jail once in connection with the </P>
<P>incidence of that case, and that he did not intend to go again. </P>
<P>Thereupon he made a full disclosure in the matter. That </P>
<P>information was made available to Mr. Lockley.</P>
<P>    I don't know whether Mr. Blumenthal became a witness for </P>
<P>the government thereafter against those individuals who </P>
<P>received the money, or not. To the best of my recollection, the </P>
<P>case was taken on from there.</P>
<P>    I don't know, frankly, the ultimate disposition.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you ever receive a fee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, I received a fee of $1,000.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did Mr. Duke receive a fee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I do not know. I have no knowledge in the </P>
<P>matter.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. At what point in the case did you cease to </P>
<P>be connected with him?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. At such time as I had understood from </P>
<P>conversations with Mr. Hubner that they were going to proceed </P>
<P>locally with a further investigation of the matter, based on </P>
<P>the additional information that Blumenthal had voluntarily </P>
<P>supplied the Department of Justice.</P>
<P>    On the Wolcher case, I had one conference, as I remember </P>
<P>it, perhaps two--I can't be sure of that--with Mr. Lockley. I </P>
<P>remember the first one very vividly, because while I was </P>
<P>talking to Mr. Lockley I received a very fateful telephone call </P>
<P>in my life. The call was for me to consider taking the position </P>
<P>as counsel to a certain committee of the Senate.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Which committee was that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That was a subcommittee of the Senate Foreign </P>
<P>Relations Committee.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did Mr. Duke make any efforts to obtain that </P>
<P>counselship for you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Certainly not. I say certainly not. I don't </P>
<P>know what Mr. Duke may have done at any particular time, but </P>
<P>insofar as I know, he certainly did not.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you ever discuss that counselship with him?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Prior to assuming the counselship?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Certainly not. I am quite positive of that.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Did you afterward?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. What do you mean discuss it, Senator? I don't </P>
<P>understand what you mean. I have discussed the incidents of my </P>
<P>association with that committee but----</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Tell us what you mean by the kind of </P>
<P>discussion that you had.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. With Mr. Duke?</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Correct.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't remember any discussion, with Mr. Duke, </P>
<P>but I certainly wouldn't say, Senator that I didn't talk with </P>
<P>him and with hundreds of other people about my association with </P>
<P>the committee.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. I wondered when you qualified the question </P>
<P>``prior to,'' which indicated that you had discussed it </P>
<P>afterwards.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I made that observation because counsel's </P>
<P>inquiry related to whether Mr. Duke had anything to do with my </P>
<P>securing the position, and I stated that certainly not to my </P>
<P>knowledge, in any way.</P>
<P>    And I remember excusing myself from Mr. Lockley's office at </P>
<P>that time. I talked with those who were interested in having me </P>
<P>take that position, and I agreed to do so.</P>
<P>    Thereafter, having become counsel to the committee, I </P>
<P>withdrew from active consideration of cases and later on Mr. </P>
<P>Hubner came back to Washington for a conference on the Wolcher </P>
<P>case. He went to the Justice Department with one of my law </P>
<P>partners. They conferred on it. Mr. Wolcher thereafter was </P>
<P>indicted, so I understand.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you receive any fee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I received a thousand dollars in connection </P>
<P>with each of those cases, and that $1,000 was a retainer paid </P>
<P>me at the time Mr. Hubner originally engaged me for the purpose </P>
<P>of handling the cases at such time as they might be referred to </P>
<P>Washington for attention.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. The $1,000 was for the purpose of a retainer in </P>
<P>case the cases got down to Washington?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Exactly.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What if the cases didn't go down to Washington?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The retainer necessarily would be returned to </P>
<P>Mr. Hubner.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you ever return any retainer that you took on </P>
<P>that basis in any tax case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. In any tax case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, I have returned retainers.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. In tax cases. You took the retainer predicated on </P>
<P>the possibility of the case going to Washington?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Well, now, I think of one case in which a fee </P>
<P>in escrow was returned.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What was the name of that case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That was the Shafer case.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. That is the one in connection with which you </P>
<P>originally met Mr. Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That was the one at the time Mr. Bobbitt </P>
<P>brought Mr. Duke to my office.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I asked whether or not you had received any fee </P>
<P>and you said no.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I didn't receive any fee.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. How much was put up in escrow?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. $20,000.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What was the escrow arrangement?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The escrow arrangement was simply this: I </P>
<P>talked to Mr. Knox at the outset in the handling of the case. </P>
<P>The matter of fee came up. Mr. Knox explained it to me this </P>
<P>way: that Mr. Shafer had spent a great deal of money in </P>
<P>connection with legal representation and for other purposes in </P>
<P>an effort to get this case disposed of locally; and that he did </P>
<P>not feel in the position to want to spend any additional money </P>
<P>by way of a fee as such.</P>
<P>    That, of course, meant that he wanted the case to be </P>
<P>handled on a contingency basis.</P>
<P>    I discussed with Mr. Knox fully the incidents of the </P>
<P>matter. I looked at the size of the case insofar as dollars and </P>
<P>cents were concerned, I looked at the ramifications of it, I </P>
<P>looked at the financial position of the client. I set a </P>
<P>contingency fee, explaining to Mr. Knox at that point that </P>
<P>manifestly, in a case that was going to involve as much work as </P>
<P>certainly I anticipated would be involved in this case, that </P>
<P>the contingency would be appreciably higher than would be an </P>
<P>out-and-out fee at the outset.</P>
<P>    In setting the fee additionally, I realized that I would </P>
<P>have to send a reference fee to Mr. Bobbitt.</P>
<P>    I also contemplated that I would probably have to go to </P>
<P>California to make inquiry and further investigation and </P>
<P>probably engage an accountant, which I assumed that I would </P>
<P>have to pay for in the situation.</P>
<P>    This fee was placed in escrow in the event prosecution was </P>
<P>denied in the case.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Who was the escrow agent?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The escrow agent--there was no formal escrow </P>
<P>agent.</P>
<P>    It was maintained in a reserve account in Riggs National </P>
<P>Bank.</P>
<P>    I understood Mr. Knox and I had formal correspondence with </P>
<P>respect to the arrangement.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Exactly what was the contingency involved?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Mr. Shafer did not want to be prosecuted. The </P>
<P>contingency in the case was whether or not we could present the </P>
<P>case to the Department of Justice that would adequately </P>
<P>convince the department that this was a case that should not be </P>
<P>prosecuted criminally.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. The indictment was stopped or did not go forward?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Well, you can characterize it any way you like.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you return the $20,000 immediately after the </P>
<P>filing of the indictment?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. We did. I did not return it because I was not </P>
<P>with the firm at that time, but my office did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I think you were telling us about two other tax </P>
<P>cases which you handled as a result of introductions by Mr. </P>
<P>Duke, is that correct?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. There are two other cases in which Mr. Duke </P>
<P>seems to have been in the picture; and I want to relate both of </P>
<P>them.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Will you please do so?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    One case is a case involving a man named Jack Glass, of Los </P>
<P>Angeles, California. That case came to me by reference to me </P>
<P>from an attorney named Maurice Hendon.</P>
<P>    I might say Mr. Hendon was then and is still a very </P>
<P>prominent lawyer.</P>
<P>    Mr. Hendon called me concerning the handling of the case. </P>
<P>He made arrangements whereby he would come back to Washington </P>
<P>for a conference. There Mr. Hendon paid me a fee in connection </P>
<P>with the case, and I gave him a one-third reference fee for </P>
<P>referring the case to me.</P>
<P>    At some stage of the picture--I don't know just exactly </P>
<P>where, when and how, I ascertained that Mr. Duke had approached </P>
<P>Mr. Glass in connection with this case.</P>
<P>    I am frank to say that I think my knowledge insofar as any </P>
<P>particularity is concerned, it stems from a conference I had </P>
<P>with Mr. deWind of the King committee, who indicated to me, I </P>
<P>think that in this particular matter Duke had obtained some </P>
<P>money.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Exactly when was this?</P>
<P>    When did you get into the Glass case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Mr. Hendon, called my office on July 12, 1949, </P>
<P>and I held a conference with Hendon here in Washington, as I </P>
<P>remember, on July 27, 1949.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. It is your testimony that in the course of the </P>
<P>telephone conversation, in the course of the first meeting, Mr. </P>
<P>Duke's name was not mentioned in any way?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. To the best of my knowledge and belief, it was </P>
<P>not.</P>
<P>    Now, in trying to recall something that happened that long </P>
<P>ago--I was in Los Angeles the other day in connection with </P>
<P>other business matters. I had a conference with Mr. Hendon in </P>
<P>connection with something wholly unrelated to any of this sort </P>
<P>of thing. He brought up at that time the fact that when the </P>
<P>King committee had been on the West Coast, that he had </P>
<P>submitted to the committee an affidavit concerning the matter.</P>
<P>    I asked him at that point: I said, ``How and when and under </P>
<P>what circumstances, as best you can remember, did Mr. Duke </P>
<P>enter into this picture?''</P>
<P>    He stated to me that his reference of this case to me was </P>
<P>by reason of some friend of mine who was a lawyer that he knew. </P>
<P>I don't know whether it was someone that I had known in the </P>
<P>bureau, or not.</P>
<P>    He said that Duke had approached Glass and made an </P>
<P>arrangement with Glass over his objection.</P>
<P>    That is the best that I can do to help you on that. That is </P>
<P>Mr. Hendon's recollection of the matter; insofar as I can </P>
<P>recall, it is my recollection.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. When did you first discover Mr. Duke's connection </P>
<P>with this particular case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I just couldn't recall. It is just a blank. I </P>
<P>remember Mr. deWind speaking out. I remember talking to Mr. </P>
<P>Hendon about it. But I don't remember any conversations with </P>
<P>Mr. Duke about it, but that certainly wouldn't mean that there </P>
<P>weren't any.</P>
<P>    Here is what I am trying to remember in this situation. </P>
<P>Frankly, I draw a blank on it.</P>
<P>    When Mr. Hendon was back here in July 1949, July 27, 1949, </P>
<P>I am, sure that if Duke were in the picture, that he must have </P>
<P>mentioned it, we must have discussed it. But I just have no </P>
<P>recollection on the point.</P>
<P>    Mr Cohn. Did you keep any diary entries?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No, I maintain no diary.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. From what were you able to reconstruct some of </P>
<P>these exact dates you have given us here?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. From the files on each of the cases.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You mean correspondence?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes. I mean correspondence or memoranda in the </P>
<P>files.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Would your memoranda in the files in the Glass </P>
<P>case reflect whether or not Mr. Duke had been present at any of </P>
<P>these meetings?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. You mean insofar as with Mr. Hendon?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. With Mr. Hendon or with anybody else in </P>
<P>connection with the case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I am certain, insofar as I can reconstruct the </P>
<P>situation, counsel, that Mr. Duke was never at any conference </P>
<P>with me and Mr. Hendon.</P>
<P>    In other words, I just have no recollection of it, and I am </P>
<P>sure if it occurred I would have remembered it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What was the final disposition of the Glass case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Mr. Glass was declared non compos mentis by the </P>
<P>court in Los Angeles.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Was that following an indictment?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No; it was prior to indictment. Mr. Glass was </P>
<P>supposed to have a very serious heart condition, and Mr. Glass </P>
<P>did have a heart condition, and I was advised by Mr. Hendon </P>
<P>that his physician said that the strain in connection with the </P>
<P>whole matter was responsible for it.</P>
<P>    I say that because that was one of the things we presented </P>
<P>to the department as a basis for arguing that the case should </P>
<P>not be prosecuted.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. With whom in the Department of Justice did you </P>
<P>deal in connection with the case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. As I remember, it was Colonel Victor </P>
<P>Swearingen.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you receive any fee in connection with the </P>
<P>services you rendered in the Glass case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. How much?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I received a fee of $4,000, of which $1,500 I </P>
<P>forwarded to Mr. Hendon as a reference fee.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did Mr. Duke receive any compensation in </P>
<P>connection with that case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I have indicated to you, according to Mr. </P>
<P>deWind that he did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. How much was it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't know.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Mr. deWind mentioned no amount?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. He may have. I just don't remember.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What is the next case you handled with which Mr. </P>
<P>Duke had a connection?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. This particular case, when you say Mr. Duke had </P>
<P>a connection, I remember quite well. I have tried to remember, </P>
<P>as best I can, the initial meeting in my office with Mr. </P>
<P>Bobbitt. At that time Mr. Duke was discussing various cases in </P>
<P>which he had been concerned. In other words, he was giving his </P>
<P>background to me, more or less. He had explained that during </P>
<P>the war he had represented various companies and organizations </P>
<P>and that many of those were involved in difficulties. I have </P>
<P>tried to remember some of those that he mentioned because a </P>
<P>newspaper man the other day asked me if I remember one case, </P>
<P>and there came back a flicker of memory on it.</P>
<P>    It relates, I think to that discussion. It is a case </P>
<P>involving di Martini, that is. But who they were I don't know.</P>
<P>    Now, di Martini, I didn't handle the case, don't remember </P>
<P>it. But there was one matter I do remember his mentioning when </P>
<P>he was in my office, and that is a rather bizarre case, on the </P>
<P>basis of what I now know about the incidence of it, involving </P>
<P>an Inez Burns of San Francisco.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Just a minute, before we get away from this.</P>
<P>    All this discussion, this string of cases, was taking place </P>
<P>in your office, the first time you met him; is that right?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No, Senator. These cases, I will be glad to </P>
<P>give you date by date as to when any of these cases came my </P>
<P>way. But I want to remember this case.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. It is my understanding of your testimony a </P>
<P>few minutes ago that you said Mr. Bobbitt came to your office </P>
<P>and Mr. Duke was telling you about all these various cases.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I was trying to resurrect my knowledge of Mr. </P>
<P>Duke and his activities, and this is the case I am about to </P>
<P>mention.</P>
<P>    That is when I first heard of it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. It is my understanding from your testimony just a </P>
<P>couple of minutes ago, that you were referring to this first </P>
<P>meeting in which Mr. Bobbitt brought Mr. Duke to your office.</P>
<P>    You testified previously that the Shafer case was </P>
<P>discussed, is that right?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is the case that Mr. Bobbitt referred to </P>
<P>me, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And Duke came along to that meeting at which </P>
<P>there was a reference to the case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. It was the first time I ever met the gentlemen.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Haven't you just testified that at the same </P>
<P>meeting Mr. Duke also mentioned to you this Inez Burns case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I am trying to give you the background in </P>
<P>connection with the Burns matter because this is not a case in </P>
<P>which I feel that I was in any way associated with Mr. Duke as </P>
<P>a lawyer or anything like that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What I am trying to get at is this: Did Mr. Duke </P>
<P>mention this Inez Burns case to you at the first meeting </P>
<P>between Mr. Bobbitt, Mr. Duke and yourself?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I am disposed to think he probably did, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did he mention a case involving someone named di </P>
<P>Martini?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, I think so.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Were there any other cases mentioned by Mr. Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't remember any others.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Why did Mr. Duke, who is a public relations man, </P>
<P>not a lawyer, bring up three tax cases in his discussion with </P>
<P>you on that first occasion?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. As I remember, there were two: the Burns matter </P>
<P>and the di Martini case.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. How about Shafer?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Mr. Bobbitt brought that case to me.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You mean Mr. Duke didn't mention it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Mr. Duke was certainly there. But I mean in </P>
<P>source as far as I was concerned, that is a reference from--I </P>
<P>wouldn't say a lifelong friend but a friend of many years' </P>
<P>standing, who is a very reputable lawyer on the West Coast.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. He brought Mr. Duke with him, and Mr. Duke </P>
<P>participated in the discussion?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. There is no question about that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did Mr. Duke participate in the discussion, about </P>
<P>the Shafer case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Mr. Bobbitt led the discussion in all.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did Mr. Duke participate?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. He may have.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Don't you remember where he did, or whether he </P>
<P>did or didn't?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Frankly, I don't.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You do remember discussing that case with Mr. </P>
<P>Duke on subsequent occasions?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Discussing as I said before. I have no positive </P>
<P>recollection on it, but if he inquired about the status of the </P>
<P>case we talked about it in my office with Mr. Bobbitt, I would </P>
<P>certainly have indicated to him what the status was.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You said you had no positive recollection of it. </P>
<P>I thought you had previously testified quite definitely that </P>
<P>you had a clear recollection of Mr. Duke having made inquiries </P>
<P>as to the status of the case and having called you about the </P>
<P>Shafer case after the first meeting.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The record will reflect that, Mr. Counsel.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What is your testimony now?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. My testimony is now that I have no definite </P>
<P>recollection of discussions with Mr. Duke concerning the Shafer </P>
<P>case after the initial meeting, other than the fact that if he </P>
<P>had inquired about it I would have certainly told him the </P>
<P>status of the case.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Except for that conjecture, it is your testimony </P>
<P>now that, according to your present recollection, you have no </P>
<P>recollection whatsoever of having discussed the case with Mr. </P>
<P>Duke after that first meeting?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. My testimony is that I have no positive </P>
<P>recollection one way or the other.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Were any other tax cases discussed at that first </P>
<P>meeting.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I tried to give you the last one, and if you </P>
<P>will let me proceed with it now, I will.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Will you give me the name of the last one, </P>
<P>please?</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. That still doesn't answer the question.</P>
<P>    The question was: were any other cases discussed at the </P>
<P>first meeting?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Nothing other than the ones we have mentioned.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Burns, di Martini and Shafer?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. You are sure of that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Now, we were talking about the Burns case.</P>
<P>    Could you tell us what was said about the Burns case by Mr. </P>
<P>Duke to you at that first meeting?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. My only recollection of that matter this far </P>
<P>removed is the presentation to me of a rather gory story about </P>
<P>the woman who had a large sum of money that she had secreted in </P>
<P>the basement of her home and that the rats had eaten up the </P>
<P>money and that it had become gummy and so forth. On the basis </P>
<P>of that, I recall that particular phase of it.</P>
<P>    I remember that Duke indicated at that time that he had </P>
<P>some connection with this particular individual. And, as I </P>
<P>remember, he also had some connection with the attorney, as he </P>
<P>so indicated.</P>
<P>    He said that he did not know what would ultimately happen </P>
<P>with the case or what the disposition of the case might be </P>
<P>ultimately, but that that was one of those situations in which </P>
<P>he hoped that he might refer to me as attorney.</P>
<P>    On that occasion, that was in September 1948.</P>
<P>    I did, in December of 1950--that is two years later--by </P>
<P>reference with Mr. Frank Ford, attorney of San Francisco, </P>
<P>associate myself with him in this particular case.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Now, in between the original discussion with Mr. </P>
<P>Bobbitt, Mr. Duke and yourself about the Burns case at the time </P>
<P>you were retained in 1950, did you have any further discussions </P>
<P>with Mr. Duke about the Burns case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I may have.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Oral or written?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I may very well have.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you or didn't you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't remember.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You have no recollection whatsoever?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Did you have any correspondence with him?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I recall no correspondence in the file.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you do anything in connection with the Burns </P>
<P>case between this initial conversation in September 1948, and </P>
<P>the time you were retained in 1950?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I may very well have. Probably to what you are </P>
<P>referring.</P>
<P>    I received a copy of a so-called expose in the Duke matter </P>
<P>with respect to a newspaper in San Francisco.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. My question, Mr. Morgan, was----</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I am going to answer your question.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I would appreciate it if you would.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That particular newspaper account relates to a </P>
<P>postscript attributed to a letter from me to Duke. In that </P>
<P>particular postscript, as I remember--and I don't remember the </P>
<P>specific wording of it--but there is some indication that a </P>
<P>check on the Burns case does not locate it back to Washington, </P>
<P>and a request for an indication as to who the counsel was in </P>
<P>the case; in other words, requesting information from Duke.</P>
<P>    So, if such a piece of correspondence exists, then to that </P>
<P>extent certainly I did.</P>
<P>    I don't have the slightest recollection of it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Mr. Chairman, in response to the subpoena served </P>
<P>on this witness, he produced a copy of a letter dated March 31, </P>
<P>1949, as addressed to Mr. Russell Duke, signed by the penned </P>
<P>signature and added typed signature, Edward P. Morgan, on the </P>
<P>stationery of Welch, Mott and Morgan.</P>
<P>    I would ask that that letter be received in evidence.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Is that the letter with the postscript?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Yes, that is the letter with the postscript, to </P>
<P>which this witness affixed his signature.</P>
<P>    [The letter referred to was marked as committee's Exhibit </P>
<P>No. 3, January 16, 1953, Edward P. Morgan.]</P>

<P>                                                    March 31, 1949.</P>
<P>Mr. Russell Duke,</P>
<P> 4523 Northeast Alameda,</P>
<P>Portland 13, Oregon.</P>
<P>    Dear Russ: Pursuant to our conversation yesterday, I am enclosing </P>
<P>herewith two photostatic copies of an editorial which may be somewhat </P>
<P>helpful to you relative to the matter which we discussed, along with a </P>
<P>clipping from the local Washington Times Herald.</P>
<P>    Best personal regards.</P>
<P>            Sincerely,</P>
<P>                                                  Edward P. Morgan.</P>
<P>    Enclosures.</P>
<P>    P.S. I don't seem to be able to get a line on Inez B. at either </P>
<P>place back here. Who is the attorney of record in her case? Can you </P>
<P>check at S.F. to find when they referred it to D.C.?</P>
<P>                                                               EPM.</P>

<P>    Mr. Morgan. Should I have produced the letter pursuant to </P>
<P>the subpoena?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That would be it, then.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. May I read it ?</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Do you want to see the letter?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Well, I would like to see it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. After examining it, Mr. Morgan, would you read </P>
<P>the postscript, please?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. This is a letter dated March 31, 1949.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Let me ask you first: is that your </P>
<P>signature?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't think there is any question about it, </P>
<P>Senator.</P>
<P>    The letter is dated March 31, 1949, on the letterhead of my </P>
<P>office. It is addressed to Mr. Russell Duke, 45233 Northeast </P>
<P>Alameda, Portland 31, Oregon.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Would you read the postscript, please.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. ``Dear Russ''--may I read the entire letter?</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Surely.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan.</P>

<P>    Pursuant to our conversation yesterday I am enclosing </P>
<P>herewith two photostatic copies of an editorial which may be </P>
<P>somewhat helpful to you relative to the matter which we </P>
<P>discussed, along with a clipping from the local Washington </P>
<P>Times Herald.</P>
<P>    Best personal regards. Sincerely, Edward P. Morgan.</P>

<P>    It is signed ``Ed.'' Now, there is a postscript:</P>

<P>    I don't seem to be able to get a line on Inez B.----</P>

<P>    Which would be Inez Burns, presumably.</P>

<P>at either place back here. Who is the attorney of record in her </P>
<P>case? Can you check at S. F. to find when they referred to D.C.</P>

<P>    It is initialed EPM.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What did you mean by either place you were unable </P>
<P>to get a line?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That would be whether or not it would be in the </P>
<P>Bureau of Internal Revenue or the Department of Justice.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Had you made inquiries at the Bureau of Internal </P>
<P>Revenue and Department of Justice with reference to this case </P>
<P>prior to being retained?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. If this inquiry here was made, most assuredly </P>
<P>it was made before I was formally retained in December of 1950.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Do you have any doubts that such an inquiry was </P>
<P>made?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I would say that it must have been made. And </P>
<P>having been made and looking at this now, to the best of my </P>
<P>recollection, I think I could give you the situation, if you </P>
<P>would like to have it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. First may I ask you this, Mr. Morgan: Whom did </P>
<P>you contact in the Justice Department and with whom were you in </P>
<P>contact in the Bureau of Internal Revenue?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The contacts with the Justice Department is </P>
<P>with the clerk handling the cases over there. No power of </P>
<P>attorney is required or as required in the Department of </P>
<P>Justice.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I was just trying to get the name.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Somebody who handles the records. It would be </P>
<P>some girl.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. How about the Bureau of Internal Revenue?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The Bureau of Internal Revenue--and the reason </P>
<P>I think I might remember this is the fact that I believe it is </P>
<P>the first time that I realized, as a practical matter, that you </P>
<P>had to have a power of attorney in order to ascertain whether a </P>
<P>case was pending in the Bureau of Internal Revenue.</P>
<P>    I had known, of course, that you had to have a power of </P>
<P>attorney in order to represent a client before the Bureau of </P>
<P>Internal Revenue.</P>
<P>    But in this particular instance, I am sure, by reason of an </P>
<P>inquiry as to the attorney of record, that we were advised that </P>
<P>they could supply no information concerning the matter.</P>
<P>    Now, I have no background recollection on that other than </P>
<P>just what I have said.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Do you recall the purpose of the editorial?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Senator, I don't have the slightest idea. The </P>
<P>note here ``Please return the news clipping,'' it is the only </P>
<P>one I had. I don't know what it related to. I have no idea. </P>
<P>That was March 1949.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. It is a matter of some importance, because </P>
<P>the letter indicated the day before you had called Mr. Duke by </P>
<P>long distance and talked with him about it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Whether I called Mr. Duke or Mr. Duke called </P>
<P>me, I don't know.</P>
<P>    I would say this: Mr. Duke was very prolific in his </P>
<P>telephone calls. I think if you were to check his records, you </P>
<P>would find that he made calls all over the country, and he </P>
<P>called many, many times, Senator, there is no question about </P>
<P>that, about many different things.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. You mean he called you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes. When I wasn't there he called one of my </P>
<P>partners. He called me at home at night, all hours of the </P>
<P>night.</P>
<P>    So there is no question about that, sure, he called me many </P>
<P>times. I would imagine he called me. But I couldn't be sure of </P>
<P>that, I don't know.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What was the next step in the Burns case? Did you </P>
<P>hear back from Mr. Duke as to the name of the attorney of </P>
<P>record and when it was referred from San Francisco to the </P>
<P>District of Columbia?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. To the best of my knowledge, I didn't.</P>
<P>    To the best of my knowledge, that is the last I can recall </P>
<P>of it, and I don't think the file enlightens me any.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Until the time you were retained in 1950?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. By Mr. Ford.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You have no recollection having done anything in </P>
<P>connection with the Burns case between March 31, 1949, the date </P>
<P>of this letter, and the date on which you were formally </P>
<P>retained by Mr. Ford?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I have no recollection of having done anything, </P>
<P>and my opinion is that I did nothing.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you discuss it with Mr. Duke between those </P>
<P>dates?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I have no recollection of it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you discuss it with Mr. Duke between the </P>
<P>period of time that you were formally retained?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. To the best of my knowledge, I did not, but I </P>
<P>cannot be sure of that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What was the ultimate disposition of the Burns </P>
<P>case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. She was indicted.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you receive any fee in connection with the </P>
<P>Burns case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, I did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. How much?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I think I received a fee in the neighborhood--</P>
<P>and this was paid me by Mr. Ford, the attorney--in the </P>
<P>neighborhood of something over $2,000, as I remember.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did Mr. Duke receive any compensation in </P>
<P>connection with that case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Not to my knowledge.</P>
<P>    On that I feel reasonably certain, although on that I can't </P>
<P>be sure, because at the time I talked with Mr. DeWind he </P>
<P>discussed many situations in which Mr. Duke might have been </P>
<P>involved, some of which I had never heard of. He may have </P>
<P>advised me, but I just have no recollection.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. How did he make out? With all these long </P>
<P>discussions by long distance calls--never seemed to get a fee.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Senator, you will have to talk to Mr. Duke </P>
<P>about that, I can't help it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Are there any other tax cases concerning which </P>
<P>you had any dealings with Mr. Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. To the best of my knowledge and belief, there </P>
<P>are no others.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you mention a case involving a Dr. Lee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Tell us about that.</P>
<P>    What connection did Mr. Duke have with that case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The records of that office indicated that in </P>
<P>March of 1949, Mr. Duke called the office to indicate that a </P>
<P>Chinese Doctor named Ting David Lee had had a jeopardy </P>
<P>assessment levied in his case and that the situation involved </P>
<P>moneys received by Dr. Lee by way of inheritance from the Lee </P>
<P>family in China.</P>
<P>    He asked me if I would undertake to try to help him. He </P>
<P>said he had been trying to help Dr. Lee out there as best he </P>
<P>could in connection with the matter, and the man was strapped, </P>
<P>he had buildings downtown, it was perfect security for the </P>
<P>obligation owed the government, and that he felt that the </P>
<P>jeopardy assessment was unjust.</P>
<P>    I told him that I would be glad to help him and in a way </P>
<P>that I properly could.</P>
<P>    Then thereafter I wrote him, as I remember, indicating </P>
<P>that----</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. By ``him,'' do you mean Lee or Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. To Duke, after he had called me--indicating </P>
<P>that I felt they should supply more information to me in order </P>
<P>that I could make an appraisal of the situation and to see in </P>
<P>what manner and to what extent we might be of assistance.</P>
<P>    The next thing I knew, Mr. Duke appeared in Washington with </P>
<P>Dr. Lee, came to my office. I met Dr. Lee.</P>
<P>    He impressed me as a very sincere type individual, and Mr. </P>
<P>Duke was obviously his agent, there is no question about that.</P>
<P>    As a matter of fact, in view of Dr. Lee's complete lack of </P>
<P>acquaintance with any phase of tax matters, he certainly needed </P>
<P>some help.</P>
<P>    And they told me what the story was. He had the jeopardy </P>
<P>assessment, he even had to borrow money to get back to </P>
<P>Washington he said, in connection with the case. He wanted to </P>
<P>know if I could do anything in connection with it.</P>
<P>    I said ``Well, I don't know what we could do.''</P>
<P>    We went over to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and I would </P>
<P>like to say at this point that, to my knowledge, I didn't know </P>
<P>one single person over there, that is, to the best of my </P>
<P>recollection.</P>
<P>    We went first to the----</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. What do you mean by ``we'' now, the three of </P>
<P>you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The three.</P>
<P>    I had no doubts about Mr. Duke, I thought he was perfectly </P>
<P>legitimate. I took him right along.</P>
<P>    We first went to the technical staff. We talked there--</P>
<P>well, I don't remember with whom we talked, but it must have </P>
<P>been some official there--about the case.</P>
<P>    He explained to me that they felt that they could not grant </P>
<P>a conference prior to the filing of a petition in the tax </P>
<P>court; that was the normal procedure and they felt that they </P>
<P>didn't want to depart from it in this case.</P>
<P>    We next went down on the collector's office to find out if </P>
<P>there was any possibility of lifting the jeopardy assessment </P>
<P>upon a showing of tangible assets in this country that would </P>
<P>adequately protect the government. Dr. Lee explained everything </P>
<P>he had.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. To whom did you talk there?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't remember his name, Senator. It was some </P>
<P>subordinate we talked to, anyway. I had made no appointment </P>
<P>with anybody. We just walked in cold. As a result of that, </P>
<P>nothing was accomplished. They felt we could do nothing. They </P>
<P>felt the matter of protecting the revenues was the </P>
<P>responsibility of the local collector.</P>
<P>    So we went back to the office and Mr. Lee asked me what had </P>
<P>to be done in the situation. I explained to him there was one </P>
<P>thing that could be done. That was to file a petition in the </P>
<P>tax court and then request an early hearing before the </P>
<P>technical staff, in the hopes that you could have the matter </P>
<P>resolved and get the jeopardy assessment lifted.</P>
<P>    He asked me if I would undertake to represent him in </P>
<P>connection with the matter, and I agreed to do so.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you thereafter represent him?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What was the final determination in that case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The final determination of the case was a set </P>
<P>limit through the technical staff.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. In other words, you went ahead and filed the </P>
<P>petition, is that right?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is right, a petition was filed in </P>
<P>Washington, with the tax court.</P>
<P>    I requested the head of the technical staff on the West </P>
<P>Coast for a conference. He set a conference date.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Could you give us his name?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I think it is Mr. Harlacker, as I remember. He </P>
<P>set a date for it. I flew to Portland, a period before the </P>
<P>technical staff, presented such evidence as Dr. Lee was in a </P>
<P>position to present, demonstrating that he had received these </P>
<P>moneys from China as a part of the Lee estate, that it was not </P>
<P>income subject to income tax. Thereafter I outlined for him </P>
<P>additional information which should be presented to support his </P>
<P>case based on inquiries made at the conference.</P>
<P>    I returned to Washington thereafter. From time to time I </P>
<P>understand Dr. Lee was able to find record evidence of the </P>
<P>receipt of moneys from China, which he presented to the </P>
<P>technical staff. On the basis thereafter, the case was </P>
<P>ultimately compromised.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did the compromise take place out west?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The first knowledge that I had of the </P>
<P>compromise was, as I had the power of attorney, and of course </P>
<P>it was my responsibility to agree to the compromise, and the </P>
<P>proposed compromise was referred to me for acceptance. I sent </P>
<P>it to Dr. Lee. I outlined the considerations in his case. I </P>
<P>recommended that he accept it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. How much was the original jeopardy assessment?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The jeopardy assessment, as I remember it </P>
<P>involved something like $100,000.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. For how much was it settled.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. It was settled for something over $6,000, with </P>
<P>interest. I think there was an interest item that may be </P>
<P>brought it up over seven. I can't give you exact figures, </P>
<P>without checking on it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you do anything in Washington in the Internal </P>
<P>Revenue Bureau to obtain an approval of the settlement down </P>
<P>there?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. To the best of my knowledge and belief on this </P>
<P>case, I did not.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. In other words, your own contact with the Bureau </P>
<P>of Internal Revenue was your original visit when you were </P>
<P>accompanied by Duke and the tax man.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. And the appearance of the technical staff.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. That was out west, wasn't it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I was talking about Washington.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. In Washington, to the best of my knowledge and </P>
<P>belief, that is all.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And you had no communication, direct or indirect, </P>
<P>with anyone in the Bureau of Internal Revenue in Washington in </P>
<P>this case, following the original meeting; is that right?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Right.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. How many times were you out west conferring with </P>
<P>the technical staff in connection with the matter?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. One time.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you receive a fee in this case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, I did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. How much.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. It was a contingent fee. Dr. Lee explained to </P>
<P>me that he didn't have any money, that all his funds were tied </P>
<P>up.</P>
<P>    He asked me if I would undertake to represent him on a </P>
<P>contingency basis, the contingency being whether or not he ever </P>
<P>got any money so he could pay me.</P>
<P>    I agreed to do so. He set a contingency fee of $4,000 in </P>
<P>the case. I flew out to Portland, flew back. I had certain </P>
<P>expenses while I was there.</P>
<P>    As I remember, I was there about three days. I made about </P>
<P>three speeches in the state while I was there. I don't remember </P>
<P>whether they were scheduled before, or after I knew I was </P>
<P>going.</P>
<P>    When I got back, I communicated with Dr. Lee, explaining to </P>
<P>him--I think maybe I communicated with Russell Duke--explaining </P>
<P>to him that I did not feel that our contingency arrangement </P>
<P>would relate to the actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred on </P>
<P>the trip.</P>
<P>    Thereafter--I have forgotten the exact date--he sent me a </P>
<P>check covering the out-of-pocket expenses which would total </P>
<P>something around $400, as I remember.</P>
<P>    Thereafter the case was settled, the jeopardy assessment </P>
<P>was lifted. Dr. Lee paid our office the balance, and he </P>
<P>deducted, as I remember the expenses from the original fee and </P>
<P>got something around $3,450, something like that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Can you tell us the total amount of money you </P>
<P>received by you from Dr. Lee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes. I received $3,450 and expenses of $450.</P>
<P>    I might say, Mr. Counsel, knowing what I know now about the </P>
<P>practice of law, I never would take a case of this kind for a </P>
<P>fee that low if it were on a contingent basis.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did Mr. Duke receive any compensation?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I now know that Mr. Duke received very </P>
<P>substantial compensation in connection with the matter. I </P>
<P>understand that Mr. Duke received in the neighborhood of maybe </P>
<P>as much as eight or nine thousand dollars.</P>
<P>    If I might just add, gentlemen, I can assure you that I </P>
<P>would not be handling the case for $4,000 contingent fee if I </P>
<P>had known Mr. Duke was getting $8,000 or $9,000.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And the amount the taxpayer paid out to you and </P>
<P>Mr. Duke was about twice as much the amount the government got, </P>
<P>as a result of the settlement, is that right?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I think those facts are self evident.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Is there any other tax case----</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Let me ask you first: Did you get your </P>
<P>payment from Mr. Duke, or Mr. Lee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. From Dr. Lee.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Yes, Dr. Lee. The check was made payable to </P>
<P>the law office, Senator.</P>
<P>    I was out of town, Senator, as I remember, at the time. In </P>
<P>other words, I was not available, and Dr. Lee communicated with </P>
<P>the office saying that Mr. Duke wanted the money paid to him, </P>
<P>and one of my partners wired out there that money was due to </P>
<P>Welch, Mott and Morgan and the check should be made payable to </P>
<P>Welch, Mott, and Morgan. So it was payable to the firm.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. The money the firm received came from Dr. </P>
<P>Lee in a check signed by him?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Right.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. You received no money from Mr. Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. As a matter of fact, I didn't see the check, </P>
<P>but I am sure it must have been from Dr. Lee, because the </P>
<P>correspondence indicates that he had forwarded the check.</P>
<P>    I am sure it was not Mr. Duke. Of that I am confident.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. You are sure you received no money from Mr. </P>
<P>Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No, sir.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Is there any other tax case in which you had </P>
<P>dealings with Mr. Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. To the best of my knowledge and belief, no.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Getting back to this Lee case for one minute, in </P>
<P>what capacity was Mr. Duke acting for Dr. Lee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. He was acting as agent of Dr. Lee, as I </P>
<P>understood it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Mr. Duke was not a lawyer or certified public </P>
<P>accountant, was he?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No, he was not.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. He was a public relations man?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I understood from Mr. Duke's discussion that he </P>
<P>handled public relations matters for clients, that he conducted </P>
<P>investigations for them and that sort of thing.</P>
<P>    It was in that capacity that he was engaged by Dr. Lee.</P>
<P>    I might say for your record that he was engaged by Dr. Lee </P>
<P>and not by me, and that I never had any discussions concerning </P>
<P>it with the view to having Dr. Lee engage me, if that is what </P>
<P>you want to know; none whatsoever.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Have you ever had any financial transactions </P>
<P>direct or indirect, with anybody connected with the tax </P>
<P>division of the Department of Justice?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Now, what kind of question is that? What do you </P>
<P>mean; financial transactions direct or indirect with anybody in </P>
<P>the Department of Justice?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Is there something that isn't clear about the </P>
<P>question?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No, I don't understand it. What do you mean </P>
<P>financial transaction? Do you mean did I ever in any way lend </P>
<P>anybody money or anything like that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Or pay them anything?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. That is right.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The answer is, no, not of any kind.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Did you cash any checks?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No.</P>
<P>    For anyone in the Department of Justice?</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Certainly not. On that score I can be almost </P>
<P>positive. I have no recollection of it.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. What kind of financial transactions are you </P>
<P>trying to rule out?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I was merely saying, for heaven's sake, if </P>
<P>somebody over there along the line wanted to borrow ten bucks </P>
<P>from me or something like that--no one did, Senator, but I lend </P>
<P>people money right and left.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. You can say categorically you have had no </P>
<P>transactions, of any kind?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I am confident of that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And would you make the same answer with the </P>
<P>Bureau of Internal Revenue?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And how about Mr. Russell Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I have had no transactions with Mr. Russell </P>
<P>Duke apart from one matter, which I brought to the attention of </P>
<P>Mr. Flanagan and Mr. Collier when I brought the papers up here.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Will you bring that to the attention of the </P>
<P>committee.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I certainly will.</P>
<P>    On June 22, 1949, Mr. Duke came to my office, he appeared </P>
<P>to be as near down and out as I have ever seen him. He also put </P>
<P>out a very bold front.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What was the date again?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. July 22, 1949, as I remember it.</P>
<P>    He said that his boy was seriously ill, that his wife had </P>
<P>to go to a hospital, that he had a hotel in Washington, that he </P>
<P>was flat broke and that he had no way to get back to Portland, </P>
<P>Oregon.</P>
<P>    As a matter of fact, he broke down and cried in the office.</P>
<P>    I said, ``Russell, what can I do for you?''</P>
<P>    He said, ``I want to borrow some money.''</P>
<P>    I said, ``How much do you feel that would be necessary for </P>
<P>you to take care of your problem?''</P>
<P>    He said ``I would like to have five hundred dollars.''</P>
<P>    Well, I didn't have $500 myself certainly to lend him.</P>
<P>    I discussed it with my partners as to whether or not we </P>
<P>felt that we should, in the circumstances, lend the money to </P>
<P>him.</P>
<P>    He said he would pay it back when he got back to Portland.</P>
<P>    We decided to do it. We wrote a check payable to him, drawn </P>
<P>on our firm account. He said he would like to have the cash. I </P>
<P>had him endorse it, one of the secretaries went over to the </P>
<P>bank and got the cash and gave it to him.</P>
<P>    That was entered as a loan to Russell Duke on our original </P>
<P>check stub on July 22, 1949. That is the only financial </P>
<P>relationship of any kind that I have ever had with Russell </P>
<P>Duke.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did he ever repay that $500?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. He did not, and I asked him about it on a </P>
<P>couple of occasions thereafter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. When did you last ask him about it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I think the last time I asked him about it, if </P>
<P>I can remember--well, I couldn't recall the specific date </P>
<P>because he was flitting in and out of Washington so much I </P>
<P>don't remember exactly.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Can you approximate the date for us?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I couldn't give you any definite date.</P>
<P>    It might have been late 1950, something like that. I know </P>
<P>he got a very serious injury in a mine explosion and he called </P>
<P>me from the hospital bed to tell me he was in bad shape and had </P>
<P>to have plastic surgery and that kind of thing.</P>
<P>    I didn't have the heart to ask him them, so I remember that </P>
<P>was 1951.</P>
<P>    So it must have been sometime in late 1950.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. When was the last you saw Mr. Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I would say, Senator--and this is hard to </P>
<P>remember--but I would say the last time I probably saw him was </P>
<P>in maybe May of 1951.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. When did you last talk to him on the </P>
<P>telephone?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I think the last time I talked with him on the </P>
<P>telephone, as I remember, was when he called me from the </P>
<P>hospital after the explosion had wrecked him pretty much.</P>
<P>    He indicated he was in rough shape, and wanted me to know </P>
<P>how he was getting along. I was also nice to him, kind to him.</P>
<P>    As a matter of fact, let us put it straight on the record. </P>
<P>I was a young lawyer and I was grateful to Mr. Duke. I am still </P>
<P>grateful to him. I have nothing mean to say about that man. He </P>
<P>was kind to me and I appreciated this. And every one of these </P>
<P>cases was handled legitimately on the merits of any cases that </P>
<P>ever were.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. That last telephone call in 1951 was a </P>
<P>hospital bed call, was it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Senator, I just can't remember, I am sure if I </P>
<P>checked my record of telephone calls----</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Was it earlier, or later.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I can't remember. It might have been later.</P>
<P>    I just don't remember when the mine explosion was.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. It was 1952.</P>
<P>    Have you any correspondence with him since 1952?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That I can't remember.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. How carefully did you examine the background </P>
<P>or record of Mr. Duke before you became associated with him in </P>
<P>whatever capacity you were associated with him?</P>
<P>    You were an old FBI agent so you did a pretty careful job?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is right. That is one of the very </P>
<P>embarrassing aspects of the whole thing, there is no question </P>
<P>about that.</P>
<P>    I hope none of you gentlemen are ever comparably victims, </P>
<P>but unfortunately, my foresight is not as good as some people's </P>
<P>hindsight.</P>
<P>    My law office is open, my door is open, anybody can come in </P>
<P>at any time. Here came a man to my office with one of the most </P>
<P>highly respected men I know even today. I took him for face </P>
<P>value, for what he was. I went out to Portland Oregon, to </P>
<P>handle the hearing in his Lee matter. I met his wife and I met </P>
<P>this man's children, and I was in his home.</P>
<P>    He lived in a respectable part of Portland.</P>
<P>    I made three speeches in Oregon, two at the Montriomah </P>
<P>Hotel. The best people in the city were there. He seemed to </P>
<P>know them all well by their first names. He belonged to nice </P>
<P>clubs, he took me to the club for dinner.</P>
<P>    I had every reason in the world to believe he was a </P>
<P>legitimate individual.</P>
<P>    Insofar as inquiring into the man's background, I wish now </P>
<P>I could conduct a complete FBI investigation on everybody that </P>
<P>walks in my office, but I imagine if I had to do that I </P>
<P>wouldn't practice too much law.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Why do you wish you had done it now?</P>
<P>    What did you discover subsequently?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Senator, I am sure you are not so naive as not </P>
<P>to realize what this sort of thing does to a professional man. </P>
<P>I mean you can appreciate it by realizing, if you have a good </P>
<P>and fine clientele, what this sort of thing does.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Have you subsequently discovered things in </P>
<P>Mr. Duke's record that you wish you had known about earlier?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I understand Mr. Duke has a criminal record, I </P>
<P>understand that he sought to take his own life. I understand </P>
<P>that he had a terrific fight in which he threw his wife down </P>
<P>the stairs and she divorced him. I understand he was indicted </P>
<P>for perjury and running up and down the West Coast trying to </P>
<P>sell some fantastic story for $30,000 or $500,000, or what </P>
<P>anybody would give him, drunk as the lord. I know all that, and </P>
<P>that is what I am talking about. Certainly I wished I had known </P>
<P>that.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. When did you learn about that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Insofar as the later matters that are </P>
<P>discussed, I didn't learn about that until relatively recently. </P>
<P>I knew that he was indicted by reason of a newspaper account </P>
<P>that appeared in the local paper about a year ago, I guess it </P>
<P>was. And I know that he sought to take his own life because the </P>
<P>same account treated of that.</P>
<P>    I think the matter of his domestic difficulties was also </P>
<P>related in a clipping that I have, as I remember.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Is it a recent clipping, or how long ago?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. It was a year ago, in connection with the time </P>
<P>of his indictment. There was a story in connection with it </P>
<P>then.</P>
<P>    Insofar as having the record is concerned, I think that </P>
<P>that goes back to late 1950, as I remember, or late 1949 </P>
<P>perhaps. I remember asking him about it. He was in the office </P>
<P>and I said ``Russell, have you ever been arrested?''</P>
<P>    He was evasive for a moment and then he said ``Yes, Yes, I </P>
<P>was.'' He said ``I would like to tell you the story.'' And he </P>
<P>related the entire story.</P>
<P>    He said that when he was a young man, just out of the navy, </P>
<P>he was hitchhiking across the country. He was picked up, he </P>
<P>said, as he told me, by a driver of a car, and the police </P>
<P>stopped them. He said that he was a confused young man and that </P>
<P>they arrested both of them for some kind of robbery. As I </P>
<P>remember it, and he said he was a young, confused ``punk,'' as </P>
<P>he put it, didn't understand what the situation was, didn't </P>
<P>know how to defend himself, and he went to the penitentiary in </P>
<P>the state of Iowa. He told me of course, all the details about </P>
<P>it, which I don't remember.</P>
<P>    He said when Governor Gillette, now Senator Gillette--at </P>
<P>the time he was governor--ultimately obtained the facts, </P>
<P>pardoned him. That was the story.</P>
<P>    He presented that phase of it to me.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. Did you ever ask Mr. Bobbitt, who was an </P>
<P>old-time friend and colleague of yours how come he didn't give </P>
<P>you the background of this man he brought to your office at </P>
<P>that time?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Well, I don't recall instances in which I have </P>
<P>had an opportunity to chat with Mr. Bobbitt about it since the </P>
<P>time that I knew these things, certainly.</P>
<P>    I am sure that Mr. Bobbitt didn't know it.</P>
<P>    Senator Mundt. I thought you FBI agents have a habit of </P>
<P>looking pretty carefully into records of people.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Perhaps we are given too much credit, Senator.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Tell me about this $500 loan which has never been </P>
<P>repaid. Have you ever treated that in any way on your income </P>
<P>tax return?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No, I haven't. I think he will pay me if he </P>
<P>gets it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You have not charged him for it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No. And I wouldn't push anybody. He has had his </P>
<P>troubles. I am not going to condemn him. You people pass </P>
<P>judgment on him, me or anybody else.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. My only question was how you treated it on the </P>
<P>income tax return.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, I know.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Now, you mentioned the names of two people in the </P>
<P>Department of Justice, Mr. Lockley, is that correct?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is correct.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. John Lockley? Is he the man with whom you had </P>
<P>conferences with two of these cases?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Had you known Mr. Lockley before you went to him </P>
<P>in connection with these cases?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Mr. Lockley was a classmate of mine at </P>
<P>Georgetown.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Had you known him following your graduation from </P>
<P>Georgetown?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I could almost say this positively, but you can </P>
<P>never be sure, I don't think I saw Mr. Lockley from the day I </P>
<P>graduated from Georgetown in 1949, to the day I held a </P>
<P>conference with him on the Blumenthal case. I have no </P>
<P>recollection of seeing him in the meantime.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. There was another name you mentioned; Colonel </P>
<P>Swearingen.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, Colonel Swearingen.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Had you known him prior to this conference on the </P>
<P>tax case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You had never met him before?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Have you seen him since?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, I have seen him since.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You have seen him since?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes. I spoke at his church.</P>
<P>    He invited me to come out and speak to his class. He is a </P>
<P>Sunday school teacher and I went out and talked to his class.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Was that as a result of the meeting?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I got acquainted with the gentleman and over a </P>
<P>period of time I met him from time to time.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. How soon after your conference in connection with </P>
<P>this tax case did this acquaintance come forward?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The conference was in April of 1949, I guess, </P>
<P>the first one, and I guess I spoke at his church a year after, </P>
<P>two years later. I don't remember exactly.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you see him between the April 1949 conference </P>
<P>and the time you went to his church to talk?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I must have seen him, sure.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. On how many occasions?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't know. Colonel Swearingen is very much </P>
<P>interested, or was very much interested--he was with the </P>
<P>Nuremberg trial, as I remember, and he was very much interested </P>
<P>in a problem that I still regard as a great problem.</P>
<P>    I have a lot to say on that myself--unfortunately usually </P>
<P>on the unpopular side, the subject of communism.</P>
<P>    On the basis of that we chatted quite a bit because he was </P>
<P>interested in the subject, and we both knew a little about it, </P>
<P>I think.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What do you mean he was on the unpopular side?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I said I was on the unpopular side.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You were on the unpopular side?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. When after this conference in connection with the </P>
<P>tax case, did you next see Colonel Swearingen?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I couldn't answer your question.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Could you estimate for us, a week, two weeks, two </P>
<P>months?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I would call him on the status of the matter </P>
<P>periodically.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. When did you first see him in connection with </P>
<P>things other than this particular tax matter?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I would say that in so for as the personal </P>
<P>contact with him is concerned, I recall none other than the </P>
<P>time I met him at his church out at Connecticut Avenue and </P>
<P>spoke to his Sunday School class.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. That covers the time from when you first met him, </P>
<P>up to the present day?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is right, as far as I can remember.</P>
<P>    Counsel, I have had a pretty rough existence. I have been </P>
<P>counsel to a pretty rough session on the Hill. I set up an </P>
<P>organization of three thousand men in OPS. I have spoken all </P>
<P>over the United States, I have met thousands of people. I can't </P>
<P>remember specifically when I saw this individual or some other </P>
<P>individual. To the best of my knowledge, that is the only time </P>
<P>I have seen him.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. The only time to, to the best of your knowledge, </P>
<P>the only time you have seen him was at the church you went out </P>
<P>to speak, that covers from the time you first met him?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is a qualified answer. I might have bumped </P>
<P>into him in the house or in front of the Justice Department.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Have you ever been to his home?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. He hasn't been to yours?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Have you ever spoken any place else under </P>
<P>arrangements made with him?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No; not to the best of my knowledge. I might </P>
<P>have, though, I just don't remember.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You have no recollection?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. We have talked about this subpoena which as </P>
<P>served upon you calling for the production of all records </P>
<P>relating to any transactions between Mr. Duke and yourself, and </P>
<P>you have told us that you have searched the files of your </P>
<P>office and made compliance with the subpoena.</P>
<P>    Let me ask you: what is the usual routine in your law </P>
<P>office when letters come in relating to pending matters?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I know what it is now. What it was in 1949 I </P>
<P>certainly can't be sure of, or 1950, or any other time during </P>
<P>the period we are talking about. I can tell you what our </P>
<P>routine is at the present time.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Let us talk about 1949 and 1950.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I have no recollection.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Would you want to tell us whether or not you </P>
<P>think correspondence and papers in connection with cases were </P>
<P>retained?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I would certainly say that any correspondence </P>
<P>relating to any official matter in the office was retained, </P>
<P>certainly.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Would you customarily retain correspondence that </P>
<P>you received at your office?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Normally, certainly; unless it was strictly a </P>
<P>personal letter that had no business in the files of the </P>
<P>office.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What would you do with those letters?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I might tear them up, take them home with me. I </P>
<P>might do any number of things with them. I got a letter just </P>
<P>this morning from a personal friend that has nothing to do with </P>
<P>the office.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. In complying with the subpoena, did you go </P>
<P>through your personal correspondence?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I think I asked them to check my personal file, </P>
<P>yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. So, in other words, every source----</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. We did the best we could. One girl worked all </P>
<P>night long on this thing to comply with the ``forthwith'' </P>
<P>feature of it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Are there any letters that you received from Mr. </P>
<P>Duke that you did not produce in response to the subpoena?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. None that I know of, certainly.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Mr. Chairman, may I have shown to the witness a </P>
<P>letter dated September 5, 1949, addressed to Mr. Morgan, signed </P>
<P>by Russell W. Duke.</P>
<P>    I will identify it for the record as a letter dated </P>
<P>September 25, 1949, addressed to Welch, Mott and Morgan, 710 </P>
<P>Erickson Building, 14th Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C., </P>
<P>beginning: ``Dear Ed''--and with a typewritten signature </P>
<P>``Russell W. Duke.''</P>
<P>    It is a three-page letter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Do you want me to read this?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I would like you to just glance at it first and </P>
<P>tell us whether or not you recognize that as a letter you </P>
<P>received from Mr. Duke.</P>
<P>    Then having told us that, I would like you to read the </P>
<P>letter from beginning to end.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Do you have a question?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Have you read that letter?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Do you recognize that as a letter you received?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. To the best of my knowledge, I never saw that </P>
<P>before.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Can you tell us whether or not you received the </P>
<P>original of that letter?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I certainly can say that, to the best of my </P>
<P>knowledge and belief, I never saw that before.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You never saw that before?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Correct. To the best of my knowledge and </P>
<P>belief, I never saw that before.</P>
<P>    I recall some of matter mentions in there, I mean this </P>
<P>Bremen matter that he mentions, I remember that situation, but </P>
<P>this letter right here and the facts relating in it do not </P>
<P>click with me at all, and it is my considered opinion that I </P>
<P>never saw it before.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. It is your considered opinion that you never did </P>
<P>see that letter before, is that right?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is right.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Let me ask you: if you had received such a </P>
<P>letter, would that have been in the files of your office?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Certainly.</P>
<P>    Senator Dirksen. The hearing will recess until two o'clock. </P>
<P>[Whereupon at 11:50 a.m. a recess was taken until 2:00 p.m. the </P>
<P>same day.]</P>

<P>                           Afternoon Session</P>

<P>    [2:00 p.m.] Senator Dirksen. The hearing will resume, Mr. </P>
<P>Cohn, you may proceed.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan, is it still your testimony that you never </P>
<P>received this letter which was shown to you just before the </P>
<P>recess, referring to the one dated September 5, 1949.</P>

<P>            TESTIMONY OF EDWARD P. MORGAN (RESUMED)</P>

<P>    Mr. Morgan. My testimony is that to the best of my </P>
<P>knowledge and belief I have never seen that letter before you </P>
<P>showed it to me.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You read it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I believe you said that the matters in it are </P>
<P>familiar to you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. One of the matters is, particularly.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Are there any matters mentioned in here with </P>
<P>which you have no familiarity?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. May I see the letter again?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Of course.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Now, I certainly am familiar with this matter </P>
<P>that he refers to as the Bremen matter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What is the next one?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. When I say I am familiar with it, I am not </P>
<P>familiar with it in contemplation of what he says.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. How about the top of the second page?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That to me is Greek.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Would you read it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan [reading]:</P>

<P>    I have a lot of cases in California that I have to do a lot </P>
<P>of bird-dogging on, and I hate like sin to go down there and </P>
<P>bird-dog without clicking on a few. I wish that you would be </P>
<P>able to secure some talent, as I could use some hay. I am </P>
<P>letting things quiet down on the coast by lying dormant and </P>
<P>putting more effort in lining up the coming campaign. I assure </P>
<P>you that the request you made of me on the phone that Senator </P>
<P>Morse will go along 100 per cent because the longer you get to </P>
<P>know him, the more you will learn that he is a man of his word; </P>
<P>but he has had so much to do, and, as I understand, he has been </P>
<P>given assurance that you are No. 1 on the list. In all the time </P>
<P>I have known Senator Morse, I have never known him to deviate </P>
<P>or to say something that is not so. He either tells you in the </P>
<P>beginning nothing doing, or he will go along. I am willing to </P>
<P>gamble with you in any shape, form or manner that you will be </P>
<P>in as soon as the other chap resigns. I sincerely hope that the </P>
<P>cases that are back there clear up so that we can start on </P>
<P>something else. Again I repeat, ``I can use the hay.''</P>

<P>    Mr. Cohn. Regarding that paragraph, which contains a </P>
<P>reference to a request you made to Mr. Duke over the telephone, </P>
<P>what is that about?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't know.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you ever ask Senator Morse through Mr. Duke </P>
<P>or anyone else to intercede in your behalf?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Through Mr. Duke? I have never asked of Senator </P>
<P>Morse anything. If you want to know through my own personal </P>
<P>acquaintance with Senator Morse, that is another question. If </P>
<P>you would like me to answer that, I would be glad to.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Have you ever been together with Mr. Duke and </P>
<P>Senator Morse?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. It is possible. I recall no particular </P>
<P>situation, but it is certainly possible, because I was up on </P>
<P>the Hill and it could have happened, certainly. But I don't </P>
<P>recall any specific incident.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Was Senator Morse ever in your office?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. If he had been, I think I would remember it. I </P>
<P>just don't remember it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I assume that in view of this answer, your answer </P>
<P>would be that you don't recall any occasion when you, Senator </P>
<P>Morse and Mr. Duke, the three of you, were together in your </P>
<P>office?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I have no recollection. It could have occurred, </P>
<P>certainly, because I have a great admiration for Senator Morse. </P>
<P>I have visited in his home. He certainly could have been in my </P>
<P>office. I just don't remember the situation to which you refer, </P>
<P>if it occurred.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What do you think this business of ``100 per cent </P>
<P>behind you'' refers to?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. As I say, counsel, I have no recollection of </P>
<P>ever having seen this. If I had seen such a letter as this, I </P>
<P>would have come to one of two conclusions. Either the man who </P>
<P>wrote it was drunk and on goofballs, or he was demented. One or </P>
<P>the other. I have no recollection of having seen this. It is </P>
<P>just so much Greek to me.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did Senator Morse ever attempt to obtain any kind </P>
<P>of a position for you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Senator Morse has to my deep appreciation </P>
<P>endorsed me for positions, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you ever discuss his endorsement of you with </P>
<P>any position with Mr. Duke, or did Mr. Duke ever discuss it </P>
<P>with you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. It is conceivable, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Do you have any recollection?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I have no specific recollection.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You can't tell us whether any such discussion </P>
<P>took place or didn't?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No. If you have any specific occasion, maybe it </P>
<P>will refresh my recollection. I recall none. I took this man at </P>
<P>face value. I talked freely with him. I talked with him before </P>
<P>the atmosphere of suspicion of your neighbor occurred. I talked </P>
<P>to him openly. I wrote to him frequently. I looked at the </P>
<P>correspondence that is four or five years old, and I hope </P>
<P>everybody's correspondence of four or five years ago will stand </P>
<P>up as well.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Do you know whether or not Mr. Duke knew Senator </P>
<P>Morse at that time?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I think perhaps he did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You say you think perhaps he did. Do you know </P>
<P>whether or not he did? Can't we get a categorical answer?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I am sure he knew Senator Morse.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Then your answer is yes?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes. But you ask me to make categorical </P>
<P>assertions about what somebody else knew. I say I take for </P>
<P>granted he knew him. I am sure.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. That was my original question.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't think there was any question about </P>
<P>that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. That is all we want to know.</P>
<P>    Do you recall any occasion when you, Senator Morse and Duke </P>
<P>were together?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I remember no specific occasion, but we might </P>
<P>have been. If you have in mind any situation you may ask me.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I will ask you any questions that occur to me, </P>
<P>thank you. The word ``talent'' is used in this letter. Do you </P>
<P>know what Mr. Duke was referring to by that word?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I certainly don't. I would say it is a </P>
<P>screwball expression. I can say this certainly, that I recall </P>
<P>one type of situation in which Mr. Duke was interested in my </P>
<P>offering him some help and assistance. During this particular </P>
<P>period I was in association with a very, very wealthy Texas oil </P>
<P>man, and we were drilling some wells in north Louisiana, and </P>
<P>Duke was always wanting to have some oil proposition that he </P>
<P>might present to some of his friends out there. Now, if he had </P>
<P>used such an expression to me, which I don't remember, that </P>
<P>would certainly be the only thing to which I might attach such </P>
<P>an expression.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You mean this oil deal?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No, he was wanting some oil situation that he </P>
<P>might present to clients of his, and friends.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. How do you tie the word ``talent'' up with an oil </P>
<P>deal?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I say I can't explain it other than if such an </P>
<P>expression ever were used in contemplation of his wanting </P>
<P>something of me, that is the only time I ever remember that he </P>
<P>asked me for anything, that is, in connection with the idea of </P>
<P>some oil deal.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. He asked you for your assistance or work as </P>
<P>counsel in connection with various tax cases.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I have explained that completely. I am trying </P>
<P>to talk to you now in terms of this expression here, which is </P>
<P>meaningless to me.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Couldn't that refer to obtaining tax cases?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I suppose it could refer to anything. I never </P>
<P>saw the letter to the best of my knowledge and belief.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What is there that makes you think it might refer </P>
<P>to any oil deal?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Nothing at all.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. That is just pure conjecture on your part?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Sure.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You brought up the oil deal. What was your </P>
<P>connection? Do I understand you had an interest in oil wells?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. That was not a lawyer-client matter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No, this was an investment matter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Could you tell us who the partners were?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. In the drilling venture?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I would like to ask the chairman if that has </P>
<P>any pertinence in this proceeding, that is, who my partners </P>
<P>might have been in a business venture in the southwestern part </P>
<P>of the United States in contemplation of this proceeding. The </P>
<P>only reason I am reluctant to do it is that I am disinclined to </P>
<P>throw the name out of somebody who has nothing to do with this.</P>
<P>    Senator Dirksen. Unless it were foundation for something </P>
<P>that counsel might want to ask later that is pertinent to the </P>
<P>objectives sought here, I doubt very much----</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I would be glad to tell you, if you would like </P>
<P>to know, who it is, and then you can put it on the record if </P>
<P>you wish. I am not trying to withhold anything, certainly.</P>
<P>    Senator Dirksen. It may not be relevant to the inquiry at </P>
<P>this point.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. May I ask this, Mr. Chairman. Would you tell us </P>
<P>this: When did Mr. Duke first talk to you about participation </P>
<P>in this oil deal or in any oil venture?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Every time he was in the office after I was in </P>
<P>any way engaged in the business, he would bring it up. We have </P>
<P>in our office a picture of a gusher coming in. It is well </P>
<P>known. My friends here in the bureau know about it. Everybody </P>
<P>knows I have been interested in oil. It is no secret.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did he ever talk with any of your partners in any </P>
<P>of these oil ventures or in this particular oil venture?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I would say no.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You are quite sure of that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I know of none.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. No communication, direct or indirect, with anyone </P>
<P>associated in any of these oil ventures?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is correct. I remember Mr. Duke had some </P>
<P>information, so he thought, about possible oil production in </P>
<P>the state of Oregon, and he indicated an area out there where </P>
<P>he felt that some kind of work had been done to indicate the </P>
<P>presence of oil. He communicated with me about it, either </P>
<P>personally or by letter, and I wrote him a letter back </P>
<P>concerning it. I think I have supplied you with a copy of the </P>
<P>letter--I don't know--with respect to that matter. But insofar </P>
<P>as communicating with any of my associates, I don't think any </P>
<P>of them know him. I am sure they don't.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did he know their names?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Possibly, very possibly.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You are familiar with those terms, about the </P>
<P>psychological effect, on the last page of that letter, </P>
<P>referring to the talent situation. Would you re-read that </P>
<P>sentence, please?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. On the last page?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. The last page, I believe.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. ``As you know,''</P>
<P>    I am reading from page three of this letter:</P>

<P>the talent is plentiful and it is a psychological effect when </P>
<P>one comes in cold and tells a person what he knows about him. </P>
<P>So I hope sincerely that you will be able to secure some talent </P>
<P>for me.</P>

<P>    Mr. Cohn. Does that still sound like reference to </P>
<P>participating in an oil deal?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Now, counsel, let us be fair about this </P>
<P>proceeding. You asked me, as we went down this sentence here, </P>
<P>this paragraph, what this meant. I told you that it was </P>
<P>meaningless to me. In the context of your examination the idea </P>
<P>was indicated as to what Mr. Duke might have at any time </P>
<P>requested of me, and I tried to tell you honestly the only </P>
<P>thing I can ever remember is that he requested an oil deal.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Your testimony was that it was conjecture that </P>
<P>the word ``talent'' might refer to this oil deal. My question </P>
<P>to you now is, having read this last paragraph, do you think </P>
<P>the word ``talent'' had reference to an oil deal?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't think it does here. I don't assume it </P>
<P>does back here. It is just meaningless to me.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Your testimony is that the last paragraph is </P>
<P>meaningless to you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Exactly.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Do you ever recall having used the word </P>
<P>``talent'' in any conversations with Mr. Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. It is an expression that I would not use. I </P>
<P>just would have no recollection of it. I might have used the </P>
<P>word ``talent'' certainly in a conversation, but in no </P>
<P>significance as we might think of it here.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. It was never given any secondary meaning by you </P>
<P>or by Mr. Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Correct, by me. I don't know what meanings Mr. </P>
<P>Duke might put on anything.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you ever have any conversation with Mr. Duke </P>
<P>in the course of which there was any arrangement concerning use </P>
<P>of code words or secondary meanings or phrases to imply certain </P>
<P>things that you did not say directly?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I never had any relationship involving the use </P>
<P>of code words with Mr. Duke.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. How about the rest of the question?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Repeat it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Could we have the last question read, please?</P>
<P>    [Question read by the reporter.]</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No, I would say there was no such arrangement.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Let me ask you this, Mr. Morgan. Did you ever </P>
<P>have any interest in any way in any horses owned by Senator </P>
<P>Morse?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You did not?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you know that Senator Morse owned any horses?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I knew that Senator Morse got kicked by a horse </P>
<P>and broke his jaw, and I knew he was in an accident on the West </P>
<P>Coast when he was riding in some rodeo or something. I never </P>
<P>had any interest in any of Senator Morse's horses.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Now, Mr. Chairman, may I display to the witness a </P>
<P>letter which I will identify for the record as a letter dated </P>
<P>September 10, 1949, addressed to Mr. Ed Morgan, Welsh, Mott &amp; </P>
<P>Morgan, beginning, ``Dear Ed,'' a two page letter with the </P>
<P>typed signature, ``R. W. Duke.''</P>
<P>    Senator Dirksen. The letter, as identified, which was </P>
<P>submitted for the record as Exhibit No. 1 yesterday, will be </P>
<P>displayed to the witness.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Would you read it and tell us whether or not you </P>
<P>can identify that as a letter you received?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I have no recollection of the letter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You have no recollection of it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You can't tell us whether you received it or not?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No, I cannot tell you whether I did or did not.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. If you had received that, would that have been in </P>
<P>your files?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Normally it would appear in the files, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And a search of your file has not disclosed the </P>
<P>letter?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Unless it was among the letters that I </P>
<P>presented to you; unless it is among the letters I presented </P>
<P>pursuant to the subpoena.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. It was in neither the prior letters nor these </P>
<P>that you presented?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You have read that letter and are familiar with </P>
<P>the contents?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, I have no recollection of that letter. I </P>
<P>just don't recall it, that is all.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. May I read the letter for the record?</P>
<P>    Senator Dirksen. The letter may be read.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn [reading]:</P>

<P>    Dear Ed: Since my conversation with you over the phone </P>
<P>regarding what Senator Morse, yourself, and myself discussed in </P>
<P>your office, I can only repeat as I stated in my previous </P>
<P>letter, Senator Morse, his integrity, honesty, and sincerity is </P>
<P>something to be highly admired and respected. At no time have I </P>
<P>ever known him to make an idle promise. I shall see that you </P>
<P>will be given assurance in person immediately after the 12th of </P>
<P>this month complying with the request you made of me.</P>
<P>    Talent, Ed, is what I want. I am going to make my tour of </P>
<P>the South (incidentally, Nevada and Idaho are good territory) </P>
<P>and make one complete thrust to bring all the talent I possibly </P>
<P>can to Washington.</P>
<P>    I understand there are 23 applications in Oregon for </P>
<P>television. Can you confirm that?</P>
<P>    Well, Ed, oil lands in Oregon are going to surprise the </P>
<P>nation. In delving through old records in the capitol recently, </P>
<P>I ran across a survey and drilling tests that were made in a </P>
<P>certain county by the Texas Oil Company, and their findings are </P>
<P>so important that they will elicit from anyone who would go </P>
<P>over them a thrilling surprise. At the time of the Teapot Dome </P>
<P>scandal, Texas Oil Company, in conjunction with Sinclair </P>
<P>Company, was contemplating stealing the leases for this </P>
<P>particular area; sank seven wells, each of which were </P>
<P>producing; wells; and each well was capped off as soon as Fall, </P>
<P>Dohney and Daugherty were indicted, and it has been a dead duck </P>
<P>ever since. People filed homesteads on this particular land and </P>
<P>have since cut out the forests for lumber purposes and have </P>
<P>abandoned these lands. They are available from the county for </P>
<P>the price of delinquent taxes, which amount to about $200 per </P>
<P>160 acre sections. If you can get a company to drill on this </P>
<P>established oil land, would you be interested in my writing you </P>
<P>in as a full partner in owning these various sections. As I </P>
<P>stated above, your cost would be negligible. Let me know at the </P>
<P>earliest possible date, and I will exercise the auctions.</P>
<P>    How are the horses running? I refer to Sir Laurel Guy, the </P>
<P>Oakland owned horse, and the Sacramento owned horse.</P>
<P>    With best personal regards, I remain, Sincerely yours, R. </P>
<P>W. Duke.</P>

<P>    Referring to this paragraph, ``How are the horses running? </P>
<P>I refer to Sir Laurel Guy, the Oakland owned horse, and the </P>
<P>Sacramento owned horse,'' what does that paragraph mean to you?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. As you read it to me now, I certainly do know </P>
<P>what that meant. It would mean the Guy Schafer case and the </P>
<P>Wilcoxon case. Wilcoxon was from Sacramento.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Was the Schafer case in Oakland?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, he was from Oakland.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. So, in other words, your explanation of this </P>
<P>paragraph is that the reference is to these two cases.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Right. That is certainly what I would interpret </P>
<P>that to mean, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Was it a usual practice not to refer to these </P>
<P>cases by their regular names, but to employ a device such as </P>
<P>this?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Certainly in any correspondence I ever had I </P>
<P>would utilize the name of the individual.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You have no recollection of another name or a </P>
<P>code name or any such?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No. You asked me earlier if there were any code </P>
<P>relationships, and I said no.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You feel if you would have received this letter </P>
<P>you would have known what it would refer to?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I recognize it immediately, sure. Sure.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. This would indicate, too, would it not, that you </P>
<P>had received in inquiry, or that you had received this letter </P>
<P>from Mr. Duke concerning the Schaeffer case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, certainly. I think I stated this morning </P>
<P>that he inquired of me several times about the status of the </P>
<P>matter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I don't think so. I think your testimony was you </P>
<P>had no recollection as to whether he had or not.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I had no specific recollection. This well might </P>
<P>be one instance where he certainly did.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Do you have any recollection of any inquiry </P>
<P>whatsoever by Mr. Duke to yourself concerning the Schafer case </P>
<P>after the original meeting between Mr. Duke, Mr. Bobbitt and </P>
<P>yourself?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I have no specific recollection concerning the </P>
<P>matter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I don't mean that you recall a specific date. I </P>
<P>mean, do you recall any communication, oral or written, to you </P>
<P>by Mr. Duke making any inquiry about that case following the </P>
<P>first meeting?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't recall it, no, but this letter which </P>
<P>you have in your hand, when you read that paragraph to me, had </P>
<P>I received it, that is the construction that I would have given </P>
<P>it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Now, going back to the very beginning of the </P>
<P>letter, ``Since my conversation with you over the phone </P>
<P>regarding what Senator Morse, yourself and myself discussed in </P>
<P>your office,'' does that refresh your recollection as to </P>
<P>whether or not there was a meeting between Senator Morse, Mr. </P>
<P>Duke and yourself in your office?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't recall it. I don't recall the meeting. </P>
<P>It might well have occurred.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You can't say whether or not a meeting occurred?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I have no specific recollection. That does not </P>
<P>refresh my memory.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I think you told us before if Senator Morse had </P>
<P>been in your office, you would probably remember.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I think so, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And you have no recollection?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No specific recollection. I would be willing to </P>
<P>concede that Senator Morse had been in my office forty times, </P>
<P>and I had talked with him and Mr. Duke in my office forty times </P>
<P>if it were regarded as pertinent to this committee. I just have </P>
<P>no recollection on the matter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Now, do you know what request that you had made </P>
<P>concerning which Senator Morse was asked to intercede is being </P>
<P>referred to in this letter from Mr. Duke to yourself?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No. It does not strike a chord in my mind. What </P>
<P>is the date of the letter again?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Dated September 10, 1949. Is there any position </P>
<P>you were seeking at that time?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. September 10, 1949?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Yes, sir.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I recall none at the moment. I might well have </P>
<P>been. The only thing I am trying to think of in my mind there </P>
<P>was one position in which I was very much interested, and I </P>
<P>can't think of it in terms of that particular date, and that is </P>
<P>the Federal Communications Commission. I was interested in the </P>
<P>commission.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. In an appointment to the Federal Communications </P>
<P>Commission?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you ever discuss your proposed appointment </P>
<P>with Mr. Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I might very well have.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Do you have any recollection of ever having </P>
<P>discussed it with him?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No, I have no specific recollection.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you ever discuss it with Senator Morse?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I think he wrote a letter of endorsement for </P>
<P>me, as I remember.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did Mr. Duke have anything to do with that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I would say in all probability I had </P>
<P>communicated directly with Senator Morse on the matter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You have no recollection of having discussed it </P>
<P>together with Senator Morse and Mr. Duke, is that correct?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. It could have happened. I just have no </P>
<P>recollection on the matter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Now, this morning you were telling us a tax case </P>
<P>involving Dr. Lee, is that correct?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I believe your testimony was that Mr. Duke was </P>
<P>sort of acting as Dr. Lee's agent, and that he brought Dr. Lee </P>
<P>into your office in Washington, is that right?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is correct.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you know that they were coming down?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes. He called and asked me if I would try to </P>
<P>help Dr. Lee in connection with his problem. I wrote back and </P>
<P>suggested that they send me additional information in order </P>
<P>that I might determine what might be done in the situation. I </P>
<P>don't think I was ever supplied that information. He and Dr. </P>
<P>Lee came on to Washington. There is no question that I know of </P>
<P>Dr. Lee's case, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Then your testimony was that you took Mr. Duke </P>
<P>and Dr. Lee over to the Bureau of Internal Revenue and first </P>
<P>went to the technical section.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. As I remember, we went to the technical staff.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And then to the comptroller's office?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No, the collector's office.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And your testimony was that was your last </P>
<P>communication with the Washington office of the Bureau of </P>
<P>Internal Revenue?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. With the Washington office?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Yes, with reference to Dr. Lee's case.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Certainly not the last communication--official </P>
<P>communication--concerning the case.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. With the Washington office?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Oh, no. I would want to check my file to find </P>
<P>out what correspondence I had officially relating to the case. </P>
<P>There well might have been correspondence. I think particularly </P>
<P>one instance in which I think the man I talked to over at the </P>
<P>Bureau of Internal Revenue was Mr. Krag Reddish, in connection </P>
<P>with the matter. As to correspondence with the bureau, no, I </P>
<P>never made any statement that I had not corresponded with them </P>
<P>on the case, certainly not, because I did correspond with the </P>
<P>bureau. I proceeded to file a formal tax court petition in the </P>
<P>case. I tried to get an early conference arrangement. The man </P>
<P>had a jeopardy assessment that he wanted to get lifted if he </P>
<P>possibly could.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. That is the case in which you said you had this </P>
<P>original conference in Washington, you were advised to file the </P>
<P>petition, and the petition was filed out west, and the case was </P>
<P>compromised out there is that correct?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No. The case was forwarded here to me for </P>
<P>approval of the compromise.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. But it was compromised out west, and the </P>
<P>compromise was then forwarded to you, is that right?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I would want to check my file to be absolutely </P>
<P>correct on it. I assume it would have been as a matter of </P>
<P>procedure. I don't think those compromises have to be passed on </P>
<P>back here in Washington. But I can't be sure of that and my </P>
<P>file would show the facts.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you make any visit to the Bureau of Internal </P>
<P>Revenue in connection with the Dr. Lee tax case other than your </P>
<P>original visit with Mr. Duke and Dr. Lee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't recall one, but it would have been </P>
<P>proper to do so.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. When did you see Mr. Reddish first?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The first time Dr. Lee was here. We talked to </P>
<P>the bureau.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Didn't you say this morning you couldn't recall </P>
<P>with whom you conferred?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. You mean by name?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't recall I said I could not recall with </P>
<P>whom I conferred. If I did say it, I do recall.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I was quite sure that the record will show that I </P>
<P>asked you specifically with whom you conferred in each </P>
<P>division, first in technical and then the collector's office, </P>
<P>and your answer was you could not recall. As a matter of fact, </P>
<P>I think you were asked by one of the members of the committee </P>
<P>who the collector was then, and you didn't recall.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. On the collector, I certainly don't recall.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Let me finish the question, please.</P>
<P>    And then you commented in any event, you didn't talk to the </P>
<P>collector, it was probably one of the deputies you talked with, </P>
<P>and you could not recall the name. I am quite sure the record </P>
<P>will indicate that you specifically stated you did not recall </P>
<P>the names of the persons with whom you conferred in the </P>
<P>technical section or the collector's office.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. If that is the testimony, it is certainly </P>
<P>subject to correction.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Do you wish to correct that testimony?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I certainly do. In the case of Mr. Reddish, if </P>
<P>that is pertinent or material, as to who it might have been, I </P>
<P>might check my file and recall who the other individual was. As </P>
<P>I indicated to you, as I remember in this situation, we walked </P>
<P>over there cold on the situation to talk to them. There were </P>
<P>two logical places to discuss the case. One was the technical </P>
<P>staff for an early conference, and the other was the </P>
<P>collector's office.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Do you recall with whom you conferred at the </P>
<P>technical staff? Do you recall that this afternoon?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. With whom?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Mr. Reddish.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. He was in the technical staff?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is right.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Had you known him before the conference on that </P>
<P>date?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I might have.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You don't recall whether you did or did not?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I might tell you why I might have known him, </P>
<P>because we were both members of the Missouri Society.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You have no specific recollection?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Have you ever seen him since that date?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Personally I believe not. I don't think I have </P>
<P>ever seen him since that time.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. With whom did you confer in the collector's </P>
<P>office?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Now I don't know.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You are quite sure you don't recall?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is what I think your question related to </P>
<P>this morning. If it related to both of them, then I would have </P>
<P>to certainly amend my testimony to say Krag Reddish, because </P>
<P>that name I do know.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Your testimony now is that except for this one </P>
<P>personal conference to which you were accompanied by Mr. Duke </P>
<P>and the taxpayer, you never again went to the Bureau of </P>
<P>Internal Revenue in Washington in connection with the Dr. Lee </P>
<P>case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I have no recollection of it, but had I done </P>
<P>so, it would be perfectly normal and natural to do so. But I </P>
<P>have no recollection of ever having done so.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. The petition was filed out west. Was any further </P>
<P>action by the Bureau of Internal Revenue in Washington </P>
<P>necessary?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. In connection with the case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. As I say, I don't know whether a settlement of </P>
<P>that kind would have to be passed on by the bureau back in </P>
<P>Washington.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Do you know whether it was passed on by the </P>
<P>bureau in Washington in that particular case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Not without referring to my file.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. This is the case where the government claimed the </P>
<P>jeopardy assessment was for $100,000, and the settlement was </P>
<P>$6,000?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. It was over $100,000.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Can you give us the figure?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't remember the exact amount. There were a </P>
<P>lot of penalties, including fraud penalty of 50 percent.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Would you say $140,000 might be accurate?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. It could have been.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Now, following your meeting with the Bureau of </P>
<P>Internal Revenue in Washington before the case was finally </P>
<P>compromised, do you know whether or not Senator Morse contacted </P>
<P>the Bureau of Internal Revenue with reference to this case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. He may have. I have no recollection of his </P>
<P>having done so. He may very well have done so.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You have no recollection?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you ever discuss with Mr. Duke or he with you </P>
<P>the fact that Senator Morse was being asked to communicate with </P>
<P>the Bureau of Internal Revenue?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I have no recollection on the point. Perhaps </P>
<P>so. I do remember in the Lee case that after the case had been </P>
<P>compromised, he was extremely anxious to get the assessment </P>
<P>lifted. As you know, the settlement would be in the technical </P>
<P>staff, and the lifting of the assessment would be, I believe, </P>
<P>with the collector. After it was compromised, there was still </P>
<P>the problem of getting the jeopardy assessment lifted. I think </P>
<P>he was interested in that. I had no part in that, as I </P>
<P>remember.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Mr. Chairman, may I at this point identify and </P>
<P>place in the record a telegram that has been produced here </P>
<P>pursuant to subpoena. It is a telegram dated September 8, 1950. </P>
<P>It is addressed to Russell Duke, 4523 Northeast Alameda. It is </P>
<P>signed Wayne Morse, USS. If I may, I would read the first </P>
<P>sentence.</P>
<P>    Senator Dirksen. Has this been submitted for the record </P>
<P>before?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. This has not.</P>
<P>    Senator Dirksen. The telegram will be identified for the </P>
<P>record, and in its entirety will be inserted in the record, and </P>
<P>counsel is privileged to read from it.</P>
<P>    [The telegram referred to was marked as committee's Exhibit </P>
<P>No. 4, Edward P. Morgan, January 16, 1953, and is as follows:]</P>

<P>PRA232 Govt PD-SN Washington DC 8 425P 1950 September 8</P>
<P>Russell Duke, 4523 Northeast Alameda PTLD</P>

<P>Have been in touch with Internal Revenue with reference to Dr. Lee's </P>
<P>tax case and just today the case was sent in from the local office. I </P>
<P>hope to have a definite report for you on Monday concerning it. S 3357 </P>
<P>passed the House August 28 and is now on the Senate table awaiting </P>
<P>action on House amendments. S 3358 is on the Senate calendar.</P>

<P>Regards, Wayne Morse, USS</P>

<P>    Senator Dirksen. Has the witness seen this telegram?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. No, I don't think so.</P>
<P>    Senator Dirksen. I think he should, first of all, for </P>
<P>refreshment.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I have seen it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I might ask you first of all, does that telegram </P>
<P>refresh your recollection as to whether or not Senator Morse </P>
<P>did communicate with the Bureau of Internal Revenue in </P>
<P>connection with the Lee tax case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That telegram would not refresh my </P>
<P>recollection, certainly. Senator Morse may well have </P>
<P>communicated with the Bureau of Internal Revenue concerning the </P>
<P>lifting of the jeopardy assessment. If he did so, I certainly </P>
<P>did not ask him to do so.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Mr. Chairman, the sentence I wish to read into </P>
<P>the record----</P>
<P>    Senator Dirksen. I think it is well to read the entire </P>
<P>exhibit, including all the code items.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn [reading]:</P>

<P>PRA232 Govt Pd--SN Washington, D.C. 8 425P Russell Duke, 4523 </P>
<P>Northeast Alameda PTLD. Have been in touch with Internal </P>
<P>Revenue with reference to Dr. Lee's tax case and just today the </P>
<P>case was sent in from the local office. I hope to have a </P>
<P>definite report for you on Monday concerning it. S 3357 passed </P>

<P>action on House amendments. S 3358 is on the Senate Calendar. </P>
<P>Regards. Wayne Morse USS.</P>

<P>    And your testimony is, Mr. Morgan, that on hearing that, it </P>
<P>does not in any way refresh your recollection as to whether or </P>
<P>not Senator Morse was in touch with the BIR?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That telegram does not refresh my memory, no. </P>
<P>He may well have been. I just have no recollection on it. I do </P>
<P>recall the general situation, that Dr. Lee was anxious to have </P>
<P>the assessment lifted after this compromise.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Mr. Chairman, may I identify for the record a </P>
<P>document produced here pursuant to subpoena, dated August 29, </P>
<P>1950, on the stationery of R. W. Duke, Portland 13, Oregon, </P>
<P>addressed to ``Dear Ed,'' and may I display it to the witness?</P>
<P>    Senator Dirksen. It will be identified for the record at </P>
<P>this point.</P>
<P>    [The letter referred to was marked as committee's Exhibit </P>
<P>No. 5, Edward P. Morgan, January 16, 1953, and is as follows]:</P>

<P>                                                   August 29, 1950.</P>
<P>    Dear Ed: As per our telephone conversation I am sending you this </P>
<P>letter explaining the entire arrangement made between Dr. Lee, and </P>
<P>myself.</P>
<P>    I did give Dr. Lee, a letter agreeing that he was to pay you a </P>
<P>certain sum and that I would then pay you the difference out of my own </P>
<P>pocket, however after writing the agreement I pointed out to Dr. Lee, </P>
<P>that it was unfair as I did not profit from the deal under the </P>
<P>arrangements because my cost on his case amounted to better than the </P>
<P>amount he was paying me. The final agreement was that Dr. Lee, would </P>
<P>pay you the full four thousand dollars. I feel confident that Dr. Lee, </P>
<P>does and will keep his word. The only reason that you are not paid is </P>
<P>one, he has desperately tried to raise the money from various sources, </P>
<P>and due to the jeopardy assessment against him it is difficult for </P>
<P>people to conceive that he could pay them back. As you know Senator </P>
<P>Morse's office has taken the matter up and I in turn called Mr. Earle, </P>
<P>collector of Portland, and told him exactly what has taken place up </P>
<P>until now and he in turn promised that he would see about the release </P>
<P>and let me know Monday. I do know that Dr. Lee, will upon being </P>
<P>released will immediately send you the money. Ed, I do have faith in </P>
<P>the Dr. for various reasons which I will explain to you via phone. I </P>
<P>still have a report that the doctor wants me to furnish him and until I </P>
<P>render the report the case is not completed. So please bear with him </P>
<P>and I will try to force the release thru the local collector.</P>
<P>    As soon as the boy is better I will be in Washington, D.C. as there </P>
<P>is a lot of which I have to do as soon as I get there. I am getting </P>
<P>inquiries regarding representation for various type of representation </P>
<P>for firms here in the Northwest.</P>
<P>    With best personal regards, I remain,</P>
<P>            Sincerely.</P>

<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, I recognize this letter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You do recognize it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. This is one of the letters, I believe, that I </P>
<P>produced pursuant to your subpoena. Is that correct?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. We will check that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I would like the record to indicate that </P>
<P>certainly.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I said we will check that.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Fine.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You recognize that letter as a letter you </P>
<P>received from Mr. Duke, is that right?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I remember the letter, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. May I read the letter into the record?</P>
<P>    Senator Dirksen. Yes, in its entirety.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. May the record indicate that this letter was </P>
<P>produced by Mr. Morgan?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't wish to be over-technical, but I wish </P>
<P>you would indicate it is a carbon copy of the letter.</P>
<P>    Senator Dirksen. To make sure that the record is correct, </P>
<P>this letter was procured under subpoena, and is identified as </P>
<P>carbon copy, unsigned, but on stationery allegedly of R. W. </P>
<P>Duke, Portland 13, Oregon, and the letterhead, instead of </P>
<P>appearing at the top of the letter, appears on the left-hand </P>
<P>side.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. May I read the letter?</P>
<P>    Senator Dirksen. The letter may be read.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn [reading]:</P>

<P>    August 29th, 1950. Dear Ed: As per our telephone </P>
<P>conversation I am sending you this letter explaining the entire </P>
<P>arrangement made between Dr. Lee, and myself:</P>
<P>    I did give Dr. Lee a letter agreeing that he was to pay you </P>
<P>a certain sum and that I would then pay you the difference out </P>
<P>of my own pocket, however after writing the agreement I pointed </P>
<P>out to Dr. Lee that it was unfair as I did not profit from the </P>
<P>deal under the arrangements because my cost on his case </P>
<P>amounted to better than the amount he was paying me. The final </P>
<P>agreement was that Dr. Lee would pay you the full four thousand </P>
<P>dollars. I feel confident that Dr. Lee does and will keep his </P>
<P>word. The only reason that you are not paid is one, he has </P>
<P>desperately tried to raise the money from various sources, and </P>
<P>due to the jeopardy assessment against him it is difficult for </P>
<P>people to conceive that he could pay them back. As you know </P>
<P>Senator Morse's office has taken the matter up and I in turn </P>
<P>called Mr. Earle, collector of Portland, and told him exactly </P>
<P>what has taken place up until now and he in turn promised that </P>
<P>he would see about the release and let me know Monday. I do </P>
<P>know that Dr. Lee will upon being released will immediately </P>
<P>send you the money. Ed, I do have faith in the doctor for </P>
<P>various reasons which I will explain to you via phone. I still </P>
<P>have a report that the doctor wants me to furnish him and until </P>
<P>I render the report the case is not completed. So please bear </P>
<P>with him and I will try to force the release through the local </P>
<P>collector.</P>
<P>    As soon as the boy is better I will be in Washington, D.C., </P>
<P>as there is a lot of work which I have to do as soon as I get </P>
<P>there. I am getting inquiries regarding representation for </P>
<P>various types of representation for firms here in the </P>
<P>Northwest.</P>
<P>    With best personal regards, I remain, Sincerely.</P>

<P>    This copy is unsigned.</P>
<P>    Now, does this letter refresh your recollection as to </P>
<P>whether or not Senator Morse was in touch with the BIR?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. It does not refresh my recollection. I had no </P>
<P>knowledge--personal knowledge--that Senator Morse had been in </P>
<P>touch with the BIR. The letter here that Duke has, a copy of </P>
<P>which I produced for this committee, indicates that that is the </P>
<P>case.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And that you were so advised?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Beg pardon?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And that you were so advised.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. It says, ``As you know,'' meaning as I would </P>
<P>know.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Meaning as you, Mr. Morgan, would know, that </P>
<P>Senator Morse has been in touch, and so on.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I have no recollection of Senator Morse having </P>
<P>done so. He may have done so. I assume it would be perfectly </P>
<P>proper for him to do so, but I have no independent recollection </P>
<P>on the matter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you know that Mr. Duke was to be compensated </P>
<P>in connection with the Lee tax case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The sequence of events on that, if I may be </P>
<P>permitted to explain it, were these. Dr. Lee and Mr. Duke came </P>
<P>to my office. I had no real thought, necessarily, at that </P>
<P>juncture of formally representing Mr. Lee. I was merely trying </P>
<P>to help in connection with these two little visits over at the </P>
<P>BIR and no suggestion was made of a possible fee at that point. </P>
<P>When we got back to my office, and Dr. Lee realized that there </P>
<P>was no possibility of getting a jeopardy assessment lifted, and </P>
<P>it was explained to him what was involved insofar as legal </P>
<P>steps were concerned, he asked me if I would undertake to </P>
<P>represent him in connection with the case, and I told him that </P>
<P>I would. The fee decided upon was $4,000 in a contingent fee </P>
<P>arrangement. The contingency, as earlier indicated, was lifting </P>
<P>the assessment so he could pay the fee. After the case was </P>
<P>finally disposed of, I communicated with Dr. Lee, as I </P>
<P>remember, for my fee, and at that particular point to the </P>
<P>matter Dr. Lee pointed out that I would have to look to Mr. </P>
<P>Duke for my money. At that point I think I probably called Duke </P>
<P>and I think I was probably incensed at the time. I think this </P>
<P>letter that you have read is his reply to that.</P>
<P>    Now, Dr. Lee wrote me a letter, which I have, after he </P>
<P>appeared before the King committee in San Francisco. I </P>
<P>appreciated it. The letter said, ``Since you were my attorney </P>
<P>in this case, I felt I should tell you my testimony before the </P>
<P>King committee.'' In his letter he indicates his recollection </P>
<P>that I knew at the time of the original visit about his </P>
<P>arrangement with Russell Duke. The doctor is honestly mistaken </P>
<P>concerning the matter. But, gentlemen, for your purposes, if a </P>
<P>man came to my office, being legitimate, as I thought he was, </P>
<P>and being the agent of Dr. Lee, as I thought he was, I would be </P>
<P>willing to concede the point. But I think the correspondence </P>
<P>will indicate my knowledge on the matter was after the original </P>
<P>meeting. I just feel that it would be ridiculous for me to </P>
<P>undertake to go to the West Coast and handle a case for $4,000 </P>
<P>on a contingent basis had I known that this fellow had received </P>
<P>eight or nine thousand dollars in the matter. It just does not </P>
<P>make any sense to me. I think that the whole sequence of events </P>
<P>bear that out. But I would concede the point. So what? I </P>
<P>thought he was a bona fide agent of the doctor. It was one of </P>
<P>the first matters he ever came to the office with.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Now, I think you told us you had no financial </P>
<P>transactions with Mr. Duke, except for the $500 loan you made </P>
<P>to him, is that right?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The $500 loan was made out of our firm account, </P>
<P>yes, with the approval of my partners.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. That appears on the books of your firm?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I think I gave you the original entry at the </P>
<P>time I produced the papers pursuant to your subpoena.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And with that exception you have had no financial </P>
<P>transactions with Mr. Duke, is that right?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. To the best of my knowledge and belief, I have </P>
<P>not.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you ever split any fee with Mr. Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That I can state categorically no.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you ever have any discussion with Mr. Duke </P>
<P>concerning the possibility of splitting a fee with him?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No. On that score I desire to be very positive </P>
<P>because I naturally assumed that you are building up to </P>
<P>something of this kind in your interrogation. In the entire </P>
<P>relationship that I might have had with Russell Duke certain </P>
<P>things were definitely and clearly understood. Number one, that </P>
<P>my relationship was always directly with the client or with the </P>
<P>client's lawyer. Additionally, that as a lawyer the ethics of </P>
<P>my profession precluded the splitting of fees, and I am now </P>
<P>stating to you categorically that I never split any fee at any </P>
<P>time with Russell W. Duke.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. And that you never had any discussion about the </P>
<P>possibility of splitting one?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Russell Duke at one time may or may not have </P>
<P>indicated an interest in having something from some of these </P>
<P>cases, but I am telling you that in any relationship that point </P>
<P>was, certainly made very clear. I have never--I don't need to </P>
<P>make a self-serving statement like that--in my profession split </P>
<P>a fee. Certainly not.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You say he might have suggested it one time. Do </P>
<P>you specifically recall it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No, I don't. I do recall having made certain </P>
<P>things clear to him, and I assume that the only reason I would </P>
<P>have done that is by reason of his inferring or implying that, </P>
<P>I don't know.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you have any connection with Mr. Duke </P>
<P>concerning any claims case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. It is possible. There are in my mind one, two </P>
<P>or three situations. This fellow was calling me all the time. </P>
<P>Check your telephone logs, gentlemen. He would call me morning, </P>
<P>noon and night. I was not so sophisticated in the practice or </P>
<P>so busy that I did not listen to him. I did. He was one of </P>
<P>those individuals who had a thousand things on the fire. If </P>
<P>there are any particular ones you want to ask me about, I will </P>
<P>try to remember.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. You are saying you don't offhand recall any?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Offhand, I don't.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. How about the claims cases involving Herman </P>
<P>Lawson and Company and James A. Nelson?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. The Herman Lawson situation, if I remember it </P>
<P>correctly, that is something that Duke discussed with me about </P>
<P>a bill, I think. This is subject to correction. I think the </P>
<P>relief bill in the case had been introduced in the House and </P>
<P>Senate before I met the fellow. That is subject to correction. </P>
<P>I just don't remember. I do know that he had said that he </P>
<P>represented these people. I think they were California people, </P>
<P>as I remember, who built a post office or something down there, </P>
<P>and by reason of some difficulties in connection with the </P>
<P>contract, they were entitled to some type of relief in the </P>
<P>opinion of those that were making the claim. They apparently </P>
<P>had engaged Mr. Duke to prosecute their claim on their behalf </P>
<P>and to represent them in that connection, and I think a bill </P>
<P>had been introduced for such relief. I recall his discussing </P>
<P>that with me, yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. By whom had it been introduced?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. As I remember, I think Senator Morse introduced </P>
<P>the bill. I think that antedated or predated my acquaintance </P>
<P>with Duke. I can't be sure. I know I had nothing to do with any </P>
<P>conversations prior to the introduction of the bill.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Now, how about the James A. Nelson claim case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That does not strike a bell in my mind. It may </P>
<P>be a part and parcel of the Lawson case, I don't know. It just </P>
<P>doesn't strike any bell at all.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. With reference to the Lawson case, was there </P>
<P>ever any discussion between Mr. Duke and yourself concerning a </P>
<P>fee to compensate for both of them?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. No, I know exactly the story on that particular </P>
<P>case, because I had really little or nothing to do with it </P>
<P>until late in September of 1950, as I remember, and that is </P>
<P>subject to correction. Duke called one time from the West Coast </P>
<P>and said he was flat broke and could not come back here to </P>
<P>confer on it. He said he had been talking, I think, to Senator </P>
<P>Morse's administrative assistant about the matter, and he was </P>
<P>hoping at that time to get the matter revived, because he felt </P>
<P>that there was merit in the case. I think he wrote a letter, </P>
<P>possibly in connection with it. I can't be specific about that. </P>
<P>He asked me to run a check on it. I made one check in </P>
<P>connection with the case, and I think I wrote him a letter, and </P>
<P>that is as far as I remember any specifics on the matter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Did you produce that letter here for us that you </P>
<P>wrote?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I don't know. I don't have the copies of the </P>
<P>correspondence that I made available to you.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Mr. Chairman, may I identify for the record a </P>
<P>letter dated September 8, 1950, on the same stationery of R. W. </P>
<P>Duke, Portland 13, Oregon, with the name and address printed in </P>
<P>the margin, addressed to Mr. Edward P. Morgan, Welch, Mott &amp; </P>
<P>Morgan, Erickson Building, Washington, D.C., and signed with </P>
<P>the signature that purports to be Russell W. Duke.</P>
<P>    Having identified that, may I display it to the witness?</P>
<P>    Senator Dirksen. It may be so done. May I say that this </P>
<P>letter at this point will appear in its entirety in the record.</P>
<P>    [The letter referred to was marked as committee's Exhibit </P>
<P>No. 6, Edward P. Morgan, January 16, 1953, and is as follows:]</P>

<P>                                                 September 8, 1950.</P>
<P>Mr. Edward P. Morgan,</P>
<P>Welch, Mott &amp; Morgan, Erickson Building,</P>
<P>710 Fourteenth Northwest, Washington, DC.</P>
<P>    Dear Ed: Attached is a letter which I received from Herman Lawson </P>
<P>and Company. It is self-explanatory. Unquestionably, other claimants </P>
<P>have sent me letters addressed to the Continental hotel giving me like </P>
<P>authorization.</P>
<P>    As you know I have worked on this case for over 3 years and up to </P>
<P>date I have received approximately $4,000 from Herman Lawson &amp; Company </P>
<P>and $500 or $1000 from James A. Nelson. The total of the claim due me </P>
<P>would be $18,000. The majority of moneys which I have received, in fact </P>
<P>all the moneys which I have received, has been used in travel and </P>
<P>expense pushing this bill through.</P>
<P>    If you care to file this case under the Tucker Act, attached you </P>
<P>will find that portion of the Tucker Act under which this case can be </P>
<P>won.</P>
<P>    I am due to arrive in Washington some time next week at which time </P>
<P>I sincerely hope you will be in Washington so that we can get together </P>
<P>on this and other matters. Regarding the balance of the fee due on this </P>
<P>particular claims case, I am sure that whatever you decide on the fee </P>
<P>will be satisfactory to me. I have been given assurance that under this </P>
<P>Tucker Act we can definitely win the case.</P>
<P>    Did Doctor Lee send you the total of $4,000? If not, please let me </P>
<P>know immediately as I will see that you get every dime of it. As I had </P>
<P>stated in my previous letter to you this case is not finished until Dr. </P>
<P>Lee gets a report.</P>
<P>    With best respects, I remain,</P>
<P>            Sincerely,</P>
<P>                                                         R.W. Duke.</P>
<P>    P.S., Have you heard from the Johnson Committee? If you haven't, I </P>
<P>am sure you will.</P>

<P>    Mr. Morgan. May I make an inquiry as to whether this is one </P>
<P>of the letters I produced pursuant to your subpoena?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Yes.</P>
<P>    Senator Dirksen. Let the record show that this letter was </P>
<P>produced under subpoena.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I might state for the record, Mr. Chairman, if I </P>
<P>may, that this is a photostat of the original.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, sir, I have read it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Would you read that letter for the record?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes. It is dated September 8, 1950, addressed </P>
<P>to Mr. Edward P. Morgan, Welch, Mott &amp; Morgan, Erickson </P>
<P>Building, 710 Fourteenth N.W., Washington, D.C. [reading]:</P>

<P>    Dear Ed: Attached is a letter which I received from Herman </P>
<P>Lawson and Company. It is self-explanatory.</P>
<P>    Unquestionably other claimants have sent me letters </P>
<P>addressed to the Continental hotel giving me like </P>
<P>authorization.</P>
<P>    As you know I have worked on this case for over 3 years and </P>
<P>up to date I have received approximately $4,000 from Herman </P>
<P>Lawson &amp; Company and $500 or $1000 from James A. Nelson. The </P>
<P>total of the claim due me would be $18,000. The majority of </P>
<P>moneys which I have received, in fact all the moneys which I </P>
<P>have received, has been used in travel and expense pushing this </P>
<P>bill through.</P>
<P>    If you care to file this case under the Tucker Act, </P>
<P>attached you will find that portion of the Tucker Act under </P>
<P>which this case can be won.</P>
<P>    I am due to arrive in Washington some time next week at </P>
<P>which time I sincerely hope you will be in Washington so that </P>
<P>we can get together on this and other matters. Regarding the </P>
<P>balance of the fee due on this particular claims case, I am </P>
<P>sure that whatever you decide on the fee will be satisfactory </P>
<P>to me. I have been given assurance that under this Tucker Act </P>
<P>we can definitely win the case.</P>
<P>    Did Doctor Lee send you the total of $4,000? If not, please </P>
<P>let me know immediately as I will see that you get every dime </P>
<P>of it. As I had stated in my previous letter to you this case </P>
<P>is not finished until Dr. Lee gets a report.</P>
<P>    With best respects, I remain, Sincerely, R.W. Duke.</P>

<P>    It has a P.S., ``Have you heard from the Johnson Committee? </P>
<P>If you haven't, I am sure you will.''</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. With reference to the sentence, ``Regarding the </P>
<P>balance of the fee due on this particular claims case, I am </P>
<P>sure that whatever you decide on the fee will be satisfactory </P>
<P>to me,'' what was Mr. Duke's interest in the fee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. In this particular case?</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. This is just about the substance of the case </P>
<P>insofar as I know, and the correspondence which was attached to </P>
<P>it, which I would assume was returned to him.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Pardon me?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I would assume any correspondence attached here </P>
<P>was returned to him.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What interest did Mr. Duke have in a possible fee </P>
<P>in this case? It says, ``I am sure whatever you decide on the </P>
<P>fee will be satisfactory to me.''</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. He is presenting a situation here in which he </P>
<P>had an arrangement with the Herman Lawson Company going back </P>
<P>three years, and he is presenting it to me at this late date </P>
<P>for consideration. In other words, he is saying to me at that </P>
<P>point whatever fee you care to set for your services would be </P>
<P>satisfactory.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. To Duke?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What concern was it of Duke's?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Insofar as his representation of these people </P>
<P>might be concerned, if he was formally the agent of these </P>
<P>people, and formally represented them and there were a fee </P>
<P>forthcoming--the point is I never claimed any fee in this </P>
<P>latter.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Doesn't this envision the possibility that there </P>
<P>will be a fee which must be satisfactory to both you and Mr. </P>
<P>Duke, and I would assume from that a fee in which both you and </P>
<P>Mr. Duke would participate?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I am sure if I undertook to represent the </P>
<P>Herman Lawson Company in any extended matter apart from a </P>
<P>simple inquiry which I make every day for friends all over the </P>
<P>country, with no thought of remuneration, if I do so, I would </P>
<P>want a fee arrangement. I am in the law practice and I am not </P>
<P>in it for my health. This is Duke's letter. This is not my </P>
<P>letter concerning the matter. You are asking me what I might </P>
<P>construe from what Mr. Duke might say. I am telling you that </P>
<P>upon the formal undertaking of representation of Herman Lawson </P>
<P>Company in a matter of this kind, I would want a fee </P>
<P>arrangement with the Herman Lawson Company certainly.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Doesn't this one sentence, ``I am sure whatever </P>
<P>you decide on the fee will be satisfactory to me'' refresh your </P>
<P>recollection to the point that there was at least one instance </P>
<P>in which Mr. Duke was interested in splitting a fee?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Mr. Duke may have been interested, counsel, in </P>
<P>splitting the fee.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. That is my question.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. It doesn't mean that to me necessarily.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. It does not mean that?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is right. If I were to take some of the </P>
<P>things that Mr. Duke might have in his letters and presume to </P>
<P>have to pass judgment on everything he might say about what he </P>
<P>intended in contemplation of what I might consider in the </P>
<P>matter, that would be rather ridiculous and I couldn't do it. </P>
<P>What this letter means to me is simply this, that he has a case </P>
<P>that he got back in 1948 before I ever knew the gentleman, and </P>
<P>he is at this late date trying to see if something can be done </P>
<P>about it, and he is asking my opinion about it, and he is </P>
<P>saying in effect whatever fee in the situation would appeal to </P>
<P>you would be satisfactory to me. But that has nothing to do </P>
<P>with me, gentlemen.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Mr. Chairman, may I ask one question </P>
<P>that I am not quite clear about? Is that the case in which he </P>
<P>had received approximately $4,000 up to date, which he claimed </P>
<P>had been consumed in expenditures?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. And that he had anticipated an </P>
<P>arrangement for a fee of about $18,000?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, that is right.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Hearing it read, it carries with it the </P>
<P>implication possibly that you were to charge him a fee out of </P>
<P>his $18,000. Was there any consideration in that regard, that </P>
<P>you were to get your fee from him, since he was their agent, </P>
<P>and already had a contract with them?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I would certainly agree with you.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. I am just asking. I do not know.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. On that point. I mean from his letter you might </P>
<P>make such a connotation and such a construction. The </P>
<P>significant point is this, that I never represented the Herman </P>
<P>Lawson Company in contemplation of formal legal representation. </P>
<P>He had called me, as I remember, prior to this letter and said </P>
<P>that he was broke, couldn't get back here, and that he had </P>
<P>phoned, I think, Senator Morse's administrative assistant, as I </P>
<P>remember, because my memory was refreshed in connection with </P>
<P>that. I looked it over, I decided in my own mind it was a dead </P>
<P>duck and to make a long story short, I never represented the </P>
<P>Herman Lawson Company. So insofar as any fee arrangement might </P>
<P>be concerned insofar as I might be concerned, there was no fee </P>
<P>arrangement.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. It seems here he had a contract with </P>
<P>them as their representative.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, sir.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Whereby he expected to earn a total of </P>
<P>$18,000.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. If the agreement was carried out between </P>
<P>him and those clients that he was representing. Now, there </P>
<P>might be some other explanation of this, but on the face of it, </P>
<P>it indicates to me if you had had no contact with the clients </P>
<P>direct prior to that time, that he may have been paying to you </P>
<P>out of this $18,000, whatever fee you fix would be agreeable to </P>
<P>him. I do not know that that is true. I am asking you, since </P>
<P>you were one of the parties to it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I wish I could shed more light on it. But let </P>
<P>us put it this way. Duke had a contract with the Herman Lawson </P>
<P>Company before I ever knew him. In other words, I had not </P>
<P>participated in the negotiation of any such contract. Let us </P>
<P>assume that he is a legitimate agent of the Lawson Company, and </P>
<P>I suppose we must certainly concede that. If as an agent of the </P>
<P>Lawson Company he should pay me a fee in connection with legal </P>
<P>work that I might do, I would say that was certainly ethically </P>
<P>proper.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. I would, too. The further point is he is </P>
<P>saying here, I have a contingent fee of $18,000. I assume that </P>
<P>is what he means, if the claim is prosecuted successfully.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is what he is saying.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. And anything you want to charge me out </P>
<P>of that for your services would be agreeable to me. I do not </P>
<P>know that those are the facts, but it appears that way on the </P>
<P>surface to me.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I would say that is a fair construction from </P>
<P>Mr. Duke's letter.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Let me ask one further thing there in </P>
<P>that connection to clarify it further. Did you ever represent </P>
<P>this client-what is his name--Herman Lawson? After receipt of </P>
<P>this letter, or had you prior to that been in direct touch with </P>
<P>the Lawson Company?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. To the best of my knowledge and belief I have </P>
<P>not.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Did you ever afterwards contact them or </P>
<P>did they contact you with reference to this matter directly?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. To the best of my knowledge and belief I did </P>
<P>not.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Then you never accepted employment </P>
<P>either from Duke or from Lawson?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. To the best of my knowledge and belief I did </P>
<P>not.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. You did not accept employment?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Correct. I did not accept employment certainly </P>
<P>to the best of my knowledge and belief. I made an inquiry </P>
<P>concerning the case as a favor to Duke, that was all.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Then you rejected the employment in the </P>
<P>case after that inquiry?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I think I advised them that the case had no </P>
<P>merit as I remember. At any rate, I did not pursue it.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. You did not pursue it.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is right.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. You never earned anything out of it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Not a penny.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. You never had any direct contact with </P>
<P>the client?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That is correct.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. In any way whatsoever?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. To the best of my knowledge and belief I am </P>
<P>quite sure I did not earn anything in connection with it.</P>
<P>    Senator McClellan. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Now, I would like to direct your attention to the </P>
<P>case involving Jack Glass.</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. I believe you told us about that this morning. </P>
<P>Exactly how did that case come to your attention?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That case to the best of my knowledge and </P>
<P>belief was referred to me directly by Maurice Hendon.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. He is the Los Angeles lawyer?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. That was my impression. It has been my </P>
<P>impression all along, and within the past two months, I was in </P>
<P>Los Angeles, California, talking to Mr. Hendon, and this </P>
<P>question came up and he said, ``By the way, did you have any </P>
<P>connection with this fellow Duke'' or did I, in connection with </P>
<P>this Glass case. ``Just how did you happen to get in touch with </P>
<P>me in connection with the case?'' He related the circumstances </P>
<P>and he told me about the King committee having been in touch </P>
<P>with him concerning the matter, and that he had referred the </P>
<P>case to me on the basis of some friend of mine who had </P>
<P>suggested that he get in touch with me. My memory is as vague </P>
<P>on it as can be, just as vague as can be. If Russell Duke </P>
<P>himself directly referred the case to me, I would admit it. I </P>
<P>have no reluctance about doing that. As I say, I thought this </P>
<P>man was legitimate. I was grateful to him. I handled everything </P>
<P>that he referred to me strictly on the merits. I think if you </P>
<P>will look at the files you will find that I worked my cases, </P>
<P>every one of them. So in answering your question here, as I </P>
<P>have, saying it is vague, I don't do so to circumvent any </P>
<P>admissions with respect to that. If Russell Duke had put Mr. </P>
<P>Glass in touch with me, I would have represented him if I </P>
<P>thought it was a legitimate situation.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. What happened in the Glass case? Did you actually </P>
<P>come into it?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes. Mr. Hendon came back and he and I </P>
<P>conferred at the Department of Justice. I submitted a rather </P>
<P>extensive brief, which the file will reflect, as far as the </P>
<P>facts would permit in connection with the case.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. With whom did you confer at the Department of </P>
<P>Justice?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. I think it was Col. Swearingen, as I stated </P>
<P>this morning.</P>
<P>    Mr. Cohn. Then Mr. Glass is the gentleman who later passed </P>
<P>on, due to a heart condition, is that correct?</P>
<P>    Mr. Morgan. Yes, he died not long after the case was </P>
<P>finally disposed of. I might say that in this case the </P>
<P>Department of Justice did not decline prosecution. The </P>
<P>Department of Justice referred the case to the United States </P>
<P>attorney and asked on the basis of the man's physical and </P>
<P>mental condition whether the United States attorney wanted to </P>
<P>prosecute. Mr. </P>
