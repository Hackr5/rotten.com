<blockquote><tt>
An evil association teaching a doctrine of hate, and addressing itself to the task of generating bigotry and strife, has no place in America and should not be permitted to exist. If this were the message and mission of the Klan, it should be destroyed. And every true Klansman, who is a real Christian patriot, would aid in its destruction. But the mission of the Klan is harmony, and the mission of the Klan is love.  
</tt></blockquote>

Once upon a time, the Ku Klux Klan had a wonderful PR image. Difficult as it may be to imagine, in the 1920s the Klan was widely regarded as a benevolent public service organization. At least among white Americans.
<p>

And why not? How could you not love an organization whose chapter president is called The Exalted Cyclops? It's so <i>adorable</i>. Plus, there's their affectation of the abusing the letter K. If you read the 1965 <i>Kloran</i> of the Mississippi branch, you are treated to such terms as

<tt>
kharacter,
klavern,
klongress,
klonklave,
klonversation,
klonvocation,
</tt>
and 
<tt>
kreed.
</tt>

They even refer to dates by the year of the group's inception, which was 1866. Thus, the year 2000 was 134 AK (Anno Klan). You have to admit: that is just <i>precious</i>.

It's like a secret club for kids. Well, white kids anyway.
<p>

It is widely-believed but poorly documented that one of the original founders of the KKK was a Confederate general (plus an influential and prominent <a href="/library/conspiracy/freemasonry/">Freemason</a>) named Albert Pike.
