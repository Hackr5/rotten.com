<h1>Eagle Scouts</h1>

<img src="/library/culture/eagle-scouts/eagle_scout_patch_1970s.jpg" height="240" width="190" align=left hspace=15>

Among America's pantheon of sacrosanct icons is that of the Eagle Scout --  incorruptible defender of honor and virtue. The Eagle Scout is the youthful guardian of our most basic values and traditions. He is simultaneously the epitome of both the dorky patriot as well as idealistic overachiever. He is America's future, destined for great things: military careerist, <a href="/library/conspiracy/cia/">CIA</a> asset, elected officeholder, captain of industry.
<p>

To maintain this Norman Rockwell image in the public mind, the Boy Scouts of America is constantly hyping the astronauts and other successful types who once earned the Eagle Scout rank. Understandably, they don't like to talk about Eagles who went wrong: the pedophiles, murderers, corporate crooks, etc. They sweep the bad apples under the rug, and pretend that they were never Boy Scouts at all. 
<p>

Ironically, it is precisely this policy of quiet "unpersoning" that fosters tall tales about notorious fallen Eagles, like <a href="/library/bio/crime/serial-killers/charles-manson/">Charles Manson</a>, <a href="/library/bio/misc/g-gordon-liddy/">G. Gordon Liddy</a>, <a href="/library/bio/usa/oliver-north/">Oliver North</a>, and <a href="/library/bio/business/bill-gates/">Bill Gates</a>. None of these men were actually Eagles (although Gates <i>almost</i> made it -- gave up sometime after earning the rank of Life Scout). These rumors won't cease as long as the BSA just pretends to ignore the whole controversy.
