<h1>American Francophobia</h1>

<p>

For the past sixty years, <a href="/library/history/countries/france/">France</a> has been a mainstay of American xenophobia. Since <a href="/library/history/war/wwii/">World War II</a>, their citizens have been the butt of foreigner jokes for three generations of Americans. It all boils down to a deep-seated suspicion that, for whatever reason, the crepe-eaters just plain never fought hard enough against the <a href="/library/history/nazi/">Germans</a>.
<p>

America stereotypes the people of France as rude, effete bastards having an undeserved air of self-importance and a culture based primarily around their cuisine. They are generally dismissed as pretentious egomaniacs, with a propensity toward an undeserved ethnocentrism.
<p>

These prejudices against the French are so engrained in American culture that isolated instances go unchallenged by typical citizens. In fact, they're barely even noticed at all -- fading into the background. Since they were young, Americans have become desensitized to anti-French portrayals in the media and overall culture.
<p>

So, naturally, when France began making noises that they would veto a United Nations resolution authorizing America to stomp <a href="/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam</a> flat, the response back in the US of A was fairly predictable.
<p>

French wine flowed in the streets, the various gutter bordeaux and beaujolais, never mind that the French still received payment for such spilt protest. And Fox News pundit <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/pundits/bill-oreilly/">Bill O'Reilly</a> called for a consumer boycott of French goods.
<p>

Florida Congresswoman Ginny Brown-Waite sponsored House Resolution 1265: the American Hero's Repatriation Act of 2003. "France has consistently turned its back on the United States... They forget, if it weren't for America, they would be speaking German today."
