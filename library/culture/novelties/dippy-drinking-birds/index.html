<h1>Dippy 
  Drinking Birds</h1>
<p>The Edmund Scientific company has been selling engineering, robotic, and astronomy 
  supplies since 1942 -- but their stand out best seller and unofficial mascot 
  is the <b>Dippy Drinking Bird.</b> Dippy reached new heights of popularity in 
  1995, during an episode of <i><a href="/library/culture/the-simpsons/">The Simpsons</a></i> in which a 300-pound Homer sets Dippy 
  in front of his keyboard to automate the monitoring of the Springfield nuclear 
  plant. </p>
<p>In 1946, thermodynamics engineer and chemical hobbyist Miles V. Sullivan filed 
  a technical illustration with the U.S. Patent Office for his version of a bird-shaped 
  Heat Engine. The structure of the bird was comprised of two glass bulbs: one 
  for the head (and beak, and jaunty hat, and googly eyeballs) and another for 
  the lower body (and shakeable tail feathers).</p>
<p><img src="mediumbird.jpg" width="200" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Originally 
  Dippy was clamped along the side of a water glass, but the balancing mechanism 
  would later evolve into tall, stork-like legs upon which the glass bulbs were 
  balanced and perched. Variations included duck shapes and giraffes, but the 
  essential mechanics of the device remained constant. <img src="drinking_girafe.jpg" width="144" height="259" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">A 
  thin glass tube connecting the two bulbs from the inside extended down into 
  the lower body, where it dipped into a reservoir of Freon-based liquid (now 
  banned) or colored methylene chloride. This is the fluid that rises and falls 
  to make Dippy bobble back and forth.</p>
<p>Most of the air is vacuum-sucked from the glass structure at the factory, after 
  the liquid is placed inside. Although the head and upper part of the glass tube 
  appear to be "empty", they are actually full of active, vaporous gas 
  from the methylene chloride, which doesn't take much heat energy to turn from 
  a vapor into a liquid, or vice versa. In the scientific community, that's 
  called a "low latent heat of evaporation".</p>
<p>Methylene chloride, also called dichloromethane (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>), 
  is a volatile, colorless liquid with a chloroform-like odor. It's used in various 
  industrial processes in many different industries -- including paint stripping, 
  pharmaceutical manufacturing, paint remover manufacturing, metal cleaning and 
  degreasing, and so forth. The most common means of exposure to methylene chloride 
  is inhalation or skin exposure, i.e. your son or daughter smashes Dippy against 
  the windowsill and drinks the holiday fruit punch inside. OSHA considers methylene 
  chloride to be a potential occupational carcinogen: in studies, mice exposed 
  to airborne methylene chloride developed cancers and tumors of the lung and 
  the liver. </p>
<p><img src="bird_amin.gif" width="244" height="247" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Anyway, 
  if the head bulb is slightly cooler than the body bulb, a temperature differential 
  occurs. The methylene chloride turns from a liquid to a vapor, and as it rises 
  up the glass tube, vacuum action pulls the liquid up along with it, like a thermometer. 
  When it nears the top, Dippy's head tips forward on the swing-leg hinges, dunks 
  his nose into a glass of water and appears to drink. While the whole family 
  sits around applauding and taking pictures, Dippy's red felt-covered beak, face, 
  and head are absorbing water from the drinking glass. As the moisture evaporates 
  from the fabric, the head becomes cooler than the body and internal pressures 
  within the chamber are equalized.</p>
<p>The vapor turns back into liquid, the liquid drops to the lower bulb, and Dippy's 
  center of gravity pivots him to his normal, natural, upright position. Under 
  the right conditions, Dippy can tipple and topple back and forth quickly, dook-dook-dooking 
  like there's no tomorrow. But don't try to be clever in front of your stupid 
  friends and put alcohol-based beverages in Dippy's shotglass: the swinging pendulum 
  motion of the body can accelerate the chaos of the liquid and vapor, and the 
  evaporation process from Dippy's head requires liquid no heavier than water. 
  You can, however, "trick" Dippy into drinking by positioning a lamp 
  toward the bottom bulb. If you limit the penumbra (falloff) from the light so 
  Dippy's head remains cool, he'll go back and forth and even drink without a 
  water glass for hours at a time. But exercise caution: <img src="dbd.jpg" width="445" height="353" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">lamplight 
  can produce excessive heat, and Dippy's glass will burst. One Dippy Bird hack 
  involves painting the body black so the body becomes warmer more quickly than 
  the head.</p>
<p>In 1966, civil engineer and logistics expert R.B. Murrow developed an abstract 
  study recommending that the possibilities of a Dippy Drinking Bird heat engine 
  be investigated to see if it could be further developed into a useful machine 
  which performed low-power requirement tasks in primitive environments (such 
  as the one addressing the Egyptian low-water-lift agricultural problem). In 
  the report, such an engine was described in considerable detail. Direct experiment 
  has shown that the Dippy Drinking Bird works best on small scale, and does so 
  particularly well under the arid climatological conditions of Egypt and many 
  other underdeveloped countries. By measuring the power output of a drinking 
  bird, attaching it to a windglass and using it to lift heavy paper clips, scientist 
  Don Rathjen reported the successful extraction of a nanohorsepower of work (about 
  a microwatt).</p>
<p>Artist Daniel Reynolds spent six years and $20,000 developing his most brilliant 
  work to date: a flock of fifteen enormous drinking birds filling an entire art 
  gallery. Each is six and a half feet tall, and 3,000 times heavier than the 
  original Dippy. The <img src="exhibition1.jpg" width="510" height="284" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">birds 
  are made of pyrex glass, and require a special vacuum attachment so the liquid 
  can travel efficiently. The head of the Institute of Thermodynamics at the University 
  of Stuttgart in Germany turned over all their research and development resources 
  to assist in the project.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the art and science of Dippy the Drinking Bird were only the 
  precursor to cheaper, gimmicky Hand Boiler devices also known as "libido 
  detectors" -- the looped and twisted glass sculptures containing a liquid 
  which bubbles and churns like a tempest in a teacup with the heat from your 
  bare hand. Once the bulbous end is out of your hands, it takes a few moments 
  for the liquid to cool down. No delightful bird shape, no pointy beak, no pretty 
  eyes or feathers -- just another example of the dumbing down and over-pussification 
  of America's youth. You can probably find Hand Boilers at the Hallmark store 
  near the candles and cat calendars. Dippy Drinking Birds, while hardly extinct, 
  are now primarily indigenous to magic shops.</p>
