<h1>Jerkcity</h1>

<p><img src="/library/culture/jerkcity/jerkcity1585.gif" height="289" width="289" hspace="15" vspace="15" align="left"> <b>Jerkcity</b> 
  is a daily comic strip which chronicles the adventures of Rands, Pants, Spigot 
  and Deuce in a world of waking up late and <a href="/library/crime/drugs/marijuana/">getting high before breakfast</a>. 
Jerkcity is available for your viewing pleasure at 
<a href="http://www.jerkcity.com/" target="_blank">www.jerkcity.com</a>. 
The 
  first strip was published on <a href="http://www.jerkcity.com/jerkcity1.html" target="_blank">August 17, 1998</a> and over 2,600 strips later, Jerkcity 
  blinks and a birthday number five appears on the horizon. Where the phrase "comic 
  strip" might imply comedy in newspaper comic strip form, Jerkcity happily accepts 
  this label to be categorized and linked-to. After all, Jerkcity does appear 
  to be a comic strip, a net.comic otherwise known as a web comic.</p>
<p>The strip is, according to Jerkcity's creator Rands Pantalones, "a story told 
  out of order." Recurrent themes permeate the work: drinking, drug abuse, pornography, 
  homosexual/homophobic ravings, anger, confusion, dick jokes and what one might 
  call an antidote to the good-natured "geek humor" that defines hobby-centric 
  subcultures in online communities.

<p>This is clearly the work or rather a product of Generation X: not 
  selling anything and not easily accessible to the world at large. No product manufacturer in their 
  right mind would want to associate their brand with this train wreck. Somebody's 
  time and effort into these digital scribbles has gone beyond the usual 33 strips 
  that a new comic strip creator churns out before forgetting to pay the website bill. In a world where Stephen King's name is set in the largest point size 
  available for book covers, one has to hunt and peck to learn anything about 
  Jerkcity and its creators.</p>
<p><img src="/library/culture/jerkcity/jerkcity1591.gif" height="289" width="289" hspace="15" vspace="15" align="right"> At 
  times, the characters appear to be self-aware, but not concerned about quality, 
  timing or whether or not the jokes make sense. Keyboard and terminal jokes suggest 
  chat transcripts are involved. The tone is clear: all the little creatures in 
  Jerkcity seem to practice <a href="/library/sex/masturbation/">self-abuse</a> regularly (noisily, publicly) as evidenced by a frequent onomotopaeic representation of cocksucking, a sort of "HUALGHLAHGLUAHLUAHLUAG" noise. 

The residents of Jerkcity want 
  nothing more than to drink in a corner and shout things out every once in a 
  while. Participation seems forced at times, like badly-produced dinner theater 
  or a Christmas play performed by the mentally retarded. At one point in the 
  strip's history, the characters went on strike and a different cartoon was included 
  for a week.</p>
<p>The comic strip comes with another feature: small grey messages which appear 
  from time to time. Where the author should be demanding to be released from 
  that which is a Chinese Fortune Cookie Factory, he instead scrawls dirty notes 
  and angry rants. Where a professional strives to develop a style, a unique voice 
  or tell a story, Jerkcity wanders off and sits in the weeds, sometimes for days 
  at a time. You read it every day, and it's good for you like fresh green roughage.</p>
<p>One cartoon was published entirely in <a href="/library/language/artificial-languages/esperanto/">Esperanto</a>. Once, a character <a href="http://www.jerkcity.com/jerkcity1110.gif" target="_blank">complained</a> 
  about an irksome feature of OpenBSD, <img src="/library/culture/jerkcity/jerkcity1583.gif" height="289" width="289" hspace="15" vspace="15" align="left"> an 
  act that did not go unnoticed by the developers. These brief bursts of annoying 
  behavior are usually followed by a sea of the usual fare: Nine-eyed alien Pants 
  describes punching a prostitute and tries to pass it off as "helping her off 
  the stage." Rands and another character, Hanford, go about the business of being 
  stage managers. For the most part, their efforts are unsuccessful. <a href="http://www.jerkcity.com/jerkcity1332.html" target="_blank">Deuce</a> will not cooperate and <a href="http://www.jerkcity.com/pants/" target="_blank">Pants</a> is making <a href="/library/crime/drugs/marijuana/">bong noises</a>, 
  a series of uppercase and lowercase o's. Spigot, in sandals and a black beret 
  makes a plaintive request: WHO CARES ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IF THE GOVERNMENT SHOT 
  MARTIN LUTHER KING? (beat) THE POINT IS I'M HUNGRY.</p>
<p>The strip is created with <a href="/library/crime/corporate/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> Comic Chat, a chat application that might 
  otherwise be ignored except for Microsoft's decision to use the IRC protocol 
  and the artwork of Jim Woodring. Woodring's unique style can be described as 
  other-worldly, disturbing and playful. Woodring licensed his artwork to Microsoft, 
  according to the EULA distributed with the application, and has nothing to do 
  with this project.</p>
<p> Jerkcity is easy to dismiss as an experiment of culture-jamming, an art project, 
  or just a mean-spirited prank like something which blurts "FUCK" at the end 
  of search engine results or the <a href="/library/language/the-finger/">middle finger</a> of <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/music/eminem/">Eminem</a>. Where its longevity, 
  creepy anonymous qualities and cruel spirit suggest a hoax out of control, one 
  can easily imagine other scenarios. Somewhere, far away, a little creature suffered 
  brain damage and is stuck in a loop, forever cranking out angry little images. 
  They may be of varying quality and questionable taste, but every day there's 
  a new paragraph to Jerkcity's never-ending graphic novel. Like so many things 
  before it - sardines, punk rock, <a href="/library/sex/sodomy/">sodomy</a> - Jerkcity is not for everybody.
