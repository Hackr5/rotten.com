<h1>HELLO KITTY</h1>

<h2>Has No Mouth and She Must Scream</h2>

Created in 1974 by Sanrio, Hello Kitty has become the single most popular cartoon character in <a href="/library/history/countries/japan/">Japan</a>. While most popular universal characters like Snoopy or Mickey Mouse have scads of creative output that led to the merchandising of their images, Hello Kitty has avoided that time-consuming process and cut right to the chase. Hello Kitty (and related Sanrio characters) have been licensed out to so many items in so many ways that it's almost untraceable. <b>If an item is capable of sustaining a Hello Kitty-shaped icon for any period of time, then that item has been made and sold.</b>

"Surely, you're being dramatic" you might say. No, no we're not. Hello Kitty notebooks? Yup. Hello Kitty computers? Done it. Motorcycles? Yes. Toasters? Yes. <a href="/library/sex/dildos/">Vibrators</a>? <i>Yes.</i> Sanrio might know the exact number, but over <i>ten thousand items</i> have recieved their permission to put Hello Kitty's visage upon them.
<p>

In the quarter-century plus that this Feline Merchandise-ball has rolled back and forth across Japan, it's only stressed the obvious: <i>Japanese are <a href="/library/culture/godzilla/">weird,</a> <a href="/library/sex/rape/tentacle-rape/">strange</a> people who do odd things in large groups.</i> Hello Kitty is just an easy-to-demonstrate manifestation of that. "The universalization of cute" or "The icon-laden society of cutting-edge-japanese", the media will write, grappling for the right combination of words to describe a general trait in the Japanese Population: <i>Adapt it, sell it, improve it, and sell it again, hopefully all within the same week.</i>
<p>

Speculate all you want about the "meaning" of Hello Kitty, but realize that the whole of the philosophy can be summed up in one cry, one single sound: The sound of a cash register going <i>ka-ching</i>.
