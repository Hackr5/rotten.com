<h1>Brazil</h1>

<p><i>"Because I dislike being quoted, I lie almost constantly when talking 
  about my work."</i> </p>
  
<p>In 1975, former <a href="/library/culture/monty-python/">Monty Python</a> cast member and celebrated animator <b>Terry 
  Gilliam</b> had a great idea for a movie. Along with playwright Tom Stoppard 
  <i>(Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead)</i>, he'd write and direct a sweeping, 
  epic masterpiece about a world gone wrong.</p>
<p>The film would take place "somewhere in the twentieth century." It 
  would feature an oppressive, totalitarian government which systematically stripped 
  the public of its basic freedoms in favor of an ostensibly fraudulent and hopeless 
  war on <a href="/library/crime/terrorism/">terrorism</a>. The term "information retrieval" would be used implicitly 
  throughout the film, a euphemistic nickname for the gruesome <a href="/library/history/torture/">torture</a> techniques 
  applied to suspected <a href="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/">terrorists</a> as they're kidnapped, secured, and readied for 
  interrogation.</p>
<p>The mechanics and systems of this "fantastical" world would need 
  to be absurd and contradictory, serving only to bury its chief directors under 
  bureaucracy, red tape, and endless coils of administrative paperwork. Identification 
  cards, DNA scans and security checkpoints would round out Gilliam's view of 
  a monolithic, technologically-driven society, and patriotic propaganda posters 
  telegraphing a <img src="bra3.jpg" width="500" height="274" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">mandatory 
  us-or-them mentality would be broadcast regularly to all citizens amidst the 
  false cheeriness of a consumer theme park culture.</p>
<p><i>Brazil</i> would be an opus of visual metaphors, bleak slapstick, and unconventional 
  narrative awash in elaborate special effects, <a href="/library/religion/apocalypse/">apocalyptic</a> scenes of destruction, 
  and a general lack of discipline.The plot would sprawl and wander through corporate 
  conspiracies, office politics, oedipal nightmares, and the operatic love-struck 
  daydreams of Sam Lowry, the story's central protagonist.</p>
<p>Gilliam's 1981 movie <i>Time Bandits</i> had grossed nearly $36 million in 
  the United States alone, despite being rejected by every major studio and distributor. 
  In the early eighties, <i>Brazil</i> was given a green light. Together with 
  independent producer Arnon Milchan, Gilliam and Stoppard pitched their idea 
  to Universal and Fox. Universal secured the American rights, Fox got the international, 
  and the struggle to make it all happen would end up being an epic battle unto 
  itself.</p>
<p><img src="bra4.jpg" width="500" height="277" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">"<i>Brazil</i> 
  was a film that sat around for some years," Gilliam remembers. "I 
  mean like ten years I'd been sort of thinking about this thing. It's all about 
  my own frustrations and my seeming inability to achieve what I wanted to achieve 
  and my inability to affect a system that is clearly wrong. The fears of <i>Brazil</i> 
  are not so much that the world is spinning out of control because of the system, 
  because the system is us. What <i>Brazil</i> is really about is that the system 
  isn't great leaders, great machinating people controlling it all. It's each 
  person performing their job as one little cog in this thing and Sam chooses 
  to stay a little cog and ultimately he pays the price for that."</p>
<p>Gilliam wanted <i>Brazil</i> to emulate Port Talbot, a small steel town in 
  South Wales where everything the eye can see is blanketed with a fine layer 
  of gray iron ore dust. "Even the beach is completely littered with dust, 
  it's just black. I had this image of a guy sitting there on this dingy beach 
  with a portable radio, tuning in <i><img src="bra5.jpg" width="500" height="274" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></i>these 
  strange Latin escapist songs like <i>Brazil</i>. The music transported him somehow 
  and made his world less gray." Over time, this man on the beach evolved 
  into Sam Lowry.</p>
<p>The set pieces and sound stages which really carry <i>Brazil</i> were intended 
  to look like an entire century compacted into a single moment -- i.e. the 1940s 
  and the 2000s smashed together. Filming took place all over the world in order 
  to accommodate the richly textured look Gilliam intended. The clerk's pool where 
  Sam Lowry works in the Records Department was shot in an abandoned grain mill 
  in London's Dockland. The mill was sprayed with gray paint, and flour sifters 
  were turned into benches. This same location was used for the corridors of the 
  Information Retrieval department where Sam goes after being promoted: the giant 
  holes in the ceiling are actually the bottoms of twelve story high grain silos. 
  The truck chase sequence (where Lowry and Jill Layton outrun security pursuit 
  vans) was filmed at the Marne la Vallee in <a href="/library/history/countries/france/">France</a>, a huge apartment complex 
  designed by Ricardo Bofil and the current site of Euro <a href="/library/crime/corporate/disney/">Disney</a>. The Information 
  Retrieval chamber where Sam is interrogated was filmed in a cooling tower at 
  a power station in Southern England. Stunt men on cables descended a distance 
  of 170 feet to make their way inside. In the editing room, Gilliam <img src="noses.jpg" width="500" height="276" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">found 
  himself looking at hundreds of reels of truly astounding and remarkable footage, 
  and while biting his nails he wondered how in the world he could possibly make 
  this film any shorter than five hours. Gilliam's modest, 20-week shoot ended 
  up lasting nine months and barely recouped its $15 million dollar budget -- 
  largely the fault of producer Thomas Schuly who unwisely announced that <i>Brazil</i> 
  was going to be the biggest production since <i>Cleopatra</i>.<br>
  <br>
  In September of 1985, Gilliam and Milchan brought <i>Brazil</i> to the American 
  Film Festival in Deauville, France -- an annual homage to American cinema which 
  attracts major stars. They tracked down festival organizers, and asked if the 
  festival might like to show the American version of <i>Brazil</i>. The film 
  was was hastily inserted as a festival film surprise at eleven o'clock at night, 
  and became the world premiere. It was a thunderous success, earning a spot on 
  the CBS Evening News and an article in Variety magazine. </p>
<p>However, Universal CEO Sidney Sheinberg was less than pleased. He sent a protest 
  to Milchan, reminding him that he and Gilliam were <b>violating their contracts</b> 
  by talking about Universal's version of <i>Brazil</i>, and they certainly shouldn't 
  be <b>showing it,</b> <img src="tower.jpg" width="500" height="277" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">since 
  there were a few "unresolved issues" about the movie which needed 
  to be addressed. It turns out that after Universal ran some test screenings 
  in America, pressure was building to "edit" the film before it could 
  be released. See, it might "play better" if the running time was cut 
  from 142 minutes to ninety-seven. And it needs a happy ending. </p>
<p>Sheinberg himself, whose own executive producer credits include <i>Playing 
  Mona Lisa, Slappy and the Stinkers,</i> and <i>The Pest,</i> began hacking away 
  at the film. His editors (Bill Gordean and Steve Lovejoy) created a version 
  which looked less like Gilliam's masterpiece and more like a mawkish, cloying 
  <b>love story.</b> Subtracted were necessary dream sequences offering contrast 
  to the gray landscape. Gone were essential dramatic points along a cohesive 
  plot. What was left? Spliced, disparate elements of vague humor and footage 
  involving Sam pursuing his "dream girl" Jill Layton.</p>
<p>Gordean and Lovejoy's ultimate crime was lopping off the <b>entire ending sequence</b> 
  involving Sam Lowry's interrogation and loss of sanity. Instead, the film ends 
  with a pastoral countryside pullback, where Sam and Jill finally consummate 
  their relationship. Musical composer <img src="27b.jpg" width="500" height="269" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Michael 
  Kamen's brilliant orchestral, symphonic score was replaced as well -- with <b>rock 
  music</b> meant to "attract the teens." The whole movie had become 
  a cliche factory. Arnon Milchan, the producer of the film, began making public 
  declarations on how the studio had taken away Gilliam's film because it was 
  only a few minutes over contractual obligation, and began calling for critics 
  to see the film in England, where it was available from Fox Pictures. Sid Sheinberg 
  responded back by saying that no amount of critical praise could reverse the 
  studio's decision about <i>Brazil</i>. Gilliam told Sheinberg that if he was 
  going to release to studio's edit of <i>Brazil</i> that he wanted his name off 
  of the credits.</p>
<p>Kamen was horrified. He'd worked long and hard to insure that the <i>Brazil</i> 
  soundtrack would be loved by all, and indeed be a career-defining release. He 
  remembers the bad news vividly: "They had removed my score from <i>Brazil</i> 
  and replaced it with pop music. <img src="car.jpg" width="500" height="266" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Well, 
  first time for me, even more insulting, I consider myself a pop musician, a 
  rock and roller. And an oboe player. I am a dessert topping <i>and</i> a floor polish. 
  I am both. So, I did not even want to go outside to walk down the street. I 
  was sure everybody -- like in a Bunuel film -- was pointing at me and laughing. 
  I was crushed. But as time went on they did put the score to the film. There 
  was a funny anecdote that years later I happened to have a publishing deal as 
  we composers do, we make deals. In that case to but my house. And we made a 
  deal with MCA, a division of Universal. The people who were guilty for <i>Brazil</i>. 
  And they never did release the album. I made the album and handed it in and 
  there was a bruhaha over it. They were so upset. They picked up the album and 
  they threw it down and said: this comes out over my dead body. Something Sheinberg 
  said. So they never released the album and I was still hurting from it. And 
  then they did not sell the film anyway." Fans of the movie would have to 
  wait eight years before the soundtrack was ultimately released.</p>
<p><img src="bra2.jpg" width="500" height="274" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Gilliam's 
  intended parable of dehumanization was wholly subverted by Sheinberg's edit, 
  defeating the entire purpose of <i>Brazil</i>, and smooshing the movie into a futuristic 
  fairy tale about a man's quest for a love -- with overextended action sequences 
  and a subplot about terrorism thrown in for flavor. Sheinberg felt that even 
  at 132 minutes, the film would fail. Much to Gilliam's surprise, Sheinberg's 
  editors called him at his London home asking for his input on the new version. 
  Gilliam had no input. He knew they had a crap film, because Gilliam had sent 
  the crap himself. He kept his own cut of the film and shipped Sheinberg's editors 
  only the outtakes, the blooper reels, and unusable footage.</p>
<p><img src="sparks.jpg" width="500" height="274" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">In 
  the documentary <i>The Battle of Brazil,</i> Gilliam reflects on this outrage: 
  "What do you mean you want my input? You're not saving my film. You're 
  killing my film. You're destroying my film. You're holding my child and you're 
  asking which limb do you want cut off." Terry Gilliam referred to this 
  cut as <i>Sid Sheinberg's Brazil</i>. Others called it the <i>Love Conquers 
  All</i> remix, while those in the fringe labeled it the <i>Happy Ending</i> 
  cut, in reference to handjobs, prostitution, and the erotic massaging of a proud 
  masterpiece into a limp noodle. </p>
<p>Over a year later, the publicity war began. In Gilliam's own words, "It 
  became a stalemate situation. Arnon Milchan, the producer said we've got to 
  get lawyers in here and we've got to deal with this -- and I said nah, can't 
  get lawyers in. They've got all the lawyers in the world. They've got all the 
  money. They don't have to release the film, it's not going to kill them. They 
  can sit on it. We'll just have to approach it in a much more personalized way. 
  So the first thing I did was to take a full page ad out in <i>Variety. </i> The ad read: DEAR SID SHEINBERG, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO RELEASE MY FILM 'BRAZIL'? When 
  the idea came up, I just decided to leap in and do it. And the minute I got 
  my <i>Variety</i> and opened it and saw it, that was the moment. I just went 
  <i>oh fuck,</i> what have I done? <i>Oh shit, oh no.</i> And that lasted about 
  five minutes and then it was <i>okay, it's done</i>."<br>
  <br>
  <img src="truck.jpg" width="500" height="273" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Gilliam 
  didn't get an answer from Sheinberg right away. He did get a letter from Robert 
  DeNiro, who in the film plays outlaw freelance repairman (and terrorist) Harry 
  Tuttle. DeNiro's letter read: "Dear Terry. We're all in this together. 
  Harry Tuttle. P.S. Watch out for all the paperwork."</p>
<p>When quizzed about his now adversarial relationship with Universal, Gilliam 
  remained firm, attempting to make the battle as personal as possible: "I 
  have a problem with a man named Sid Sheinberg and he looks like this!" 
  Gilliam then pulled out an 8x10 glossy of Sheinberg and pointed to it on national 
  television. "He is the one man standing in the way of America seeing one 
  of the greatest films ever made."</p>
<p>The <i>Variety</i> ad tickled the fancy of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, 
  who were now immensely curious about the film. Since Gilliam was not allowed 
  to show <i>Brazil</i> in North America, he'd been screening the film for critics 
  in clandestine locations. It was unanimous: the Association chose <i>Brazil</i> 
  as the year's best picture. Gilliam won Best Director, and Gilliam, Charles 
  McKeown, and Tom Stoppard were awarded Best Screenplay. <img src="tubes.jpg" width="500" height="274" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Universal 
  released the film two weeks later, where it received Oscar nominations for both 
  its script and Norman Garwood's stunning production design. Universal Pictures, 
  which has the tradition of running a full page ad in <i>Variety</i> congratulating 
  winners if the winning movies are their own, forced Sheinberg to capitulate.</p>
<p>Commercially in America, the film did only moderately well. Universal gave 
  it virtually no advertising support, instead focusing their efforts on <i>Out 
  of Africa</i>, which went on to win seven Academy Awards. In the film, Meryl 
  Streep runs a coffee plantation and gets V.D.</p>
<p>Today, there are five different versions of <i>Brazil:</i> The Fox European 
  theatrical release, the American 132-minute theatrical and video release, the 
  original European/Japanese video and laserdisc release, the "Final Director's 
  Cut" Criterion Collection DVD set, and the miserable Sheinberg edit -- 
  which unfortunately can still be seen from time to time on broadcast television. 
  <i>Brazil</i> is regarded by many critics, historians, filmmakers, and film 
  buffs as one of the most original and influential movies of the past fifty years. 
  Best-selling fantasy author Harlan Ellison declared <i>Brazil </i>"the 
  finest science fiction movie ever made."</p>
<p><img src="fin.jpg" width="500" height="274" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Eight 
  years later, <i>Brazil</i> musical composer Michael Kamen remembered a key exchange 
  while renegotiating his contract with MCA, which had accidentally lapsed: "I 
  had a chance now. I said: 'Listen, there is an album somewhere in your vaults 
  probably in LA. And it is sitting on a shelf some place. I have been waiting 
  for this album to come out for eight years. It is from a film called <i>Brazil</i>. 
  And I would like that released. I won't even take your fucking phone call until 
  I see that album in the record stores.' And I left. And they did make the phone 
  call, and the album came out, but by that time I had already another publishing 
  deal with a much bigger advance." </p>
<p>Gilliam went on to direct <i>The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Fisher 
  King,</i> <i>Twelve Monkeys,</i> and <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i>. 
  He jokingly refers to <i>Brazil</i> as the second of a trilogy of movies (the 
  first and third being <i>Time Bandits</i> and <i>Munchausen</i>, respectively). 
  The three films share a related theme of the struggle for imagination and free 
  thinking in a world constantly suppressing such ideas. Gilliam's struggle (and 
  ultimate failure) to film <i>The Man Who Killed Don Quixote</i> was outlined 
  in the film <i>Lost in La Mancha</i>. The documentary offers a fascinating, 
  educational autopsy of a movie idea Gilliam was forced to abandon after a disastrous 
  six-day film shoot was marred by noisy NATO helicopters, horrendous hail storms, 
  physically fragile actors, and Johnny Depp.</p></p>
