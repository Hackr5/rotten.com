  In 1984, director David Lynch turned down an opportunity to direct <em>Return 
  of the Jedi</em> in favor of teaming up with wanna-be-bankrupt Dino DeLaurentiis 
  productions for a movie version of Frank Herbert's sprawling epic <em>Dune, 
  </em>first published in 1965. The story is a melodramatic mish-mash of all the 
  most commonly hacked-out space opera fantasies ever explored by human beings: 
  political statements, environmental issues, romantic and religious themes. An 
  empire millennia in the year 10,191. An oppressed people. A commodity of vast 
  value and importance. A noble family. A hyperactive, nefarious villain bordering 
  on the ridiculous, a <em>jihad</em> on a galactic scale, and phallo-centric 
  creatures of the desert euphemistically referred to as Sand Worms.</p>
<p>Without reading earlier drafts, Lynch went to work on a screenplay capable 
  of satisfying his vision. "The most difficult aspect of course, was being 
  true to the whole," he remarked in <em>Prevue</em> magazine. "I couldn't 
  reduce it to the point where the story's essence is lost - millions of fans 
  would feel raped!"</p>
<p>The four-year production expanded to include Sting, Kyle Maclachlan, Patrick 
  Stewart, Alicia Witt, Max von Sydow, Dean Stockwell, Sean Young, Jack Nance, 
  and an uncredited cameo by Lynch as a Spice worker. After reviewing the finished 
  project, Lynch was so horrified by his efforts that he lobbied to have his name 
  removed from the credits altogether. The actors and actresses appeared embarrassed 
  just standing there, and numerous elements of the film dripped with unintentional 
  homoeroticism worthy of <a href="/library/culture/ambiguously-gay-duo/">The Ambiguously Gay Duo</a>. Production assistants quietly 
  wondered amongst themselves if they weren't just collaborating to manufacture 
  more of Frank Herbert's <i>Dung.</i></p>
<p><img src="dune.jpg" width="269" height="430" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Even 
  Sting's opinion of the film slowly morphed over time as he came to realize <i>Dune</i> 
  would be inextricably linked to his reputation and career:</p>
<p><b>September, 1983:</b> "I met David and I loved him. He's a madman in 
  sheep's clothing, and I just felt I had to do the movie because I know he's 
  going to do something extraordinary."</p>
<p><b>July 1985:</b> "I didn't even like the film, I don't have a clue what 
  it was about, it was very confusing."</p>
<p><b>November 1987:</b> "I refuse to take responsibility for any film I'm 
  in. It's the directors movie."</p>
<p><b>May, 1998:</b> "There's no actor who's been in nothing but great movies, 
  nothing but successes. You can make a few lousy movies in relative obscurity."</p>
<p><b><img src="dune_viewmaster.jpg" width="133" height="252" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">April, 
  1998:</b> "I was flicking through the channels in a hotel room in the Midwest. 
  Suddenly there they were, the flying underpants. They were great but very tricky 
  to get on under your flares. I still don't actually know what <i>Dune</i> was 
  about and I don't know if anyone did."</p>
<p>"I started selling out on <em>Dune</em>," Lynch recalls. "Looking 
  back, it's no one's fault but my own. I probably shouldn't have done that picture, 
  but I saw tons and tons of possibilities for things I loved, and this was the 
  structure to do them in. there was so much room to create a world. But I got 
  strong indications from Dino De Laurentiis of what kind of film they expected, 
  and I knew I didn't have final cut. And little by little - and this is the danger, 
  because it doesn't happen in chunks, it happens in the tiniest little shavings, 
  little sandings - little by little every decision was always made with them 
  in mind and their sort of film. Things I felt I could get away with within their 
  framework. So it was destined to be a failure, to me." </p>
<p><img src="dune_recordedinterview.jpg" width="260" height="215" hspace="19" vspace="19" align="left">To 
  this day, the only people who claim <em>Dune</em> is a great movie are those 
  who developed a grade-school fondness for the series of novels. Abstract rumors 
  regularly circulate in excitable chat rooms and sci-fi conventions: have you 
  heard about the <em>four </em>hour version? The <em>six </em>hour version? What 
  about the director's "choice cut" <strong>ten hour</strong> version? 
  The legacy of <em>Dune</em> includes eight sequels (by Frank Herbert, his son 
  Brian and other authors), two television miniseries on the SciFi channel, five 
  computer games, countless Marvel comics, action figures, birthday party plates, 
  board games, and Viewmaster discs.</p>
<p>"In retrospect," laments Lynch, "I can see that I started getting 
  into trouble with <em>Dune</em> early on, and it wasn't just the final editing 
  that did it, although I think the film could be way, way of better. I still 
  worry that I don't know if it could ever be a great film, or even a real good 
  film. I don't know. I forget so much about it." </p>
