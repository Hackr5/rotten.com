<h1>The Who</h1>

<ul>
<li> Keith Moon, died of a <a href="/library/crime/drugs/overdose-deaths/">drug overdose</a>.
<li> John Entwhistle, died of a <a href="/library/crime/drugs/overdose-deaths/">drug overdose</a>.
<li> Pete Townshend, alleged <a href="/library/sex/homosexuality/bisexuality/">Bisexuality</a>. We only list this because it gives <i>Rough Boys</i> new meaning.
<blockquote>
"It was that song, which is ironic because the song is actually taunting both the homosexuals in America--who were, at the time, dressing themselves up as Nazi generals--and the punks in Britain dressing the same way. I thought it was great that these tough punks were dressing as homosexuals without realizing it. I did an interview about it, saying that Rough Boys was about being gay, and in the interview I also talked about my "gay life," which--I meant--was actually about the friends I've had who are gay. So the interviewer kind of dotted the t's and crossed the i's and assumed that this was a coming out, which it wasn't at all. But I became an object of ridicule when it was picked up in England. It was a big scandal, which is silly. If I were bisexual, it would be no big deal in the music industry. If I ran down a list of the men who have tried to get me into bed, I could bring down quite a few big names in the music business. And no, I won't do it." -- <i>Playboy</i> interview

<li> Pete Townshend, arrested on child pornography charges.
