<h1>Stun Guns </h1>

<p>Know what you can get for about forty bucks? A <b>stun gun.</b> Think about
  it: a hand-held, battery operated device no larger than an iPod, suitable for
  jabbing into strangers, rendering them temporarily immobile while you pluck
  the contents of their wallets and steal
  <i>their</i> iPods. Or maybe you're just tired of girls saying no -- if only
  people could just get to know you better! </p>
<p>Let's spin the globe and witness
  how individuals throughout the world -- in law enforcement and the private
  sector -- are using their stun guns. Unless you're the one holding the device,
  the following scenarios and situations are indeed those which you might
    want to avoid. </p>
<p><img src="sg_copper.jpg" width="272" height="181" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >In
  June of 2003, Carlisle police in Pennsylvania were called to a convenience
  store, where 53 year-old Tom Gruver was observed drunk-like and incoherent,
  attempting to get into his car. To stop him, police used a stun gun. Unfortunately,
  Mr. Gruver wasn't drunk -- he was in diabetic shock. He described being Tasered,
  "kinda like grabbing ahold of a bare electric wire."</p>
<p>Shopping mall security
  guards are now in cahoots with local police to make sure you get zapped post-haste
  if you linger too long in front of Hot Dog on a Stick. Flint Township police
  electrocuted a 23 year old in 2006 after he refused to leave the Genesee Valley
  shopping center in Michigan. Christ, dudes! What if he was looking for the
  Stun Gun Outlet? </p>
<p><img src="sg_oliver.jpg" width="190" height="214" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Remember
  former heavyweight champion Oliver McCall, who knocked out Lennox Lewis for
  the WBC heavyweight title in 1994? <b>Of
  course you don't.</b> McCall got into a bit of a
  scuffle after police officers spotted him trespassing in a public housing development
  in Nashville, Tennessee. Police asked him if lived in the area, and then directed
  his attention toward the NO TRESPASSING signs. McCall, 250 pounds and well
  over 6-foot-2, informed them that he was indeed a former heavyweight champion,
  the one who knocked out Lennox Lewi-- <b>oh
  my God </b>he's
  running away. <i>He's fleeing the interview!</i> Come back, we just wanna talk!
  Methinks I know where this is going. </p>
<p><img src="sg_tg.jpg" width="200" height="207" align="left" />Officers hauled
  out their <i><b>Taser</b></i> guns
  -- extremely high voltage weapons which really do resemble guns -- and rendered
  the former boxer down for the count. Tasers mimic and scramble your body's
  natural electrical signals, temporarily disconnecting your brain from your
  nervous system to shut down your muscles. Tiny probing darts fastened
  to thin copper wires are expelled by compressed air from the Taser, discharging
  <img src="sg_zap.jpg" width="170" height="170" align="right" />a five-second
  burst of electricity averaging 50,000 volts in the direction of the suspect.
  These flying electrodes are capable of penetrating Level III body armor, where
  they sink into the skin and bring you to your knees. The average bug zapper
  only delivers about 2,000 volts, so just <b>be cool.</b></p>
<p>To purchase official <i>Taser International</i> products on the Web, you're
  required to create a user account and fill out an online form which asks for
  your social security number, date of birth, and driver's licence information.
  If you put in <b>fake</b> information to bypass the bullshit (by claiming you're
  Fag Face from Cocksucker, Colorado) -- the Taser ID cross-checking system will
  return an "unknown identity" alert. You'll then be asked for your <i>previous</i> address,
  so the identity cross-checking can try again.</p>
<p><img src="sg_mccall.jpg" width="404" height="452" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" />Chances
  are, when an officer knocks you down with a Taser gun, they've already sized
  you up as a big problem. Boxer McCall spit at the officers and threatened to
  kill them. Cocaine and a <a href="/library/culture/bongs/">glass pipe</a> were found in his pocket. Eventually he
  was stuffed into a cop car, held on a $299,000 bond, and charged with criminal
  trespassing, resisting arrest, assaulting police officers, threatening to kill
  an officer, <i>and</i> being
  a fugitive from justice on charges from Virginia. McCall's previous arrests
  include <b>throwing
    a Christmas tree</b> in a hotel lobby. As for the former boxer's heavyweight
  status -- well, he tried to win the title back in 1997. During the fifth round,
  he stopped throwing punches and broke out in tears, refusing to leave his corner.
  The fight was cancelled, and the $3,075,000 purse still remains in escrow somewhere
  in a New Jersey bank. Meanwhile, ninety percent of individuals shocked by cops
  are minorities. </p>
<p>The word <b>Taser</b> is the most commercially identifiable brand name
  of a electronic weapons manufacturer. It's not some wackity-ass science fiction
  hybrid of space-age laser beams and magic: TASER stands for <i>Thomas A. Swift's
  Electric Rifle,</i> named
  after a fictional teenage inventor. Who says arms dealers don't have a sense
  of humor? More like stun <i><b>fun!</b></i></p>
<p><img src="sg_hiro.jpg" width="204" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >What
  if you just stun-gunned every single woman you saw walking down the street?
  That's how 57-year-old Hirohito Shibuya of Tokyo managed to accumulate nearly
  a dozen wives and girlfriends -- all at the same time! With a surprisingly
  spry combination of tear gas, stun guns, intimidating sunglasses and military
  fatigues, Hirohito bullied and zapped eleven women -- mostly in their 20s,
  one in her 50s -- into a <b>suburban harem,</b> and prevented them from leaving
  with well-timed jabs of the stun gun. After he was arrested in 2006 and the
  women were set free, neighbors admitted to reporters they thought Hirohito's
  house was actually a waitresses' dormitory, whatever that might be. The press,
  meanwhile, went on to nickname Hirohito "the enchanter". Why not
  just call him <i><b>Hiro-hottie?</b> </i>BZZzzZzZZZzzt.</p>
<p>Don't be mouthin' off at cops in Texas. In 2005, the <i>Houston Chronicle</i> reported
  that police officers Tasered "verbally aggressive" suspects about fourteen
  times over a six month period. Immediately after Tasers were integrated into
  widespread usage throughout the Houston Police Department as an alternative
  to guns or batons, they started "going off" more than once a day. And if you're
  a <b>distressed sixteen-year-old female</b> threatening <a href="/library/death/suicide/famous/">suicide</a> and brandishing
  a knife, consider the extraordinary lengths taken <i><img src="sg_dream.jpg" width="451" height="295" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" lowsrc="10" ></i>by
  Houston cops to bring one such girl back to reality -- testimony delivered
  by Captain J. Jones to <i>ABC
  News</i> affiliate
  KTRK-13: </p>
<p><i>"The officer spoke with the female and the female moved towards
      him, moving the knife over her head. The Taser did not have the
      desired effect. The
female pulled the darts out of her body and continued towards the officer."</i></p>
<p>The
  deputy then fired a shot at the girl. Police say the officer was "stumbling"
  as he fired -- and fired a <b>second shot</b> which grazed the teenager's
  right foot. At that point, a precinct officer showed up and tried to deploy
  pepper spray, but that didn't work either. You just can't keep sad girls down. </p>
<p>In addition to all the suicidal white punks on dope out there roaming the
  earth, electro-shockable weapons are now being deployed on unarmed individuals,
  children, people in restraints, pregnant women, and the physically disabled.
  Increasingly, Taser guns are engaged in lieu of the efforts it might otherwise
  take to dispatch a mental health professional to the scene of a <img src="sg_cruise.jpg" width="349" height="235" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" > disturbance.
  Using categories provided by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, <i>Amnesty
  International</i> demonstrated
  that 52 percent of stun gun cases involved an <b>attempted suicide;</b> 15
  percent involved officers disrupting a <b>crime in progress;</b> 13 percent
  were individuals
  <b>fleeing,</b> and 5 percent were "undetermined", which takes into account
  suspects with a bit of sass mouth. The combined instances of a suspect <b>attacking
  a police officer</b> or a civilian  accounted for -- <i>eh</i> -- 14 percent
  of the total. In Watsonville, California, officers fired off Taser guns 19
  times within the first six months of issue. A man in Nashville, Tennessee was
  Tasered nineteen times by police officers -- he died shortly thereafter. </p>
<p>Indeed, tasers can be set anywhere from mild to murder. Stun guns
  kill people all the time; the first Taser death in recorded history was a man
  in Cook County, Illinois who received a 50,000-volt shock lasting a record <b>57
  seconds.</b> Most people can't even hold their breath for that long, but what
  are you gonna <img src="sg_hold.jpg" width="450" height="267" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >
  do, the dude was on <a href="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/">meth</a>.</p>
<p>In southwest Florida, <i>NBC
  2</i> reports
  Tracy Shippy was Tasered after she was seen "thrashing about a Hallmark store,"
  swinging a piece of metal, perhaps protesting the outrageous cost of vanilla
  pumpkin-spice <i>Cathy</i> candles.</p>
<p>Minutes after being stun-gunned, Shippy
  died -- and later, an autopsy detected traces of cocaine in her system. Of
  all the stun gun deaths in Houston, so far 100% have been the result of individuals
  on a drug similar to cocaine. Approximately 140 people in the United
  States and Canada had already died of stun gun jabs by February of 2006 --
  in keeping with Taser International spokesman Steve Tuttle's relatively flat
  May 2004 statement to the <i>Atlanta
  Journal Constitution:</i> "the
  number of TASER-related deaths will continue to increase with the
  number of devices we sell." Or lose! There's a <b>missing</b> Taser gun somewhere
  in the wilds of Wisconsin. Sergeant Steve Mads<img src="sg_violent.jpg" width="330" height="280" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >en
  of the Racine Police Department reported in February of 2006 that when a patrol
  officer returned from his shift, he discovered the Taser's plastic holster
  broken and the stun gun missing. Hopefully it can find a good home. </p>
<p>Perhaps nobody deserves more of swift, disciplinary <b>zap</b> than our nation's
  schoolchildren. Thanks to ever-escalating chemical doses of genetically modified
  enzymes (which make cows produce larger, saggier udders of milk, and porkbellies
  produce fatter, greasier slabs of meat) fast-food lovin' adolescents in their
  early teens can be as overweight and aggressive as full-grown adult football
  players. The same goes for junk food snackin' teenage girls -- only they develop
  bigger asses and firmer boobs by age eleven, so there's no real need to use
a stun gun. Come on now.</p>
<p><img src="sg_fight.jpg" width="237" height="171" align="right" >In February
  of 2006, a Mimi-Dade grand jury agreed not to propose an outright ban on stun
  guns to subdue children. In Florida, public school security officers Tasered
  a particularly incensed 6-year-old boy after he was discovered holding a shard
  of glass, and yes, <b>threatening to kill himself.</b> A month later, a Taser was
  used on a 12-year-old girl who was caught skipping class. In both cases, it
  was proposed that a<img src="sg_goat.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >n
  underlying medical condition known as Excited Delirium Syndrome may have been
  to blame for the kids' antics.</p>
<p>Stun guns can also be used on dangerous animals, thank goodness. In South
  Carolina, a particularly gruff <b>billy goat</b> was Tasered <i>three times</i> by
  a Colleton County deputy, after it snapped its leash and charged at citizen
  Dawn Pinette, knocking her to the ground. "All I could do was grab its horns
  and scream bloody murder," Pinette shared with the Associated Press. After
  the Tasering, everyone thought the goat was dead. After a few seconds,
  it hopped back up -- only to be Tasered twice more by officers, who finally
  got the goat into a truck. Baaa-ZZzZ-aaa. </p>
