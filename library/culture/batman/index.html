<h1>Batman</h1>

<p><img src="grocery.jpg" width="315" height="338" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="left"><img src="liba4.jpg" width="202" height="152" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right">The 
  sexual orientation of America's premiere caped crusader has been a point of 
  flaming contention for well over fifty years. For some people, witnessing a 
  cameo by <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/music/liberace/">Liberace</a> as piano-playing villain "Chandel" on the television 
  series is sufficient proof, but let's allow the record to speak for itself.</p>
<p>Batman's earliest uniform was little more than a skin tight, candy-colored 
  leotard which left little to the imagination. Instead of a frilly tutu, there 
  was a utility belt. This ensemble was further complimented by long, sweeping 
  cloakery and a bulging codpiece. Yes, the costuming was all very dandy, and 
  it further cemented an unspoken connection between fruity drama-queen acrobatics 
  and lead actor Adam West's propensity for high camp. <i>Batman</i> the comic, 
  <i>Batman</i> the television program, <i>Batman</i> the animated cartoon and 
  <i>Batman</i> the major motion picture series all cheerfully subscribe to characteristics 
  attributed to male homosexual culture across the globe.</p>
<p>Batman's eagerness to indulge in wrestling or full contact fisticuffs during 
  hand-to-hand combat easily reveals repressed queer intentionality similar to 
  that exhibited by tightly-wound homosexual delinquents who substitute violence 
  for intimacy. Batman's lack of commitment to women, specifically his inability 
  to maintain long-term, close relationships with female partners, is a recurrent 
  theme.</p>
<p><img src="ftr2.jpg" width="150" height="153" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="left">Finally, 
  there's the constant presence of lifelong companion Robin, the boy wonder. They 
  work together, they play together. They slide down poles and try on different 
  outfits. Superhero crime fighters often assume secret identities which imply 
  they're firmly wedged in the closet with mom's lipstick, but Batman and Robin 
  are a truly a dynamic duo. Both conceal vast inner worlds of wrenching conflict 
  from public view. When one considers <em>Batman</em> came into creation during 
  a time in American history when homosexuality was illegal (or a curable mental 
  illness), further credibility to these accusations is readily sustained.</p>
<p><img src="duo.jpg" width="234" height="301" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right">The 
  most probing, penetrating, namblariffic analysis of <i>Batman</i> was originally 
  published in 1954. <i>The Seduction of the Innocent</i> outlined Bellevue Hospital 
  psychiatrist Fredric Wertham's hypothesis that Batman's fraternization with 
  Robin was a daddy-boy relationship, an adolescent-with-adult "Ganymede-Zeus" 
  narrative device operating at harmful, subconscious levels on America's youth.</p>
<p>Wertham's initial essays seized the comics industry with panic and embarrassment as he drew more and more direct links between superheroes, gayness, and juvenile delinquency. <a href="/library/bio/mad-science/william_marston/">Wonder Woman</a> came under fire for hating men and being plainly lesbian. He labeled the union of Batman and Robin the "wish dream of two homosexuals living together".</p><p>From <em>The Seduction of the Innocent:</em></p>
<p><code>Sometimes they are shown on a couch, Bruce reclining and 
  Dick sitting next to him, jacket off, collar open, and his hand on his friend's 
  arm. Like girls in other stories, Robin is sometimes held captive by the villains 
  ... Robin is a handsome aphetic boy, usually showing his uniform with bare legs. 
  He is buoyant with energy and devoted to nothing on earth or interplanetary 
  space as much as to Bruce Wayne. He often stands with legs spread, the genital 
  region discreetly evident.</code>
<p><code>Other times Batman ends up in bed injured, and young Robin 
  is by his side. At home they lead an idyllic life. They are Bruce Wayne and 
  "Dick" Grayson. Bruce is described as a "socialite" and the official relationship 
  is that Dick is Bruce's ward. They live in sumptuous quarters, with beautiful 
  flowers in large vases, and they own a butler, Alfred. Batman is sometimes shown 
  in a dressing gown.</code>
<p><img src="battat.jpg" width="262" height="390" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="left"><img src="movie.jpg" width="150" height="180" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right">Contemporary 
  director Joel Shumacher has been universally applauded by gay groups for further 
  homoeroticising the <em>Batman</em> film franchise by adding to the costumes 
  of Val Kilmer and George Clooney a set of pert nipples, firmer buttocks, and 
  an extended, inflatable codpiece which more or less resembles a grocery basket 
  overstuffed with bananas.
<p>If you're a University student who might like to develop a dissertation which 
  examines homosexual aspects of <em>Batman</em>, be cautioned that your academic 
  output might be limited in scope. Journalists, television producers, content 
  providers, and Web sites are regularly denied copyright access by DC Comics 
  if the angle of your story involves <strong>gayness.</strong></p>
<p>Nevertheless, parody and pop culture analysis continues unabated. In 1996, 
  Robert Smeigel and J.J. Sedelmaier introduced America to superheroes <em>Ace 
  & Gary: <a href="/library/culture/ambiguously-gay-duo/">The Ambiguously Gay Duo</a>. </em>They fight crime while piloting a 
  dynamic supervehicle shaped like an enormous penis. As they battle evil-doers, 
  Ace & Gary pretzel themselves together into suggestive, homoerotic configurations 
  and pat each other on the ass. The initial cartoons were yanked by censors of 
  the <i>Dana Carvey</i> variety show, but <i>The Ambiguously Gay Duo</i> later 
  found a home on <a href="/library/culture/snl/">Saturday Night Live</a>.</p>

  and Robin are gay</a>.</p>
