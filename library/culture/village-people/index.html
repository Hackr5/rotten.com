<h1>The Village People</h1>
<p><img src="village.jpg" width="300" height="293" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Before 
  the Spice Girls, before the Backstreet Boys, and way before Avril Lavigne, the 
  <b>Village People</b> came together as one for a fully branded, corporate concept 
  suitable for smart, colorful packaging and speedy fag-market delivery. The central 
  characters (a cop, a sailor, cowboy, an Indian, a leather enthusiast and a hardhat 
  construction worker) existed in the mind of French record producer Jacques Morali 
  long before the performers were hired in 1977.</p>
<p>It started in New York. Morali's goal was to assemble a campy, vampy, rock-and-roll 
  dance act capable of satisfying a number of specific criteria. First and foremost, 
  this group would make every effort to flaunt homosexual stereotypes in a manner 
  both empowering and appealing to gay men around the world.</p>
<p>The act would be lightweight, compact and portable, capable of performing in 
  small venues like nightclubs and bars - but deliver an over-the-top sound reverberating 
  with masculinity. The costuming, behavior and personas of each performer would 
  overlap throughout universally accepted gay platitudes, so not even a closeted 
  homosexual could effectively declare that this band wasn't reaching out to him.</p>
<p>Before this "dream team" was assembled, Morali had already secured a record 
  deal with Casablanca Records - a studio responsible for producing a series of 
  hits by disco queen Donna "I Will Survive" Summer. Morali hired songwriters 
  Phil Hurtt and Peter Whitehead to compose librettos which gently <i>hinted</i> 
  at gay themes. Two of the initial focus group beta tunes included the following:</p>
<p><b><img src="ymca.jpg" width="448" height="278" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">San 
  Francisco (You've Got Me)</b><br>
  <i>Leather, leather, leather, leather baby<br>
  Levi's and T's are the best now all right<br>
  Folsom, Folsom street on the way to Polk and Castro<br>
  You don't find them finer<br>
  Freedom, freedom is in the air, yeah<br>
  Searching for what we all treasure: pleasure<br>
  Take me to the bay, lead me to it, now, now<br>
  San Francisco / Oh I love ya / Yeah </i></p>
<p><b>Fire Island</b><br>
  <i>Don't go in the bushes, don't go in the bushes<br>
  Don't go in the bushes, someone might grab ya, someone might grab ya<br>
  Don't go in the bushes, don't go, don't go in the bushes<br>
  Don't go in the bushes, someone might stab ya, someone might stab ya<br>
  We can scream, but let's sing<br>
  We can do each other's thing, yeah</i></p>
<p><img src="villagepeople.jpg" width="182" height="264" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Resembling 
  a diverse cross-section of stereotypes commonly observed mixing and mingling 
  in New York's East Village - the Village People were born. <i>San Francisco</i> 
  got them ranked number 50 on UK pop charts, but they really began to flame across 
  the States a year later, with the Top 30 hit <i>Macho Man</i>. This was followed 
  by two international hits, <i>YMCA</i> and <i>In the Navy</i>, hovering for 
  months in first and second place on UK and US charts.</p>
<p>"Jacques Morali had a concept, he had an idea, and we were the flesh and<br>
  blood," remembers Randy Jones, the cowboy. "In Jacques' world, he 
  would have been a music superstar. So he was very protective, and at times manipulative 
  of us. We worked non-stop. We were pushed to the limit. He thought: I'll take 
  their images away and put paint and make-up on them so they can't be easily 
  distinguished, and if they give me a hard time I'll can his ass, I'll fire him. 
  There had to be an element of frustration for Jacques - here you are a gay man 
  who has lots of money, surround by attractive men, yet you are not one of them. 
  I think that really deep in his heart he wanted to be what we were."</p>
<p><img src="villagep3.JPG" width="320" height="180" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Although 
  homosexuals did indeed embrace the group, many in the gay community abandoned 
  fanship when mainstream audiences (straight people) developed a kitschy fondness 
  for the music as well. Over the course of five years, the group was accused 
  of building an empire based largely around the constant recycling a scant handful 
  of tracks.</p>
<p>Their first record (<i>Village People</i>, 1977) contained only four songs. 
  Numerous records thereafter repackaged previously released material available 
  elsewhere. Following albums like <i>I'm A Cruiser</i> and <i>Sex Over The Phone</i> 
  came a string of underappreciated compilations. Titles include <i>The Village 
  People's Greatest Hits, The Best of the Village People,</i> and eventually <i>Twentieth 
  Century Masters: The Essential Millennium Compilation of the Village People.</i></p>
<p>But enough meaningless product promotion - let's go backstage and say hello!
