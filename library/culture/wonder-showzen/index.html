<h1>Wonder Showzen </h1>

<p><i>MTV2</i> is a fast-paced entertainment network largely inspired by the
  Internet and video games. It brings a
  fast-paced mix of music  programs and young-adult lifestyle features
  into approximately 59 million homes. The channel serves as a unit of <i>Viacom,</i> one
  of the world's leading creators of television programming, wireless services,
  and interactive broadband media content across all platforms,
  including <i>Nickelodeon, CMT,</i> and <i>VH1.</i> </p>
<p>Sneaking through this enormous hose pipe is <i>Wonder Showzen,</i> a 
  not-exactly-for-kids program which most closely resembles <i><a href="/library/culture/sesame-street/">Sesame Street</a>,
  Blue's Clues, <a href="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/jerry-falwell/">Teletubbies</a>, Dora The Explorer</i> and <i><a href="/library/bio/misc/fred-rogers/">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</a></i>  all
  smashed together. Between animation, documentary footage, and live-action video
  segments featuring actual children, specific themes and emotions are directly
  injected into the developing subconscious of its <a href="/library/medicine/bodily-functions/nursing/goat-suckling/">youngest viewers</a>. Telegraphed
  messages of hatred, racism, <a href="/library/bio/religion/cult/lyndon-larouche/">paranoia</a>, animal death, <a href="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/">drug use</a>, white people,
  <a href="/library/travel/cities/guanajuato/">Mexico</a>, how hot dogs are really made, how slaves built America, and how using
  one's imagination is dangerous -- to name but a few. The unspoken experience
  of this program inspires images of wide-eyed toddlers staring at the television,
  growing increasingly fragile and freaked out over thirty minutes, while Mom
  putters about in the other room, just happy to have a reliable babysitter. </p>
<p><img src="slaves_wp.jpg" width="347" height="276" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >Portions
  of the program feel like the extended "Altered State of Druggachusetts"
  sequence from <i>Mr. Show</i> -- and even David Cross once described <i>Wonder
  Showzen</i> as "the funniest, most subversive comedy on American T.V.
right now".</p>
<p>The creators of <i>Wonder Showzen,</i> John Lee and Vernon Chatman, met at
San Francisco State. Chatman, a writer for <i>The Chris Rock Show</i> and <i>That's
My Bush</i>  is also the voice of <i>Towlie</i> from <i>South Park.</i> </p>
<p>The program started as
  a brief eight-minute tape which got shopped around to various media outlets.
  Lee told <i>The
  Portland Mercury</i> it's a struggle to get what he wants on the air: "The
  show we really want to make -- that has one hundred percent of what we want
  -- would never make it on TV. It would be so raw, even we wouldn't want to
  watch it". </p>
<p><i>Wonder Showzen</i> enjoys experimenting with forms which tests the limits
  of children and adults. In an first-season episode called <i>Patience,</i> viewers
  are treated to a lengthy sequence of looping segments which are both
  painfully slow and borderline
annoying. At the halfway mark of the program, the entire sequence is reversed
  -- playing backwards for fifteen minutes.  </p>
<p><img src="ws_noogies.jpg" width="326" height="273" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >The
  program is hosted by Chauncy -- a fluffy yellow muppet  with a wiggling
  top hat -- whose presence anchors each episode. Chauncy links
  together the individual sketches and animations, incrementally morphing inflammatory
  and misleading messages into bits of wisdom the viewer can take away. His adventures
  invariably advocate experimenting with drugs, selling your friends for money,
  or killing and cannibalizing God.</p>
<p>A recurring feature is <i>Beat Kids,</i> an uncomfortably-named kid-on-the-street
  showcase of young reporters out in the real world, looking for the scoop. One
  boy goose-steps and stomps around Manhattan dressed as <a href="/library/bio/nazi/adolf-hitler/">Adolf Hitler</a>, waving
  a microphone and asking grownups, "What do you think is wrong with the youth
  of today?" Adults are momentarily stunned by the visceral disconnection between
  the child's clothing and his playful demeanor -- but they don't know how to
  respond to the boy's offer of letting them stay at his "summer camp". </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Hitler kid episode aired during <i>Yom HaShoah,</i> Holocaust
  Remembrance Day. Caryl Stern -- Holocaust survivor and associate national director
  of the ADL -- told one reporter, "There are enough things to do in the world
  that one doesn't have to dress up as Hitler for humor".</p>
<p>After
  the Jewish Anti-Defamation League complained, the segment was removed. <i>Salon</i> reports
  that white supremacists on various message boards have also puzzled over the
show's racial humor. Both the NAACP and the Aryan Nation have expressed
  dismay and displeasure with <i>Wonder Showzen</i>. <i>Catalyst,</i> a mouthpiece for
  the Catholic League fired off a vitriolic press release, citing the show as
  anti-Christian. Unfortunately, the document's anti-<i>Showzen</i> remarks only
  make the program look more entertaining: </p>

<blockquote>
<tt>
<p>On
    March 11, 2005, MTV2, sister channel to MTV and a Viacom subsidiary, aired
  the first episode of a new program called "Wonder Showzen". Seven
  additional episodes were shown throughout the season. MTV2 is planning to air
six new episodes, at a date not yet set.</p>
<p>The show is styled like the PBS show "Sesame Street," with child
  actors, puppets and cartoons. The content, however, is far from child-friendly.
  Gratuitous sexual references and lewd portrayals of all things Christian are
  the norm in this prime-time program.</p>
<p>Many quick and cheap shots at the Church are taken by "Wonder Showzen." In
  one skit, a scrolling tape reading "Catholic Church approves condom-flavored
  breath mints" runs across the screen during a mock newscast. A segment
  in which a little girl writes a letter to her dead grandmother includes mention
  of a priest feeling granny's breasts while she was in the coffin. In another,
  a child answers the question "What is your greatest wish?" with "to
  punch God in the face."</p>
<p>But one episode, titled "History," delves into new levels of
    sickness. A cartoon shows a young boy praying by his bed. An animated Bible
    walks into the bedroom along with a syringe full of heroin, a knife and a
    bottle of liquor. After the Bible injects the heroin and drinks the liquor,
  it performs a sex act with a <a href="/library/sex/prostitution/">prostitute</a>.</p>
<p>As if this isn't enough, the next scene shows a priest reading from the
    Bible in church. The figure of Jesus comes down from the cross and begins
    break dancing. At this point, the rest of the statues in the church transform
  into bikini-clad blondes.</p>

<p><img src="hobo.jpg" width="391" height="270" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >One of the best regular segments involves 1950s-era documentary footage spliced
  together in a manner echoing instructional "how things are made" features
  from <i>Mister
  Rogers' Neighborhood</i>.
  In <i>Wonder Showzen,</i> children recite a rapidfire sequence of endlessly
  hilarious one-liners narrating their trip to the hot dog factory. Pigs
  are unloaded from a truck, then progressively killed and chopped up. Excruciating
  closeups of meat and filth push like Play-Doh through grinders, straining into
  large vats of liquid shit. <i>That's
  what my grandma did on the coffee table,</i> one child remarks. A worker hangs
  hot dogs and sausage links on a rack in a huge oven. <i>That guy's a weiner
  smoker -- I can smell it on him.</i> Then footage of the factory break room
  is shown: adults twisting rubber hoses around their arms and shooting up heroin.
  Finally, actual hot dogs emerge from the other end of the factory, spilling
  onto conveyor belts against the sound of agonizing screams, machine gun fire
and animal death.</p>

<p>The killing of animals is regularly evangelized on <i>Wonder Showzen</i> --
  both directly and indirectly. During the song "Animal
  Dance," footage
  loops forward and back to the sound of a jazzy kazoo: snakes devouring rabbits,
  crocodiles chomping on gazelles, enormous wobbling rhino penises during  mating,
  the splushy, clumsy live birth of yak, red bulbous mouse tumors in a medical
  lab, and a dead zebra carcass lingering in the sun. To suggest the lengthy
  passage of time, instead of cutting to a spinning clock on the wall,
  <i>Wonder Showzen</i> dissolves
  to a dead fox in the forest, rapidly decomposing in time lapse over several
  weeks. In a storyline about an anthropomorphic number "2" trying to kill itself,
  a large black beetle is strapped into a miniature electric chair and set ablaze.</p>
<p><img src="ws_baby.jpg" width="418" height="330" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left"> From time to time, a disturbing video effect warps a portion of the screen
  for a split second. An interview with a cherubic Asian girl gathers horrifying,
  demonic momentum when her eyeballs suddenly appear closer together than they
  were a moment ago. The visual is never addressed outright: she continues her
brief monologue about where babies come from, and the segment moves
  on. Other times, the audio track is slowed to a repetitive growl or layered
  in echoing loops, highlighting one small boy's screams of <b>pills! pills!
  pills! pills! </b> <i>Wonder
  Showzen</i> is at its most effective when you can't fully
  pinpoint <i>why</i> you
feel so paranoid and awful.</p>
<p><i>Entertainment Weekly</i> and <i>Time</i> magazine both attached <i>Wonder
    Showzen</i> to
  their best-of lists for 2005. In an era where "subversive" entertainment
  includes titles like <i>Will
    & Grace</i> and
  <i>Punk'd</i>, Viacom insisted <i>Wonder
    Showzen</i> be
  prefixed with a warning titlecard similar to that featured at the beginning
  of <i><a href="/library/culture/south-park/">South Park</a>,</i> and
  the team obliged:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b><i>Wonder Showzen</i> contains offensive, despicable content
  that is too controversial and too awesome for actual children. The stark, ugly,
  profound truths <i>Wonder Showzen</i> exposes may be soul crushing to the weak
  of spirit. If you allow a child to watch this show, you are a bad parent or
guardian.</b></blockquote>
