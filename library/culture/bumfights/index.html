        has a fascination with homeless people, people living on the streets. 
        Almost a perverse fascination. People don't get a chance to see much of 
        that. We thought it would be exciting to get a glimpse of that kind of 
        life. Fights are part of homeless culture. It's a way for them to vent 
        their anger. We're simply there to video it. "</i></p>
      <p>Ray Laticia and Ty Beeson were "forward-thinking" filmmakers 
        in their early twenties when they spent three years developing the fastest-selling 
        independent video in recent history: <b>Bumfights: A Cause For Concern.</b> 
        One part brutally voyeuristic shockutainment, two parts MTV's <i>Jackass</i> 
        - these $19 VHS tapes and DVDs fly in the face of <a href="/library/bio/mad-science/terence-mckenna/">Terence McKenna</a>'s 
        theory that our tragic universe is running dangerously short of fresh, 
        appealing novelty.</p>
      <img src="OPTJUSTIN-HEADLOCK2.jpg" width="190" height="146" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The 
      premise of this production is brutal and straightforward. Homeless men and 
      women living on the streets of California and Las Vegas (affectionately 
      referred to as <i>bums</i>) are offered cash, food, liquor, clothing, and 
      motel rooms. In exchange, they perform amateur stuntwork without safety 
      nets, erstwhile fisticuffs in public places without protection - or any 
      kind of vicious brawl which might serve to titillate giggling armchair fratboys 
      watching from presumably the same USC or UCLA dormitory once occupied by 
      the video's producers. 
      <p><img src="nue7.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">One 
        on one, two against one, groups versus groups - even trucks against outhouses. 
        Scruffy, toothless vagrants scuffle and skirmish, executing obscene pratfalls 
        with the grace of neither Buster Keaton nor Mr. Bean. We see diseased, 
        urine-stained castaways who wrangle and wrestle like adult homosexuals 
        mutually mouth-rolling the world's last remaining latex condom. The more 
        adventurous exchange violent, bloody facial blows with blunted axes. And 
        if that isn't enough, please enjoy the lovely supermodel Angela Taylor 
        bouncing around on a motel bed during intermissions, flashing her boobs 
        in an engaging strip show! <b><i>You go girl!</i></b></p>
      <p>One prays that the remaining 99% of this backalley Broadway musical has 
        been equally choreographed, but that just isn't the case. On the tape, 
        a man pulls out one of his teeth with pliers. Another sets his hair on 
        fire. Another shits on the sidewalk. They're rewarded with half a pastry. 
        Others jump off buildings and speed down hills in shopping trolleys, and 
        the tape's formidable antihero - <i>"Rufus" the Superstar Stunt 
        Bum</i> - breaks his ankle during a fistfight. Age 47, honorably discharged 
        from the United States Army in May 1982 for injuries sustained during 
        combat training, Rufus is the loudest and most vocal of the bunch, the 
        guy who sports the big huge <b>BUMFIGHTS</b> tattoo across his forehead. 
      </p>
      <p><img src="add8.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Another 
        "bum," Donald Brennan (age 53) was honorably discharged from 
        the United States Army in 1970. He was a member of the 1st Air Cavalry 
        and served a 13-month tour in Vietnam. Mr. Brennan has been decorated 
        with both a Purple Heart and a Silver Star.</p>
      <p>Hardened, angry fists clenching rolls of quarters smash faces, knock 
        out teeth, and bloody eye sockets - all to the charming strains of a punk 
        rock soundtrack. After only a few minutes, it's hard not to feel a bit... 
        <i>(long sigh)</i>... <b>empathetic</b><i> </i>with this entire cast of 
        ne'er-do-wells. It sinks in right away: you're watching sad people down 
        on their luck getting harassed, knocked around, and outright bribed with 
        salted snack treats into bloody confrontations. They're supplied with 
        knife blades in some segments, and pipin' hot vials of <b>crack</b> in 
        others - which they smoke with quiet desperation and refreshed enthusiasm. 
        Drugs and malt liquor fuel infuriating sequences of interracial curb stompings 
        and full-scale riots in awkward, public places. The brawls - and the cameras 
        - continue to roll as horrified passersby call the police, try to break 
        things up, and scramble with paramedics.</p>
      <p><img src="nue4.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">What's 
        the worst thing you've ever done to a homeless guy? Surprised him by shouting 
        <i><b>TIM-MAY!! </b></i>directly into his fat, red face so he drops his 
        clankity cup and all those coins go rolling around every which way and 
        he just stands there tinkling down his pantlegs?</p>
      <p>These homeless people all have something in common. They genuinely appear 
        to believe they're <i>goin' places.</i> They've been selected by honest-to-gosh 
        Hollywood <i>producers</i>. <b>Hollywood, California that is! </b>Let's 
        fool these... these... <i>dumb bum doofuses</i> into thinking they're 
        gonna be the next best thing since <i>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</i>. 
        No, seriously dude. Take this here tuna salad sandwich and put your imagination 
        on. Y'all are gonna <b>explode</b> like wildfire across the big silver 
        screen TV. Audiences root for "underdogs" who can still thrive 
        under adversity. Viewers appreciate <i>reality</i>, and they've come to 
        enjoy a measured sense of progressive, sequential elimination. Fame, financial 
        incentive, and a sure way to pull yourself out of poverty is staring you 
        straight in the <i>face</i>, gentlemen - and you have absolutely <b>nothing 
        to lose!</b> I dare say what you're lookin' at here is a bonafide whirlwind 
        rags-to-riches fairy tale miracle fantasy-dream with angel wings comin' 
        true to life! Okay? Great. Cause tonight we're filming a segment called 
        <b>Bum Hunter.</b></p>
      <p><img src="hunter.jpg" width="750" height="177"></p>
      <p>We're going to creep up on people shivering in sleeping bags, and pin 
        'em down real good. Crikey! This one's getting away! Lucky we've got eight 
        rolls of duct tape! <b><i>Shrrrrrrrick!</i></b> They're hard to tackle, 
        and you don't often see them in the wild. <i><b>Shrrrrrick!</b></i> This 
        one's got a <i>tremendous</i> amount of extra strength! He could be on 
        PCP! We'll stuff him in a van, take his shoes, and release him three days 
        later fifteen blocks away.</p>
      <p><img src="fags.jpg" width="240" height="169" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Don't 
        ya see, dude? <i>Bumfights</i> is like <i>Friends</i> meets <i>Queer Eye 
        For the Straight Guy</i> meets <i>Survivor - </i>starring individuals 
        deprived of food and shelter who are willing to <b>take drugs</b> and 
        <b>suck dicks. </b>They'll be<b> </b>pitted against one another in the 
        controlled, manageable environment of everyday social discord. This kinda 
        shit taps directly into our unconscious desire to <i>finally</i> initiate 
        that long overdue backlash against the homeless population. So whaddya 
        say? Aren't we all just a little bit <b>tired</b> of looking at their 
        knobby, grubby hands and styrofoam cups? Their poorly inked cardboard 
        signs? We <b>hate</b> being assaulted by gobbly turkey voices on the street, 
        and we <b> just can't stand it</b> when they approach our automobiles 
        and we're idled at a red light. We <b>can</b> thin out their ranks. We 
        <b>can</b> get them out of here. And if homeless people smashing each 
        other's faces with broken bottles isn't extreme enough in this dwarf-tossing 
        <i>Fight Club</i> era, we'll throw some high-school students into the 
        mix, and pay them with Hot Pockets.</p>
      <p><i><img src="add4.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Bumfights</i> 
        weighs in at 57 minutes. It's populated with ghastly, <i>there-but-for-the-grace-of-God-go-you</i> 
        types, plucked fresh off the street like bruised raspberries. The ethical 
        debates which ping-pong back and forth inside the viewer's mind are a 
        weighty side-effect of the video's popularity. Those seeking to proclaim 
        such tapes illegal raise the distressing prospect of banning <i>everything</i> 
        which fails to measure up to a neighborhood's standards of political correctness.</p>
      <p>Independent video stores are more than happy to showcase featurettes 
        like <i>World's Scariest Police Chases</i>, or <i>Girls Gone Wild. </i>Gang 
        rapes, street fights, barroom brawls and hockey matches are happening 
        all around us. They're captured on film each and every day of the week. 
        During the Great Depression, bums earned money by performing in geek shows, 
        swallowing live snakes or biting the heads off chickens. Mentally ill 
        men and women are turned loose from halfway houses at an alarming rate, 
        and many states have ceased financial aid to ex-cons seeking to rebuild 
        their lives. <br>
        <img src="1699687.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"> 
      </p>
      <h1>and so</h1>
      <p>The bums awoke from their stupors, punch-drunk and pissed. They'd been 
        conned into terrible stunts by a handful of overenthusiastic filmmakers 
        and cheap door prizes. In one instance, a single plain cake <b>donut</b> 
        was the winning trophy. Lawsuits were filed in no short order: bums on 
        one side, video producers on the other. Alas, we good people were served 
        only "knuckled" sandwiches, your Honor - and while none among 
        us was hot enough to advance, what we got for our efforts weren't even 
        slightly better rags.</p>
      <p>The defendants (Ryan McPherson, 19; Zachary Bubeck, 25; Daniel J. Tanner, 
        21; and Michael Slyman, 21) pleaded not guilty to charges of battery, 
        illegal fight promotion, conspiracy and soliciting <img src="1691304.jpg" width="120" height="90" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">an 
        assault with deadly force. They claimed to possess a mutually beneficial, 
        professional working relationship with the homeless, arguing that each 
        and every last bum <i>chose</i> to fight. They were willing contractors 
        who signed fanciful disclaimers protecting the filmmakers from important 
        liabilities. The participants were indeed rewarded for their efforts, 
        and they collected their winnings. The defense went on to state they were 
        merely interested in documenting the inherent "humor of homelessness," 
        something which hadn't really been touched upon in mainstream entertainment. 
        When the footage was screened, the judge's jaw dropped and a witness covered 
        his eyes.</p>
      <p>Interviews with the filmmakers laid bare contradicting intentionality. 
        To the BBC, Laticia explains <i>Bumfights</i> "is not done to be 
        shocking. It was done to show an aspect of society that people would otherwise 
        not see." To <i>Wired</i> magazine, he claimed the video <b>was</b> 
        designed to shock: "We're quite aware that some people find it hilarious 
        and some people find it disgusting." The closest they ever got to 
        the truth was during an interview with the <i>Las Vegas Review-Journal:</i> 
        "This project is a means to an end. We want to be feature filmmakers. 
        We're going to cash in and then cash out and go make some movies."</p>
      <p>And then, when grilled by Greta Van Susteren on FOX News in 2002, Ty 
        Beeson asserted that pulling out Rufus's tooth with pliers was <i>actually</i> 
        kind of a favor.</p>
      <p> <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><img src="gretab4.jpg" width="258" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">VAN 
        SUSTEREN:</b> Why didn't you send him to a dentist instead of handing 
        him a pliers?<br>
        <br>
        <b>BEESON:</b> Because he needed it out at that point in time, and sometimes 
        in the streets, it gets rough, and you've got do whatever it takes. That's 
        real life.<br>
        <br>
        <b>VAN SUSTEREN:</b> Lots of people get real-life toothaches, Ty, and 
        they go to the dentist.<br>
        <br>
        <b>BEESON:</b> You're right. A lot of them do, but -- but when you're 
        in the streets and you can't, you've got a -- and you've got a tooth that's 
        bothering you, then you do whatever it takes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>VAN SUSTEREN:</b> 
        How can you call it real when it's staged, when you're paying people to 
        pull their teeth out with pliers and you're paying them to do stunts that 
        are dangerous, to bang their heads against walls? How is that...<br>
        <b><br>
        </b> </font><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>BEESON:</b> 
        Well, how could you say it's staged when that was his real tooth and he

        <b><br>
        VAN SUSTEREN:</b> So what -- you just sat and filmed it. It was just fortuitous 
        that you were there and could film the man pulling his tooth out with 
        a pliers?<br>
        <b><br>
        BEESON:</b> Yeah.<br>
        <b><br>

        VAN SUSTEREN:</b> Fortuitous that you just happened to be there.<br>
        <b><br>
        BEESON:</b> No, we caught it on tape. That's -- we caught it on tape, 
        and that's what happened. I<br>
        mean -- well, it bothered him. He pulled it out. I don't know why we're 
        still talking about<br>
        this..</font></p>
      <p><i><img src="1909428_200X150.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></i>Prosecutors 
        countered that it was wholly inaccurate to describe people without food, 
        shelter or clothing as individuals with choices. Craig Walton, professor 
        of ethics and policy studies at the University of Las Vegas remarked that 
        even the gladiators in the Roman Empire had better conditions.</p>
      <p><i>"I didn't know if this was legal or illegal," </i>one participant 
        said.<i> "But I'd seen Jerry Springer and reality TV shows. I thought, 
        why not be part of what's going on in the world? But my sense right after, 
        I felt like this was something really demoralizing."</i></p>
      <p>Out marched congressman Rep. Earl Blumenauer [D-Ore.] to express his 
        own personal outrage: <i>"I have been appalled at the people who 
        would not just avoid helping but actually are seeking to exploit the homeless." 
        </i>Blumenauer went one step further, making inquiries with the heads 
        of federal agencies in Las Vegas, including the F.B.I, United States Customs 
        authorities, and the Postal Service.</p>
      <p>In January of 2003, a judge decided there was insufficient data to support 
        the most serious criminal charges against the producers of <i>Bumfights</i>. 
        He ruled there was no evidence which demonstrated any of the filmmakers 
        asked homeless people to assault each other. He scorned the production, 
        declaring there was something "abhorrent and morally repugnant in 
        finding joy and profit" through demeaning other human beings, especially 
        homeless alcoholics.</p>
      <p><i><img src="OPTBLING-FIRING2.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></i>In 
        May of the same year, producer Michael Slyman pled guilty to a misdemeanor 
        charge of conspiracy to stage an illegal fight. He was placed on three 
        year's probation and ordered to <i>(ahem)</i> perform volunteer work with 
        the homeless. </p>
      <p>Laticia is a graduate of the University of Southern California film school. 
        Beeson graduated from the film school of University of California, Los 
        Angeles. The two have decided to donate a percentage of the proceeds from 
        the film to a homeless charity, but they "haven't yet decided which 
        one". </p>
<p><i>Bumfights</i> volumes <b>two</b> and <b>three</b> are all but complete. Rumour has it that they won't come out until the remaining "stars" settle (or lose) their civil lawsuits. One of the suits claims that the bum-- err <I>victim</I> was attacked by the "cast" despite refusing to sign a release and declining to participate in the film. <I>Whoops!</I></p>
