<h1>French Fries</h1>

<p>Nobody bothers to ask if you'd like fries with that anymore, because
  these days it's  assumed  you do. In the mid 1990s,
  the world's most ubiquitous upsell line was quietly phased out in favor of
  an even better way to celebrate your preferences. Today's climate
  cordially invites you to participate in <i>supersizing,</i> an American ritual
  which extends one's purchase order to include either more fries, or <b>way,
  way more fries.</b></p>
<p>There is no such thing as a "small order" of fries anymore
  -- fast food chains insist all order hierarchies begin at medium. Nobody wants
  to be accused of dishing out portions so tiny they can't be seen with the naked
  eye, and small bags of fries are typically dwarfed by adjacent 64-ounce
  tower tanks of drinkable soda syrup. It can only be assumed, therefore, that
  "too many fries" is an equally ludicrous conceit.</p>
<p>Marcia Poole of the <i>Sioux City Journal</i> is happy to report that French
  fries get their name not from the country, but the method of peppering and
  preparing the potatoes. They are actually from Belgium -- and for this reason,
  the "f" in "french" need not be capitalized. When one <i>frenches</i> a
  potato, one cuts it into long, narrow strips before cooking it in a tub of
  salted oils. You can also "french" meat, by trimming away the fat and bone,
  leaving behind only lean, lanky shanks. If someone frenches <i>your</i>  meat,
  potatoes, or lean lanky shanks -- get a license plate number and <b>tell a
grown-up.</b> </p>
<p><i><img src="ff_slob.jpg" width="364" height="295" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" ></i>The term "french fries" didn't really enter the American meme until
  1930, after french-fried onions became the talk of the town. You heard it here
  first: <b>onion rings and french fries are two equal and opposite forces,
  battling it out on the world stage for all eternity.</b> Only
  in America, baby! <i>Make way for a new generation! Here's you eating a french
  fry: HOMPTH SLOBBER DUH.  <i>Move it along, old man! </i>Now there's a new
  kid in town! Time for some new-fangled, star-spangled onion rings!
  DOW NOW NOW / GUITAR ROCKIN' / SNOWBOARDIN' / iPODDIN'. </i> In the old-timey
  antiquified black-and-white days gone by, onions were were dipped in flour
  and boiled to a crisp. Other times, they were battered and served with a beer.
  Still other times,
  they were boiled, beer-battered, and served <i>with</i> a flower -- but only
  for <b>garnish,</b>  not
  for eating. Whatever the presentation, to this day french-fried onion rings
  suffer a name which makes little sense: onions cut into circular, concentric
  rings can sometimes be referred to as <i><b>chips</b></i> in faraway sci-fi
  Utopian England or southern Wales -- but they <i>fail to comply</i> one hundred
  percent with the traditional interpretation of french strippers. <i>STRIPS!</i> French
 fried potato strips.</p>
<p><img src="ff_tall.jpg" width="187" height="414" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >During
  the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, France dared to exhibit a level of dissent
  with United States military action. Republicans counterbalanced this disagreement
  by launching the ostensibly humorous and patriotic <i>Freedom
  Fries</i> campaign. Representatives Robert Ney (R - Ohio) and Walter B. Jones
  (R - North Carolina) ordered White House cafeterias to change the name of french
  fries to <i>freedom fries</i> -- an action passed by Congress after a vote.
  Nathalie Loisau, a spokeswoman from the French embassy acknowledged that "we
  are at a very serious moment dealing with very serious issues, and we are not
  focusing on the name you give to potatoes." </p>
<p>French fries remain a point of contention among food historians, but mostly
  it's agreed that President Thomas Jefferson (R - Virginia) was the first president
  to serve french fries in the White House. <b>Maybe even the
  Oval Office!</b> At that point, they were called "pommes
  frites" --  literally, fried pom-poms -- and they were considered staples
  of American cuisine. Historian John Mariani sleuthed that the term "french
  fries" finally made its <img src="ff_machine.jpg" width="165" height="292" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >way into a French food journal sometime around 1858.
  Mariani later died due to complications of the boring.</p>
<p>Should <i>you</i> be able to purchase french fries anywhere, at any time, directly
  on demand? Ladies and gentlemen, that is your <b>God-given right as Americans</b> according
  to a Nevada corporation called <i>Tasty Fries, Inc.</i> Over the course of
  the past ten years, Tasty Fries has spent over $40 million in research and
  development, searching for ways to establish and market an army
  of vending machines capable of dispensing hot, tasty french fries to consumers
  -- in less than ninety seconds.</p>
<p>Inside each vending machine is a streamlined process both elegant and genius:
  a Willy Wonka wonderland of pure imagination. First, a clump of Nestle-brand
  Potato Product gets re-hydrated with purified water under an ultraviolet lamp.
  From there, the mushy semi-solid potato compost can be squeezed through a wire
  grid, rendering exactly 32 individual fry-like <i>parallelepipeds</i> (extruded
  rectangles).</p>
<p align=center><img src="ff_tasty.jpg" width="740" height="212" vspace="5" ></p>
<p>Then they're lowered basket-wise,
  into a miniature cooking chamber containing clean, preheated, cholesterol-free
  oil. After cooking, they're dispensed into a cup,  with ketchup
  and salt available upon request. Every half hour, the machine performs a self-sanitizing
  operation with water <img src="ff_nose.jpg" width="350" height="263" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >reaching temperatures of 190 degrees, and the used oil
is sold to a recycling company. Talk about savory and delicious! </p>
<p>The Tasty Fries machines attempted to establish and secure territory wherever
  fries made the most sense: high schools, airports, bus and train stations.
  They went public, issuing millions of dollars' worth of stock. In
  1994, the Tasty Fries board of directors invited Edward Kelly, the owner of
  a machine design subcontracting company to witness the Tasty Fries magic. The
  machine produced what Kelly could only describe as "the most disgusting potato
  product" he'd ever seen. He refused to eat anything that plopped like a prom-toilet
  abortion from a Tasty Fries dispensary, and in a written evaluation he suggested
  the company promptly abandon their idea.</p>
<p>The board of directors responded by making Mr. Kelly the CEO of Tasty Fries,
  Inc. -- in the hopes he could architect a better machine. Shortly thereafter,
  the company entered a period of sharp decline, brought about by partner-related
  investment scandals and the failure to turn a profit or place even a single
  vending machine into the marketplace. Judge Vice Chancellor Stephen Lamb expressed
  strong <img src="ff_coil.jpg" width="267" height="338" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >criticism of the company, citing numerous Tasty Fries press releases
  as "overly optimistic, if not outright misleading". He went on to describe
  the Tasty Fries as a sham venture "little more than a vehicle to raise money
  from gullible investors". </p>
<p>During the very first business quarter of 2006, a cascading blitzkrieg of
  simultaneous snack food scandals threatened to deep-fry the <a href="/library/crime/corporate/mcdonalds/">McDonald's</a> restaurant
  corporation. In January, a "labeling rule" enacted by the Food and Drug Administration
  required the entire packaged food industry to report <i>all</i> common allergen
  ingredients in
  an easily-accessible public forum. Translation: if people might be <b>deathly
  allergic</b> to
something in your product, now's your chance to let 'em know.</p>
<p>This ruling forced McDonald's to make February disclosures on
  its website that their french fry recipe contained -- among other things like
  partially hydrogenated soybean oil and dextrose <a href="/library/medicine/corn/">corn</a> <a href="/library/crime/drugs/sugar/">sugar</a> -- something called <b>gluten,</b> a
  protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Gluten is used by McDonald's on
  a massive scale, primarily as a flavoring agent but also as a key ingredient
  in its <b>french fry cooking oil. </b>Stockholders panicked. It was <a href="/library/crime/corporate/enron/">Enron</a>
  all over again, if Enron was a big tall glutinous french fry, stomping across
  America like King Kong, squirting ketchup on people and tossing
  them around like rag dolls. </p>
<p><img src="ff_costume.jpg" width="289" height="332" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >The language of the french fry disclosure on McDonald's' website 
  was structured innocently enough: "contains
  wheat and milk ingredients" -- but that was all it took for 
  citizens like Debra Moffatt of Cook County, Illinois to hire the Chicago law
  firm of Dale and Pakenas. Together,
  they filed a suit charging the restaurant giant of consumer fraud, seeking
  class-action status and unspecified damages. Moffatt and her two children suffer
  from <b>celiac disease,</b> which interferes
  with the absorption of nutrients and is only triggered by ingesting gluten.
  Mark and Theresa Chimiak of Jupiter, Florida filed a lawsuit as well, claiming
  their gluten-intolerant 5-year-old daughter Annalise became seriously ill
  after eating McDonald's fries.</p>
<p>Then another Florida family joined in: David
  and Cherilyn Levy of Fort Lauderdale. They allowed their five-year-old daughter
  Sydni to eat McDonald's french fries twice a week, primarily because the corporation
  had already gone on record to promote their fries as gluten-free. Sydni's celiac
  reactions began to exacerbate the symptons of her <a href="/library/medicine/epidemics/autism/">autism</a>, and the Levy lawsuit
  seeks more than $5 million. Within days, dozens more vegans, vegetarians, individuals
  with low self-esteem and those just looking to hop aboard the handout bandwagon
  were also suing McDonald's. </p>
<p>Celiac disease affects 1 in 133 Americans. Symptoms certainly include classic,
  best-of favorites like <a href="/library/medicine/bodily-functions/shitting/diarrhea/">diarrhea</a>, weight loss and malnutrition -- but also isolated
  nutrient deficiencies which accumulate over time, making the sufferer less
  immune to toxins. And it's by no means just for poor white trash anymore: recent
  celiac studies show the disease's increasing tolerance for Hispanics, Blacks
and Asians.</p>
<p>Sufferers often waste <b>years</b> of their lives getting misdiagnosed
  for their mysterious stomach cramps and spluttery toilet splurts. A common
  assumption is that you've got cancer, or Leukemi<img src="ff_jack.jpg" width="373" height="228" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >a,
  or nonexistent ulcers consistent with Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Victims can
  be subjected to many unnecessary or expensive procedures -- including blood
  tests, biopsies, ultrasound and CAT scans, thyroid exams, and probing treatments
  for urinary tract infections or lurking parasites. Ultimately, the only acceptable
  treatment for celiac disease is a strict, 100% adherence to a gluten-free diet <b>for
  life.</b> This
  means eliminating wheat, rye, oats, barley, dairy products, soy, and eggs. </p>
<p>In the midst of this crisis, in February of 2006, 42-year-old Lora Davis of
  Gaston County, North Carolina, claimed to have found <b>smeared blood</b> inside
  her box of french fries.</p>
<p>Davis says she bought a Happy Meal at the drive-through window of a Gastonia
  McDonald's in November 2004, and then went back to her office for lunch. When
  she found the blood, she called the restaurant and spoke with an apologetic
  assistant regional manager -- who confirmed that the blood came from an employee
  with a cut.</p>
<p>"At first, I felt disbelief," Davis said. "Then fear. I get
  sick when I think about it." </p>
<p><img src="ff_pants.jpg" width="216" height="345" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >She went straight to her doctor for an <a href="/library/culture/sesame-street/kami/">AIDS</a> test and a check for other infectious
  diseases -- under the impression that McDonald's would pay for her medical
  bills. When she didn't hear back from the company for several months, she filed
  a $10,000 lawsuit and stopped eating out for several months.</p>
<p>Gaston County health inspector John Carpenter said he spoke to the McDonald's
  manager, who confirmed Davis' account of the incident. Carpenter gave him a
  lecture about handling future situations in which a preparer of food has cuts
  on his fingers or hands. An attorney for Davis says all attempts to reach an
  out-of-court settlement have been fruitless -- and McDonald's isn't commenting
  because the claim is pending. Meanwhile across town, an emergency blood transfusion
  failed after an errant french fry was found lodged in the patient's heart.</p>
<p><b>Hey -- do these french fry pants make me look fat? </b>You bet they do.
  The blood and gluten scandals arose only a few months after McDonald's
  had <i>already</i> come
  forward to acknowledge that their french fries contained a <i>third</i> more
  fat than previously admitted, prompting equal and opposite lawsuits from citizenry
  around the nation, sometimes in excess of $10 million. Will this prosecution
  never end? </p>
<p>In
  school breakfast and lunch programs, french fries are demonstrably more popular
  than hamburgers and slices of pizza combined. <img src="ff_ladies.jpg" width="386" height="269" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Morning and afternoon
  menus across America need only leverage the<i> power of the potato</i> to boost
  cafeteria sales and help our plumpity-plump pre-teens grow even plumpitier. </p>
<p>In
  your face, fruit cup! These days, junior high school students enjoy an endless
  parade of all-you-can-eat buffet rivaling those found in <a href="/library/travel/cities/las-vegas/">Las Vegas</a> casinos.
  Sausage links with gravy, french toast sticks, tacos, breakfast burritos, graham
  cracker marshmallow s'mores, double-fudge brownies, scrambled eggs, pork patties,
  tater tots, jelly donuts, sticky cinnamon rolls, strawberry cheesecake, barbecued
  ribs, buttermilk biscuits, beef and cheese quesadillas, potato rounds, double-battered
  corn dogs, parmesan-baked macaroni and cheese -- and two phat-ass scoops of
  Rocky Road devil's food gumball ice cream with vanilla-cinnamon whipped cream
  pie for dessert! So for the love of god, people: <b>save room
  for the french fries.</b> Pace yourself, it's not a marathon. And
  make some noise for all the dedicated cafeteria ladies out there. They work
  hard and they play hard.</p>
