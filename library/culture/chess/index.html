<h1>Chess</h1>

<p>When a nagging child is overheard arguing his case for mom or dad to buy
  him a new video game, one particularly desperate <a href="/library/conspiracy/kid-marketing/">talking point</a> comes up again
  and again: <i>this
  will totally improve my hand-eye coordination. </i>If you're a parent
  who feels like enrolling your gifted child into some kind of chess club because
  it seems like a rewarding alternative to video games,
   consider the observations of Reuben Fine, psychoanalyst and author of <i>The
  Psychology of the Chess Player</i> originally
  published in 1956:<br >
  <br >
  <i>"The profuse phallic symbolism of chess provides some fantasy gratification
of the homosexual wish, particularly the desire for mutual masturbation."</i></p>
<p>Chess
  is a hopelessly trivial human enterprise, which can't help your child think "several
  moves in advance" about difficult scenarios in the real world. It certainly
  won't get him off the Internet long enough to get laid. Playing chess for hours
  at a time only helps you play <i><b>better</b></i> chess for hours at a time -- and
  that's all it will ever do. Most people genuinely believe that chess is a perfect,
  flawless game incapable of creating controversy -- a hobbyist pursuit so ultimately
  pure and clean that no evil thoughts could ever rise from the board. In truth,
  most of us are in it for the money.</p>
<p><img src="ch_powell2.jpg" width="393" height="406" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" >On
  busy urban avenues like Market Street in <a href="/library/travel/cities/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a>, gentlemen (and the
  occasional lady) engage themselves in a form of betting chess known as <b>slash
  and trash.</b> A group of these
  individuals runs the full gamut from Soviet-bloc and Asian immigrants to fresh-faced
  college students, homeless people and manic depressives. The betting chess
  environment is very much a pay to play operation:
anywhere from one to five dollars buys you a seat at the table.</p>
<p>If you fancy yourself a slash player, you'll need the right tools. For God
  sakes, throw your plastic <a href="/library/culture/the-simpsons/">Simpsons</a> chess set with multicolored Bart
  pawns in the trash. Nobody likes to push weirdly-weighted ivory carvings
   around a miniature marblized re-telling of <i>Alien vs. Predator</i>.
  Even shiny wooden fold-out boards and elegant pieces sculpted from oak or walnut
  feel a little absurd. When pieces roll off the
  table and fall three feet to the concrete sidewalk, you don't want to start
  crying when your horsey's head snaps off. You will forever be referred to as
  a <b>fish,</b> an
  unpleasant nickname for a prison pussy punk who has no idea what
  he's gotten himself into. </p>
<p>Instead, consider your environment: you're
  typically outdoors in windy weather or inside a smoky coffee shop in the University
  district. You want a set of chess pieces which can be endlessly <img src="ch_chair.jpg" width="448" height="299" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >gang
  banged
  around like a woman -- grabbed by the hair and slammed down <i>real hard</i> on
  a particular square. Like semi-decent sex, traditional <b>blitz</b> games
  need last no longer than two minutes. The slamming rhythm is very important
  to the street hustlers known as <i>sharks</i>.
  The
  more aggressively a shark can bang a piece down on a square, the more directly
  he's insinuating that the game already belongs to him. The opposite technique
  can be equally effective: <i>pawn
  pushers</i> delight
  in using their forefingers to nudge a piece <i>slllllowly</i> about the board
  -- in excruciatingly small, pixel-sized increments. Both the shark and the
  pawn pusher are engaged in a school of chess strategy which delights in <b>playing
  the man, not the board.</b> </p>
<p>Get a standard, regulation <b>chess
  mat</b> in
  one of the two classic Apple monochrome monitor color schemes: green or amber.
  This soft, rubbery rectangle has lowercase letters spanning from <b>a</b> to <b>h</b> along
  one edge, and numbers running from <b>1</b> to <b>8</b> across the ranks. <img src="ch_cash.jpg" width="354" height="283" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >It's
  best kept rolled in a tightly-bound
  tube which sticks up out of your backpack so everyone on the bus can see it
  -- or awkwardly folded with haphazard crinkles and creases so it bends and
  peaks all over the place during game play. Your chess mat should also be <b>dirty</b> --
  filthy dirty in fact, totally banged up, and visibly battle-scarred. Slash
  players take a special pride in extinguishing their cigarettes directly on
  the square you were just checkmated, so after a few games your chess mat 
becomes a living, breathing document of your many failures.</p>
<p>You will also need a two-dial chess clock. Yes, it will cost you about sixty
  dollars -- but this instrument is mandatory, as it limits a game a predetermined
  amount of time and prevents your opponent from dawdling.
  You don't want a game to last forever. </p>
<p>Perhaps nobody's been more scammified by chess -- mentally or
  physically -- than former World Champion Bobby Fischer, arguably the most
  brilliant player in history. Here's a guy who started in 1949, as a six-year-old
  hanging out at the Brooklyn Chess Club. As a child, he appeared so completely
  "into" the game that his mom <img src="ch_fischer.jpg" width="420" height="307" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >
  eventually hauled him off to the Children's Psychiatric Division of the Brooklyn
  Jewish Hospital. The doctor told mom to chillax. <i>Leave him alone, let the boy
  play already.</i> At age 14, he became Champion of the United States.</p>
<p>Bobby would grow increasingly paranoid over the years, fearful of untrustworthy
  adults and other individuals who might trick him into giving away his secrets.
  At the height of the Cold War, <a href="/library/bio/usa/henry-kissinger/">Henry Kissinger</a> personally pleaded with Fischer
  to try defeating the Soviets in chess during a season of high-stakes tournament
  games more politically charged than the Olympics. His opponent, Boris Spassky,
  grew visibly annoyed when Fischer objected to nearly every aspect of the gaming
  environment. The thermostat in the auditorium, Fischer claimed, was deliberately
  cold in an attempt to hinder his performance. The lights were too bright, the
  cameras too loud and way too close. The size of the audience was intended to
  throw him off game. The <img src="ch_after.jpg" width="300" height="371" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left">
  amount of the prize money wasn't nearly worth his trouble. The color of the
  chess board was off-putting. <i>The KGB is spraying poison on my chair,
  onto my food,</i> etcetera. Despite these tactics -- or perhaps because of
  them -- Fischer later emerged from that tournament victorious. </p>
<p>Fischer ultimately become famous for other things, including a blue streak
  of outspoken anti-Semitism which likely cost him more than a few worldwide
  fans and allies. "There are too many Jews in chess", Fischer would say in 1962.
  "They seem to have taken away the class from the game. They don't seem to dress
  so nicely, you know. That's what I don't like". In 1972, he remarked that America
  was totally under the control of the Jews. </p>
<p>On <a href="/library/crime/terrorism/september_11/">September 11</a>, 2001, Fischer praised the terrorist attacks in
  New York as "wonderful", and hoped it would encourage America to
  imprison the Jews. Then he called for their execution by the hundreds of thousands.
  When Fischer tried to leave Japan with an invalid U.S. passport, he landed
  himself in a Japanese prison for nine months.</p>
<p><img src="ch_mug.jpg" width="117" height="128" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >If
  only we could have a civilized, family-friendly discussion about chess without
  having to bring up allegations of <b>child molestation.</b> On February
  7, 2006, 51-year-old Senior Master Robert M. Snyder was ordered
  to stand trial on charges he molested three of his prized male pupils, each
  under the age of 15. One of the boys alleged that
  after attending a weekend chess camp in June of 2005, he'd slept in Snyder's
  bedroom without pajama bottoms. Another boy claimed that Snyder "touched him
  inappropriately", according to the Rocky Mountain News -- and "tickled him
  before they went out to lunch".  Two of the boys insinuated that Snyder performed
  oral sex on them, while a third suggested that Snyder put his hands down his
  pants. <img src="ch_celebs.jpg" width="316" height="357" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left"></p>
<p>Snyder,
  the founder of <i>Chess for Juniors,</i> has taken his students to
  every National Junior High School Championship since 1986, and every National
  Elementary School Championship since 1989. He received the 1998 National Chess
  Educator of the Year Award at the All America Cup National Scholastic Championships.</p>
<p>He's
  also the chess mentor of actor/rapper Will Smith, who started taking lessons
  in March 1998 while filming <i>Enemy of the State.</i> Actor Nicolas Cage,
  who believes chess is a good activity for kids, enrolled his son Weston in
  Snyder's class in 1999. Snyder was acquitted of similar child molestation charges
  more than twenty years ago in California. Possibly he opened with the Sicilian
  Nambla gambit, who knows. </p>
<p>Chess scams are everywhere -- even
  on the Internet, thanks to the hundreds of spammers headquartered safely in
  Nigeria. Fraudulent emails are frequently pitched from the "Nigerian Chess Trainers Committee" directly
  to individuals on bulk email lists who have demonstrated an interest
  in the game at least once. Haven't you heard? Nigeria is actively recruiting
chess teachers: </p>
<p> <img src="ch_dude.jpg" width="280" height="414" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" ><i>"The
    welfare of the chess trainers would be catered for by NCTC and their flight
    tickets to Nigeria would be arranged by the Nigerian Embassy. The trainers
    would be lodged in Sheraton hotels Lagos for their two week stay and would
    each be paid $8000. After this two weeks, any trainer who decides he wants
    to stay would still be catered for by NCTC. He or she would be moved to his
    or her own apartment, paid $12000 monthly and given citizenship."</i></p>
<p>Interested? Great. They need $980.00 to file your paperwork. There's no such
  thing as the NCTC, but the <i>World Chess Federation</i> (WCF)
  and the <i>Federation
    Internationale des Echecs</i>  (FIDE) are the same thing: a singular, authoritative
  entity governing the premiere list of the world's top-rated professional competitors
and ranked master players.</p>
<p>Even  the official point-assignment method which ranks and
  rates professional players competing in tournaments has always felt like kind
  of scam, because it's essentially a <i>mathematical averaging system</i> based
  on <b>paired
  comparisons.</b> One person alone cannot ever say how strong he is,
  unless he's played many different people -- all of whom, ostensibly, have
  competed against an adequate sampling of other players -- and so on, and so
  forth. The system which most closely approaches universal approval was developed
  in 1959 by Arpad Emre Elo, a physics professor at the University of Chicago. </p>
<p><img src="ch_elo.jpg" width="300" height="401" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >In an article for the 1962 issue of <i>Chess Life,</i> professor Elo came
  up with analogy meant to describe why measuring the "strength" of a chess player
  is so tedious and arbitrary.  "Often
  people who are not familiar with the nature and limitations of statistical
  methods tend to expect too much of the rating system. Ratings provide merely
  a comparison of performances, no more and no less. The measurement of the performance
  of an individual is always made relative to the performance of his competitors
  -- and both the performance of the player <i>and</i> of his opponents are subject
  to much the same random fluctuations. The measurement of the rating of an individual
  might well be compared with the measurement of the position of a cork bobbing
  up and down on the surface of agitated water with a yard stick tied to a rope
and which is swaying in the wind."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, players  whose averages hover around <b>2200</b> can be considered <i>Candidate
    Masters</i>. With an average between <b>2400</b> and <b>2499,</b> you
  can be an <i>International
  Master</i>.
  <b>2500</b> and above will earn you the status of <i>International Grandmaster</i> --
  the second-highest title awarded to competitive chess players, and a title
  which you get to keep for life. The only thing higher than an International
  Grandmaster is of course a <i>World Champion.</i></p>
<p><img src="ch_xmen.jpg" width="426" height="272" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Every
  so often, Hollywood happily shits out another movie featuring chess as one
  of its lesser themes. Chess boards are commonly invoked when hacky scriptwriters
  can't architect more visually appealing metaphors for two opposing forces of
  good and evil led by individuals with colliding intellects. Snippets of dialog
  between characters engaged in a "battle of wills" are often as trite as they
  are terse, with characters delivering stinging quips followed by the word "check".
  Examples include <i>Independence Day, Se7en, CopyCat, Hackers, Mr. Holland's
  Opus, Phenomenon, The Interpreter, Dawn of the Dead, Pearl Harbor, The Thomas
  Crown Affair, The Seventh Seal, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,</i> and
  the scatterbrained last season of <i>Twin Peaks,</i> to name but a few. Other
  times, a more intimate cinematic portrait will focus on the journey of an Emotionally
  Sensitive Young Person as he or she begins to demonstrate an Extraordinary
  Level of Skill with the game -- leading inevitably to a study of whatever Dramatic
  Narrative Consequences accompany such a gift. <i>Searching for Bobby Fischer</i> and <i>Little
Man Tate</i> are two such examples. </p>
<p><img src="ch_fresh.jpg" width="431" height="280" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left"> If that sounds like exactly the kind of nonsense you've learned to avoid at
  the movies,  consider renting instead the brilliant <i><b>Fresh</b> </i>starring
  Sean Nelson, directed by Boaz Yakin in 1994. It's a violent, exciting ghetto
  thriller which slowly and quietly unfolds into a plot of astounding complexity
  -- and the only "chess
  film" ever made which follows a child drug dealer and his prostitute sister
  on their rounds through the hood. Rated 'R' for Intense Realistic Depiction
  of Urban Violence, Drug Content, Pervasive Language and Sexuality. </p>
<p> Or, instead of wasting your whole life caring about chess, consider <b>saving
  the game</b> as
  a hobby for when you're old and feeble. In the old folks home, daily chess
  games with Grandpa Simpson will help keep what's left of your mental condition
  in tip-top shape as you age, reducing the risk of brain diseases like Alzheimer's
  and Parkinsons. The mental decline which goes along with old age can be traced
  to "altered connections" between brain cells, according to Elizabeth Edgerly,
  a brain expert at the Alzheimer's A<img src="ch_spock.jpg" width="418" height="314" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >ssociation.
  Chess is only one option for senior citizens -- experts are now saying that
  activities which involve a significant
  <b>mental challenge</b> are better for the brain than those which are routine.
  Memorizing a complicated set of dance steps, for instance, instead of just
  zoning out your stationary bike.</p>
<p> Successful agers are typically mentally active people. Playing chess accomplishes
  a number of tasks vital to restoring pathways in the brain. During game play,
  monitoring the direction and placement of 32 individual pieces on a checkerboard
  grid sharpens short-term memory. Developing strategies for capturing your opponent's
  pieces -- however half-assed -- strengthens  long-term memory. The act
  of putting yourself in your opponents' position to consider how he might react
  to <i>your</i> strategies is also key. <b>Role reversal</b> serves to reinforce
  important realities about boundaries. It may sound like mutual masturbation,
  but the concept of <i>where self begins and others end</i> is an important
  skill which erodes during the onset of Alzheimer's. It's also a characteristic
  which continues to elude increasingly obsessive human players as they grow
  old and die without much to show for themselves.</p>
