<h1>Tetris</h1>
<p><b>Tetris</b> is a computer game involving a sequence of falling <i>tetromino</i> 
  pieces which the user must first revolve into a desired position and subsequently 
  pack into an increasingly dense rectangular array.</p>
<p>As gameplay progresses, filled horizontal rows on the gameboard are cleared, 
  allowing pieces above that row to drop by the height of one square. Gameplay 
  stops when the next piece can no longer successfully enter the congested playing 
  field.</p>
<p>Typically <i>Tetris</i> players lose due to a series of poor judgement calls 
  or because the speed of the game increases at higher levels -- but mathematicians 

  around the world will insist that even a supercomputer masturbating itself with 
  a game of extraordinarily slow solitaire Tetris will eventually lose due to 
  the odd number of columns, the S-and Z-shaped pieces forcing empty squares in 
  the grid, and the probability of long-term inequality in the stack sizes. The 
  incremental escalation of the puzzle-piece gameplay is also a good metaphor 
  for the dozens of quarreling software entities who tried to seize control of 
  the Tetris empire when it first emerged, and a not-so-bad way to frame the <b>double 
  murder-suicide </b> eventually carried out by the man responsible for introducing 
  the game to the free world.</p>
<p><img src="gameboy-1.jpg" width="200" height="145" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Tetris 
  was developed in the <a href="/library/history/countries/soviet-union/">Soviet Union</a>, circa 1985-6, by Alexey Pajitnov, Dima Pavlovsky, 
  and Vadim Gerasimov. Pajitnov and Pavlovsky were computer engineers at the Computer 
  Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences, while Gerasimov was a sixteen year 
  old high school student who enjoyed writing directory encryption programs for 
  MS DOS. Originally a spinoff of the ancient Roman puzzle <i>Pentamino</i>, the 
  boys called their game <i><img src="tetris-4.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Genetic 
  Engineering</i> and the play was vastly different: pieces were moved about the 
  screen with cursor keys instead of being driven by gravity -- but Alexey came 
  to insist the pieces fall from above, "into a glass, or bucket". As 
  they developed the game, they had trouble finishing even the simplest of prototypes. 
  The testing process was so addictive it seemed like they <i>never</i> had time 
  to polish the code. They were indeed enthusiastic about developing a series 
  of cheap and tawdry warez, but <b>selling</b> the fruits of their labors would 
  prove difficult -- if not impossible -- due to strict commerce, distribution, 
  and industry regulations imposed on all citizens of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>At the time, private businesses in the Soviet Union were illegal. The concept 
  of intellectual property had not yet evolved, and individuals were prohibited 
  from making privatized business arrangements involving abstract collateral like 
  "computer software". Furthermore, the computer center at the Russian 
  Academy of Sciences owned everything they made, since the code was written on 
  the Computer Center's equipment and the Academy's time. Junior programmer Gerasimov 
  -- working on Tetris purely for entertainment-- could never be formally hired 
  by a Soviet government organization because at the time, he was underage.</p>
<p><img src="alexey.jpg" width="396" height="188" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Alexey's 
  efforts to market Tetris himself altogether failed until he discussed the matter 
  with Vladimir Pokhilko, a clinical psychologist and longtime friend. Vladimir 
  had been experimenting with using puzzles as psychological tests, and he immediately 
  saw that Tetris would have mass appeal. It <i>had</i> to be sold, it was the 
  greatest thing Russia had unleashed since chess.</p>
<p>"The main part is visual insight," Alexey lectured at a conference. "You make your visual decision and it happens almost immediately. Insight means emotion: small, but many of them, every two, three seconds. The second mechanism is unfinished action. Tetris has many unfinished actions which force you to continue and make it very addictive. The third is automatization: in a couple of hours, the activity becomes automatic, a habit, a motivation to repeat."</p>
<p>The two men began working together: they gave copies away to friends and leaked 
  the game outside the country in a secretive end-run around Soviet politics. 
  Tetris became the full-on focus of Alexey's time, and the game slowly evolved 
  <img src="srink.jpg" width="300" height="426" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">from 
  a 4-color 320x200 text grid into the two-player graphical version we know today, 
  complete with sound and music based on classical Russian folk songs ripped from 
  the public domain. Alexey's decision to abandon all other gaming projects <i>except</i> 
  Tetris was an upsetting blow to fellow programmer Dmitry, and it was here that 
  the initial team of young programmers officially dissolved.</p>
<p>A few months after Tetris started sneaking around the world, Robert Stein, 
  CEO of the British software company Andromeda was vacationing in Budapest. He 
  first laid eyes on the Apple II and Commodore-64 versions of Tetris -- but like 
  an elite, bloodthirsty software pirate, he started selling versions to companies 
  around the world (including Mirrorsoft U.K. and Spectrum Holobyte in the United 
  States) without first securing legal rights to the game by going through the 
  proper channels. Specifically, he failed to consult with the Russian ministry 
  for import and export of software and hardware. By November, Stein's activities 
  had been discovered by the Russian programmers, who now had big, angry choices 
  to make. Do they keep quiet? Will they need a lawyer? Should they get the government 
  involved?</p>
<p> <img src="snap0261.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Before 
  anyone could make a move, Stein further upped the ante: he wired a contract 
  for the rights to <i>Tetris</i> directly to the Academy itself, then flew to 
  Moscow to sign the contract. Fortunately or unfortunately, the meeting did not 
  go well: the Academy really had no idea who he was or what he was talking about. 
  <i>Da stacken der blockenfalls? </i>Officials met the eager clicking of his 
  ballpoint pen with caution and obstinance. Meanwhile, the IBM PC version of 
  Tetris released by Spectrum Holobyte and Mirrorsoft were causing a sensation. 
  "Obscenely addictive," raved the reviews. The graphics were filled 
  with Russian themes -- battle tanks, Red Square, space missions -- and Tetris 
  was hailed as the first video game from behind the Iron Curtain. </p>
<p><img src="duh.jpg" width="150" height="184" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><img src="coin.jpg" width="250" height="461" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">In 
  less than a few months, Spectrum Holobyte contacted Alexey directly, expressing 
  an interest in securing the <i>genuine</i> rights to a Tetris license. What 
  resulted was catastrophic international situation pushing the programmers, a 
  global software industry and everybody's lawyers toward a brand new entity: 
  ELORG (Elektronorgtechnica), the Russian ministry for the import and export 
  of software. It would now be up to the whims of one man, Alexander Alexinko 
  of the Soviet government to determine where Tetris would be sold, and to whom 
  the rights could be delineated. Alexinko had been briefed by a CBC Evening News 
  interview with Pajitnov -- the <i>real</i> creator of Tetris -- and was able 
  to rule that Stein had been selling rights to a product he never owned.</p>
<p><img src="tetris-1.jpg" width="200" height="245" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">By 
  1989, over a dozen software companies were knee-deep in Tetrisgate. Mirrorsoft 
  and Spectrum Holobyte had already sub-licensed their rights to the game, effectively 
  enabling Bullet-Proof Software (sub-licensed by Spectrum Holobyte) and Atari 
  Games (sub-licensed by Mirrorsoft) to begin fighting over rights to Tetris in 
  Japan, even as Nintendo of America planned to make Tetris packs. Tengen, Blue 
  Planet Software, and Sony entered the ring as well -- effectively leaving the 
  original Tetris programmers in the cold.</p>
<p>In an interview with the <i>San Francisco Examiner</i>, Pajitnov acknowledged that he had acquiesced to Soviet demands 
to sign over the rights to Tetris because he feared reprisals. "I would have been 
in prison for sure had I gone directly to Nintendo," Pajitnov said. "I would have 
had to be a dissident and possibly be cheated for everything anyway. So it wasn't 
worth it." During the 10 years the Soviet government brokered deals with Nintendo, 
Atari and other video-game makers, Pajitnov lost an estimated $40 million in royalties.</p><p>In 1996, 
the ELORG restrictions in the Soviet Union expired, and Tetris rights reverted to Pajitnov, 
who had since immigrated to the United States with psychologist friend Pokhilko. Together they launched AnimaTek International Inc., a 
software  company specializing in computer-generated terrains and characters 
for the gaming industry. Almost immediately, the company
began experiencing difficulties brought on by  economic upheaval in Russia, 
where 70 of AnimaTek's 82 employees were stationed, and he was forced to  mortgage his home for $386,000. Flustered, Pokhilko went on tour last  to drum up support in hopes of landing $10 million in capital for an e-commerce firm.</p>
<p><img src="blood.jpg" width="496" height="360" align="right">When that 
  didn't work, on the night of September 22, 1998, Pokhilko struck his wife Elena 
  in the head over a dozen times with a hammer, and <a href="/library/bio/crime/criminals/darlie-routier/">stabbed her</a> repeatedly. Then 
  he stabbed his twelve year old son Peter with a long hunting knife nearly thirty 
  times as he lay sleeping. Finally, Pokhilko stabbed himself in the throat. All 
  three bodies were discovered by a family friend, who immediately called the 
  police. Responding officers found Pokhilko face down, the knife still in his 
  hand. Nearby, police located a terse <a href="/library/death/suicide/suicide-notes/">suicide note</a>, which read:</p>
<p>I'VE BEEN EATEN ALIVE.<br><br>VLADIMIR.</p><p>JUST REMEMBER THAT I AM EXIST<br><br>THE DAVIL.</p><p>The Palo Alto police department, with  assistance from the <a href="/library/conspiracy/fbi/">FBI</a>, had no trouble 
  fitting the pieces together. 

 "There are different interpretations of what the note means," announced Sergeant Scott Wong. "But any interpretation of the person writing the note is that they were under some stress."</p><p>Tetris is the largest selling and most recognized global brand in the history 
  of interactive gaming software. It can be found on more than 60 platforms -- 
  including cell phones, ATM machines in eastern countries, and handheld personal digital assistants. In 2004, it was estimated that over eighty million Tetris units had been 
  sold.</p></p>
