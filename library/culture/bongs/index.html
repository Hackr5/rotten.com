<h1>Bongs </h1>

<p><b><i>Shhh!</i></b> Jesus Christ dude, they're called <b>water pipes</b> and
  they're used for smoking <b>tobacco</b> or other legal herbal blends. Can't
  you read the sign? If the clerk hears us making <i>any references</i> to
  bongs, drugs, <a href="/library/crime/drugs/marijuana/">marijuana</a>, or unlawful substances -- we'll both get thrown out!
  Just keep your mouth shut and follow my lead. </p>
<p>Water pipe shops are commonly referred to as <b>head shops</b> by the tie-dye
  hippie types over forty who still lurk among us in sleepy towns like Portland,
  Oregon and Davenport, California. The term "head
  shop" communicates  the idea of a store selling things which are "good
  for one's head" --
  the term being a 1960s generational corruption of the word "pothead".
  Outside of a head shop, water pipes are indeed called <b>bongs,</b> so nicknamed
after the Thai word <i>baung: </i>a snapped-off section of hollow bamboo
which doubles as a you-know-what. </p>
<p><img src="bh_dongbong.jpg" width="368" height="315" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >Just
  gaze upwards over yonder counter top and look at all the funny bongs. So many
  styles and varieties! Why would you ever need one with multiple chambers? Hey,
  that one looks like the <i>Starship Enterprise!</i> <b>Which one is right
  for you?</b> They're
  not all glass, of course. Some are plastic. Others are wooden, or painted ceramic
with a light glaze of enamel. There are two distinct types of bong designs: those
  crafted after Grateful Dead hippie shit, invoking imagery of skulls, the pot
  leaf, or dancing bears -- and <b>everything else.</b> What's important is that
  you understand what a bong is specifically designed for: it <i>cools
    the smoke</i> before
  it hits your lungs, enabling you to efficiently consume <i>larger buffers</i> of
  your product while minimizing the peer group humiliation which comes from coughing
  loudly, choking, and being a complete loser. </p>
<p>The critics agree: smoking [legal tobacco products and herbal blends] out
  of a <a href="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/">glass</a> bong provides a smoother, richer smoking experience. Bongs constructed
  from ceramic or plastic run the risk of scratching, burning, melting ever so
  slightly, or emitting fumes which can lead to asthma or respiratory-related
  illnesses. </p>
<p><img src="bh_glass.jpg" width="260" height="350" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Unless a bong was clearly assembled from uniform, prefabricated parts like
  Pyrex beakers or rubber cork stoppers, chances are it was lovingly crafted <b>by
    hand.</b> Today's
  most sought-after
  manufacturers are professional artisans or students of chemistry,
  physics, and material engineering. A bong starts its life as a tiny droplet
  of molten glass -- colored or clear -- pulled from a <i>crucible furnace</i> which
  approaches 2800 degrees Fahrenheit. The key ingredients in bong glass are red-hot
  silica sand, lime (calcium hydroxide), sodium bicarbonate, and recyclable
  shards of other glass. A single droplet has the viscosity of <a href="/library/crime/drugs/sugar/">honey</a>,
  and exists in a slow-flowing state known to students of computational fluid
  dynamics as <b>supercooled.</b></p>
<p>The bong maker <i>(psst: they prefer to be called <b>glass blowers</b>)</i> extracts
  and gathers this droplet onto a hollow rod, where it can be shaped, extruded,
  sculpted and beveled with a propane torch. With gentle clockwise and counterclockwise
  rotations, the rod is spun back and forth, occasionally angled with deliberate
  tilts up and down so the "blob" assumes the rough shape of a cylinder. This
  technique is the same for glass pipes as it is for bongs -- and different metal
  instruments resembling those found in a blacksmith's shop can be used to add
  decoration or enhance detail while the glass is further trained.</p>
<p>Hollow rods  also double as a <b>blowpipes:</b> air is forced through the
  tube (by the artisan's lungs or a set of accordion billows) so the molten
  glass can expand in size and shape like a balloon. <img src="bh_dressup.jpg" width="300" height="301" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />Watching a bong evolve from
  a glowing, amber tadpole is a <b>magical process.</b> Look, there's the water
  chamber! There's the stem! I see where the carb is gonna be! He's sprinkling
   scraps of plastic in the glass so when the final design melts together
  it'll all be infused with multicolored rivers and swirls! <i>Dude, I totally remember
  Shrinky Dinks. </i></p>
<p>If the bong starts cooling more quickly than it can be sculpted, the
  artisan stashes what he's got right in the <b>glory hole,</b> a
  side compartment of the blasting window located just above the furnace, traditionally
  kept around 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. There, the glass loosens up into the viscosity
  of rubber, suitable for additional shaping. I'll say it again: long, hard tubes
  of glass get shoved <i>in</i> the
  glory hole and they're not pulled out until they're soft and floppy.</p>
<p>The yins and yangs  of bong making are simple and straightforward. Air is
  forcefully blown into a bong during its construction; air is forcefully sucked
  out of a bong throughout its life span. An empty bong needs to be filled, 
  a filled bong needs to be emptied. Supercooled
  bong glass has no solidifying
  temperature: it continues to undergo a gradual
  change of shape and size over the course of many thousands of years. This means
  that whether you're super stoned or only a tiny bit stoned, your favorite glass
  bong <b>really
  is melting</b> in
   slow motion as it sits there on your desk next to your dusty keyboard and
Pepperidge Farm Mint Milanos. <i>Bong appetit!</i> </p>
<p><img src="bh_wtc.jpg" width="164" height="218" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >In
  September of 2001, terrorists converted New York's <a href="/library/history/wtc/">Trade Center</a> towers into
  the world's largest bongs. Acres of smoke and debris billowed out the stacks
  for miles, higher and higher into the atmosphere. <img src="bh_stewie.jpg" width="234" height="459" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Unfortunately,
  nobody got stoned except
  <b>Attorney General <a href="/library/bio/usa/john-ashcroft/">John Ashcroft</a>,</b> who promptly spearheaded America's very
  first anti-bong division, <i>Operation
  Pipe Dreams,</i> as part
  of Homeland Security's efforts to investigate and track the commerce of suspected
terrorism. You might say he <i><b>green lighted</b></i> the notion that bong
peddlers should be demonized as much as individuals who dare traffic in porno
movies. Both groups are now subject to the same sudden raids, surprise searches,
and summary seizures. Bada bing, bada bong. </p>
<p> "Quite simply, the illegal drug paraphernalia industry has invaded the
  homes of families across the country without their knowledge," Ashcroft
said at a press conference. "This illegal,
billion-dollar industry will no longer be ignored by law enforcement."</p>
<p><b><i>Paraphernalia.</i></b> What a crazy, stoned-up Dr. Seuss word! More
  than just bongs are under the microscope: Operation Pipe Dreams of course takes
  aim against pipes as well -- not to mention screens, bowls, rolling papers,
  nitrous oxide canisters, whippets, measurement scales and balances, blenders,
  pill crushers, empty plastic baggies, razor blades, rubber bands, dilutents,
  <img src="bh_bear.jpg" width="168" height="374" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >solvents
  and adulterants like baking soda. Even <b>clothespin roach clips</b> are
  par for the course, so named because <i>pot
  holder</i>  was already taken. All objects observed sitting directly adjacent
  to your bong can be considered "paraphernalia," so maybe your cat should sleep
  somewhere else.</p>
<p>One bong, two bong, three bong, floor. As governmental databases and marketing
  firms continue aggregating their combined knowledge of American citizenry and
  their purchasing histories, life will grow increasingly difficult for the consumers
  of bongs. It's no longer hard to envision modern scenarios where individual
  applicants are denied health insurance for their families until they can satisfactorily
  explain away that peculiar 1998 debit card purchase of $120.00 made at Stoners
  Pot Palace in Seattle, Washington. Buying bongs over the Internet offers less
anonymity than you might expect, which quite frankly is flagrant false advertising.</p>
<p>In 2003, comedy legend <b>Tommy Chong</b> (formerly of <i>Cheech & Chong</i>)
  was sentenced to nine months in prison for selling Middle Eastern-inspired
  glass bongs on the Internet. There was a modest array to choose from -- none
  too over the top -- with models like <i>Babe, Big Bamboo, Topanga,</i> and
  yes, even one called the<i> Cheech</i>. </p>
<p><img src="bh_chong2.jpg" width="200" height="244" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >The sting operation involved exactly the level
  creativity one might expect from the federal government: law enforcement officers
  placed orders for bongs from two of Chong's businesses, <i>Chong Glass</i> and <i>Nice
    Dreams Enterprises</i>. They paid for the bongs, then raided Chong's home
    once the merchandise was delivered. If the bongs had been fashioned to resemble
  animated characters from Pixar's <i>Finding
    Nemo </i> instead
  of Egyptian or Arab designs, Chong might have remained outside the radar of
  personnel working at the highest levels of the Bush administration.</p>
<p>Later, Tommy would talk to <i>Playboy</i> magazine: "I heard a bang on the
  door at 5:30 a.m. When I opened it, DEA agents in flak jackets rushed in with
  their weapons drawn. They went from room to room yelling clear, clear, clear!" </p>
<p><img src="bh_freechong.gif" width="185" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >To streamline Chong's incarceration, prosecutors spoke less about his bong
  company -- and more about his long history of <i>portraying characters</i> who
  glamorized drug use in the movies. No genuinely remarkable efforts were made
  to distinguish Chong from his satirical movie roles or comedy writing efforts;
  he was presented as someone who regularly trivialized efforts to curtail drug
  proliferation. Chong's greatest crime was manufacturing decades' worth of pot-related <b>humor</b> in
  which cops were seen to be bumbling or inept. </p>
<p>When it became clear that prosecutors <b>were actually serious</b> about
  Chong's bongs, the 64-year-old comedian pled guilty to violating federal paraphernalia
  laws in an effort to protect his son, whose own water pipe business was next
  on the authorities' chopping block. Perhaps John Ashcroft and his flak jacket
  squad might be interested in kicking down the doors of the Smithsonian Institute,
  which has a permanent bong exhibit. Admission is free.</p>
<p><img src="bh_leno-2.jpg" width="300" height="211" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Prior
  to the bust, Tommy Chong never had anything resembling a criminal record --
  just six comedy records which each went gold, and seven feature films.
  Of the fifty-five individuals swept up in the Pipe Dream bust, he
  was the only one jailed and the only individual ordered to pay fines of 
  $20,000. Chong was sentenced on <a href="/library/crime/terrorism/september_11/">September 11</a>, 2003 -- and placed in a minimum-security
  prison in Northern California. Lacking even a single prior arrest was something
  he found slightly embarrassing among his prison pals. When asked what he was
  in for, Chong would clear his throat and mumble <i><b>bongs.</b></i></p>
<p>"My time in jail wasn't bad," Chong says in the 2006 documentary <b>a/k/a
  Tommy Chong.</b>  "For the most part, I was with my fans. They even had to
  come up with some kind of rule where guards weren't allowed to talk to me or
  ask for my autograph. It was like a rest home. When you get as old as I am,
  you don't need to get stoned to be slow and stupid."</p>
<p><b><img src="bh_smart.jpg" width="400" height="263" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" >Welps, </b>that's
  the <i>much ado</i> about bongs and bong-related whatnot. Hopefully me and
  my friend here have proved that we're one hundred percent over the age of eighteen
  and therefore legally able to purchase a water pipe. And so, kind sir, we'll
  take that twelve-chamber, inverted pyrex water hookah, one Bubbles Powerpuff
  Pipe, and these d'ope-smoking Homer bongs. Here's a credit card with the
  name of someone who appears to be a woman, but who is actually my mom because
  we both have the same name. Also I'm gonna need some metal screens, a pack
  of rolling papers, and this bag of peanut M&M's.
  And could you please point us in the general direction of where we might be
  able to score a little <i>p-o-t.</i> </p>
