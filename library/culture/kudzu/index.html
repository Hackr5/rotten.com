<h1>Kudzu</h1>

<p>To be considered "carnivorous," a plant must fulfill two requirements: 
  it must be able to absorb nutrients from dead animals near its surfaces, and 
  it must posses an evolutionary adaptation whose primary mission is the active 
  attraction, capture, and digestion of prey.</p>
<p>Because carnivorous plants like the Venus Flytrap live in poor soil, they can 
  only thrive in boggy, marshland environments or man-made greenhouses with a 
  high level of humidity. <b>Kudzu</b> on the other hand, while hardly carnivorous, 
  is by definition an <i>invasive alien species,</i> often referred to as the 
  rodent of the botanical world. It can grow nearly anywhere. In warm, humid climates, 
  a single kudzu chain can grow over a foot each day. It scales up and over walls, 
  climbs telephone poles, and effectively replicates itself into surrounding neighborhoods 
  in all directions, multiple city blocks at a time. Kudzu scales and coils around power lines, reaching out in rainy weather to cause electrical 
  arcs and power outages approximately three hundred times each year. It drapes itself over trees 
  and entire forests, concealing them like an enormous picnic blanket. When left to its 
  own devices, it will expand in size and scope to cover any fixed object in its 
  proximity. Nearby vegetation will be completely destroyed, as Kudzu moves to 
  block any and all available sunlight to competing greenery.</p>
<p>Kudzu 
  is a living, breathing vine, native to Japan and China. As early 
  as 2699 B.C., Chinese Emperor Chon-nong listed Kudzu in a catalog of herbs. In Japan, the roots are made into Kudzu powder, which is used like cornstarch 
  for thickening, while the leaves are cooked as vegetables.
<img src="kudzu-car.jpg" width="400" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="7" align="left">
The vines can also 
  be spun into fibers, and woven into water-resistant cloth.
Kudzu 
  plants were originally imported to the United States as "workhorse" 
  plants in 1876 during the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
  The expo was a science fair on a grand scale, and people were invited to display 
  exhibits celebrating the country's 100th birthday. Since Kudzu had large leaves 
  and sweet-smelling blooms, American gardeners latched onto it for decorative 
  purposes. Little did the farmers know the plant would soon latch back.</p>
<p>Charles and Lillie Pleas were Florida nursery operators who discovered that 
  animals would happily eat the plant, and promoted its use for forage in the 
  1920s. Their Glen Arden Nursery in Chipley sold Kudzu plants and seeds through 
  the mail, and their nursery proudly displayed an historical obelisk marker bearing 
  the phrase "Kudzu Developed Here." During the Great Depression, the 
  Soil Conservation Service promoted Kudzu for erosion control. Hundreds of young 
  men were given work planting Kudzu through the Civilian Conservation Corps. 
  Farmers were paid as much as eight dollars an acre as incentive to plant fields 
  of these "Miracle Vines" in the 1940s. This would later turn out to 
  be the worst agricultural blooper American farmers had <img src="kudzu-9.jpg" width="450" height="338" hspace="10" vspace="7" align="right">ever 
  seen.</p>

<p>Yes, at first the plant helped prevent erosion. By planting Kudzu along inclined 
  slopes near the sides of heavily-trafficked roads, the vines served as strong 
  netting, resulting in fewer mudslides and reduced property damage. Hugh H. Bennett was head of the United States Conservation Service in 1945. 
  He wrote and essay extolling the virtues of Kudzu for <i>Reader's Digest:</i> 
  "What, short of a miracle, can you call this plant? Kudzu has forced our 
  service to revise our appraisal of a lot of severely eroded land as having been 
  ruined for further agricultural use. And it is not only a crop for gouged-out 
  land; it is a splendid crop for good land, too. It will cover a cornfield in 
  one year; the next spring or summer it can be plowed and the land planted to 
  corn; then after the last cultivation of the corn it will again spread over 
  the field, stop the erosion, store more nitrogen, and at the first hard frost 
  lay down a carpet of rich leaf litter at least the equal of forest litter. All 
  this in one year!" </p>
<p>
Indeed. Under the right conditions, Kudzu vines can grow sixty feet per year, 
  strangling everything unchecked in its path. Kudzu was exalted and praised for 
  decades for its vigor and disease-resistant attributes, despite 
  warnings published in 1938 by botanist David Fairchild. He warned about the 
  invasiveness of the plant, predicting it would become a nuisance to farmers, 
  road workers, and slow-moving children.

So what's the big deal? Just put up a help-wanted poster, get a bunch of workers 
  to yank the plant up out of the ground and throw the discarded bags behind a 
  <a href="/library/crime/corporate/mcdonalds/">McDonald's</a>. Unfortunately, Kudzu is a bit like tapeworm: you can chop it 
  up, liquefy it, burn it, bury it under the sea, shoot it into outer space -- 
  but it's still gonna be there. No matter how hard you work to eradicate all 
  traces of this weed, it's like trying to get tinkle out of a swimming pool. 
  The United States is too busy losing the war on <a href="/library/crime/drugs/">drugs</a>, violence on television, 
<img src="kudzu_impact.jpg" width="230" height="154" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">
  <a href="/library/culture/pornography/">pornography</a>, and <a href="/library/crime/terrorism/">terrorism</a> to worry about Kudzu. Besides, it costs $600 an acre 
  to squirt the stuff with heavy duty chemicals. If the chemicals are sprayed 
  in a residential area, offspray will blow into other yards, killing everything 
  else. Nobody knows which is worse: erosion or kudzu. And the chemicals hardly 
  do a good job.</p>
<p>In 1972, the USDA finally hopped down off its high horse and declared that 
  kudzu was a <b>weed</b>, not a precious crop sent from heaven above. The U.S. 
  Forest Service in Auburn, Alabama began to research methods to destroy it. Herbicides 
  were the first approach - until it was determined the plant had actually developed 
  a taste for plant killer, making it even stronger. By 1997, Kudzu had been declared 
  a <b>noxious</b> weed, which essentially created a mandate for people living 
  in high-risk Kudzu areas to remove as much of the plant as they could from their 
  property.<img src="sf.jpg" width="280" height="386" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"> 
  Good luck with that.</p>
<p>"Most people don't care how kudzu got here", says Tom Kowalski of the state 
  Department of Agriculture. "They don't want to know where it came from 
  or how it got here. They want
<img src="speed.jpg" width="200" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">
chemicals to kill it and they want them now, and 
  they want to kill it in one spraying. But you can't just spray it once and have 
  it go away. The reason it's here, and the reason it was planted so extensively, 
  is because it is so [goddamn] tough."</p>
<p>Kudzu now covers nine million square miles of the United States, and shows 
  no signs of slowing down. In the deep south, legend dictates that you keep your 
  windows closed and locked at night, lest it creep in and bury your children. 
  To this day, there's only one surefire method of attacking the Kudzu problem: 
  let loose an army of goats and sheep, and have them snack on it until they're 
  satiated.</p>
