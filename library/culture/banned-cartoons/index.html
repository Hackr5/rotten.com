      <p><img src="intro.jpg" width="277" height="417" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">If 
        you squint your eyes long and hard enough, any fictional character on 
        <i>any</i> animated cartoon begins to develop its own offensive, socially 
        improper qualities. Even the dynamics inherent to seemingly innocent cartoon 
        settings and situations can appear sinister when scrutinized by qualified 
        armchair cynics.</p>
      <p>Belgian cartoonist Pierre "Peyo" Culliford's <i>Smurfs</i>, 
        for instance, copyright 1958. Two hundred tiny blue males harmonizing 
        amongst themselves in a woodsy, European hamlet polka-dotted with mushroomy 
        phallus cupcakes. The setup alone might be sufficient enough cause for 
        concern - but the fact that there's only <i>one</i> female to pass around? 
        That can't be right. Never mind the fact that <i>Peyo</i> also wrote and 
        drew a short-lived comic called "Poussy". </p>
      <p>And hey now, what about Inspector Gadget's bulbous, nodular profile? 
        Doesn't that lead some people to believe he's ten times the Jew <i><a href="/library/culture/spongebob/">SpongeBob's</a></i> 
        Squidward Tentacles ever was? Even though we all know in our heart of 
        hearts that Mr. Krabs is in fact Bikini Bottom's primary penny pincher?</p>
      <p>Between 1928 and 1950, America's premiere animators across the <a href="/library/bio/business/walt-disney/">Walt Disney</a> Corporation, Warner Bros., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Merrie Melodies, 
        Looney Tunes and R.K.O. Radio Pictures painstakingly assembled brilliant 
        <i>and</i> offensive animated vignettes requiring <b>no</b> undue stretchery 
        of the imagination. Hundreds of reels, thousands of cartoons, millions 
        of individual frames sketched and watercolored by hand - and more often 
        than people care to admit, content which directly ridiculed the behavior 
        and appearance of blacks, homosexuals, southerners, the mentally ill, 
        Arabs, Candians, Eskimos, Italians, Hispanics, Asians, Jews, Germans, 
        Russians, Australians, Indians, the Scottish, the French, the Irish - 
        and yes, even Martians. </p>
      <p><img src="nc.jpg" width="303" height="196" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">This 
        was the golden age of animation, after all. Illustrators and comedy engineers 
        were only <i>too</i> delighted to inject healthy doses of social tension 
        into the public meme. Colorful, extended virtuoso sequences were married 
        to Carl Stalling's sprawling, frenetic musical score and Mel Blanc's hyper-enthusiastic 
        vocal characterizations. Together, this massive ensemble yielded some 
        of the most respected entertainment products our planet has ever produced. 
        The sheer <i>output,</i> the <i>quantity</i> alone staggers the imagination. 
        These were people working in an exploding new field, individuals genuinely 
        married to their work.</p>
      <p>In the early days, cartoons were screened before feature films at fancy 
        schmancy "moving picture" theaters - often social engagements 
        where men and women were inspired to wear their Sunday best. Later, these 
        same cartoons would cycle endlessly for decades on broadcast TV or cable 
        syndication courtesy of modern inventions like the <i>tel-o-vision</i>.</p>
      <p><img src="bullets.jpg" width="313" height="233" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">And 
        later still - after the innovation of the video cassette recorder - these 
        priceless artifacts would be made available for home rental, so future 
        generations (and their children, and their children's children) could 
        bear witness to each and every blessed key frame.</p>
      <p>Actually, no. Sorry. As the result of objections by parents, overly sensitive 
        sponsors, timid corporate policy, and "changing" cultural niceties, 
        a substantial portion of these classic cartoons has been lost forever, 
        and some may never again see the light of day.</p>
      <p>Animated features with even the slightest reference to alcohol (including 
        rum cake), adultery, breasts, chewing tobacco, cross-dressing, gambling, 
        marijuana, pornography, profanity, "rim jobs" (i.e. dogs licking 
        each other), vaguely sexual or flirtatious situations, recreational sex 
        toys (i.e. Tom from <i>Tom and Jerry</i> sticks a vacuum cleaner up Mammy 
        Two-Shoes' skirt, producing giggles), smoking of any kind, suicides (i.e. 
        a flusterated Daffy Duck blows his beak around in circles with a shotgun) 
        - and even <i>baby ducklings</i> emerging from their shells in demure 
        strip tease were deemed unacceptable. What's left to laugh at? <b>Dora 
        the Explorer?</b> Rotten Dot Com is confident it speaks for all of us 
        when we say <b><i>screw that</i></b> edumacational bullshit.</p>
      <p><img src="duckstrip.jpg" width="750" height="200"></p>
      <p><i>Chow Hound</i> (1951) directed by Charles M. Jones was a real classic 
        - the story of a muscular dog who exploits a cat and mouse, concluding 
        with a vicious turn of the tables: the dog is planted belly-up on a countertop 
        and force-fed gallons of gravy <i>("...And don't forget the gravy!") 
        </i>through a garden hose. Well, consider those childhood memories stricken 
        from the record. These days it falls under the category of <b>imitatable 
        behavior,</b> i.e. too masochistic for children and families with pets.</p>
      <p>Merrie Melodies chose to portray Australia as a desolate, sparsely-treed 
        landscape populated by bouncing kangaroos and portly aborigines who communicate 
        with one another by chucking boomerangs or screaming <b>UNGA BUNGA BUNGA.</b> 
        That's what critics had the good sense to label an <b>unflattering portrayal,</b> 
        and it too was yanked from public shelves.</p>
      <p><img src="hitler.gif" width="348" height="291" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><img src="speedyg.jpg" width="81" height="115" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">And 
        <i>pardoné moi,</i> but has anyone heard from <b>Speedy Gonzales</b> 
        lately? The Mexican rat? <i>Yipa yipa, andele arriba?</i> Nor have we. 
        The Cartoon Network, which since 1999 has been the only television venue 
        for vintage Looney Tunes, removed the Hispanic heretic from their day 
        and nighttime schedules. Perhaps executives forgot Speedy actually won 
        an Academy Award in 1955. Phone calls to Speedy's dimwitted cousin Slowpoke 
        Rodriguez (the world's slowest mouse) went unanswered.</p>
      <p><i><img src="bl.jpg" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></i>Today, 
        the most popular racial phobery (and war-inspired propaganda) has a new 
        impetus: <i>South Park,</i> with its remarkable and timely depictions 
        of both Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. Swiping cultural cues from 
        featurettes pioneered by Disney and Warner Bros., <i>South Park</i> manages 
        to massage attitudes and manipulate the American agenda by unleashing 
        brilliant leaflet campaigns of its own design.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="sad.jpg" width="164" height="223" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"> 
        Osama is illustrated wearing "farty pants," mincing and prancing 
        about the stage like a young gazelle. Saddam is portrayed as- well, quite 
        frankly a goddamn little faggot who refuses to keep his pants on. His 
        voice is squeaky and ridiculous. His head flaps up and down like Canada's 
        own Terence and Phillip. In <i>South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,</i> 
        Mr. Hussein is observed wiggling an oversized jelly dong in Satan's face.</p>
      When the film is fired up in a crowded movie house, there's no other word 
      apart from <b>refreshing</b> when one observes how many people are actually 
      sitting back and <b>laughing</b> like they're supposed to. It's a harmless <i>cartoon</i> 
      after all. Primitive, faraway lands where <i>bronze-toned</i> townspeople 
      have towels for top hats and cloth diapers for dungarees? Now that's just 
      ridiculous! We'll be right back after these messages from 1961.<br> 
      <br>
      <i>Hey Fred - how about a Winston break? Winston's the one filtered cigarette 
      that delivers flavor twenty times a pack. Filtered blend makes the big taste 
      difference - and only Winston has it!</i> <img src="flint.jpg" width="750" height="200" vspace="10"> 
      <i>Yeah, Barn - up front where it counts, in front of the pure white filter. 
      Winston packs rich tobaccos specially selected and specially processed for 
      good flavor and filtered smoking. Winston tastes good... like a cigarette 
      should! </i> 
      <p>The list goes on and on. <i>Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarves. 
        Goldilocks and the Jivin' Bears.</i> Ownership of Warner Bros. cartoons 
        passed through United Artists in 1968. They created a "Censored 11" 
        list of cartoons they'd refuse to air or make available for purchase on 
        any media. When Time-Warner bought Turner Broadcasting in 1996, Cartoon 
        Network turned over the Bugs Bunny rights to Warner Bros, and later sparred 
        with them over an existing promise to sell material to <img src="bunga.jpg" width="313" height="213" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Viacom's 
        Nickelodeon and Walt Disney's ABC.</p>
      <p>See, every June is <b>June Bugs</b> month at Cartoon Network, and it's 
        a veritable Bugs Bunny marathon. Fearful of a potential backlash, AOL 
        Time-Warner very nearly dropped a major anvil on Cartoon Network's proposed 
        festival in 2001. Racially charged episodes were aired out of order, late 
        at night with the following disclaimer: </p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"Cartoon Network does not 
        endorse the use of racial slurs. These vintage cartoons are presented 
        as representative of the time in which they were created and are presented 
        for their historical value."</font></p>
      <p>Historical value? Rock on.<i> Which is Witch</i> features Bugs Bunny 
        in a classic Looney Tunes sequence of spear-chuckling, junglebunny slapstick. 
        Broad-lipped, chocolate skinned natives populate a cannibalistic aborigine 
        island of pure whimsy - and it would seem the young master Bugs is keen 
        to participate! His first priority: <b>blend in,</b> through the ingenious 
        use of a tightly coiled spring and tasteful table settings.</p>
      <p><img src="bugsdress.jpg" width="750" height="250"></p>
      <p><b><i><img src="bugsmouth.gif" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><font size="+1">WHASSUP</font>, 
        doc<font size="+1">??</font></i></b> Oh, that wascally wacist. How could 
        America's best-loved wabbit be so blacktose intolerant?</p>
      <p>Even more hare-raising skeletons dangle at the rear of <i>Uncle Tom's 
        Cabinet</i> - another rich, tonal assault perpetranimated upon African 
        Americans in 1949 and a spoof of Harriet Beecher Stowe's antislavery novel. 
        And who could forget <i>Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips</i> in 1928?</p>
      <p><i>"Japs!"</i> screeches Bugs. <i>"Hundreds of them!"</i></p>
      <p>He disguises himself as an ice cream vendor and doles out grenades on 
        lollipop sticks. <i>Here ya go, bowl-legs. Here's one for you, monkeyface. 
        Here y'are, slanty-eyes. Everybody gets one. </i><br>
      </p>
      <p> In <i>All This and Rabbit Stew</i>, Bugs beats a black hunter at dice 
        and wins his clothes. But it wasn't the implicit characterization of black 
        people as listless gamblers which critics deemed offensive, it was merely 
        the suggestion that black people were<i> less intelligent than rabbits.</i> 
        Meanwhile, hillbilly rednecks with bushy moustaches have yet to twist 
        their knickers whenever Bugs outwits Yosemite Sam.</p>
      <p><img src="bbb.jpg" width="299" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">When 
        Spike Lee made <i>Bamboozled</i> (a film dealing extensively with black 
        stereotypes in Hollywood) Warner Bros. denied his request to include images 
        of Bugs in blackface. But whether it's Bugs Bunny tackling key issues 
        of racism, or Popeye the Sailor Man binging on spinach while muttering 
        to himself a private chorus of "you're a sap / sap / sap / mister 
        Jap," or even P-p-P-Porky P-p-P-</p>
      <p>P-p-P-pork P-p-P-p-Porky P-p--</p>
      <p>P-p-P-p-P-p-P-p-P-p-P-p-P-p-P-p-P-p-P-</p>
      <p>Okay, never mind. But if you think words like <b>banned</b> or <b>censored</b> 
        imply a degree of government intrusion which feels just a wee bit exaggeratory, 
        consider this. In 1942, when the U.S. Treasury Department ran a whisper 
        shy of funds during the war effort, they wisely sought financial counsel 
        from the Looney Tunes division of Merrie Melodies. In theaters from coast 
        to coast, Bugs Bunny showed up <i>once again</i> in full Al Jolson blackface, 
        performing a musical number meant to peddle stamps and U.S. Savings bonds. 
      </p>
      <p><img src="band.jpg" width="750" height="200"><br>
        <img src="mk2.jpg" width="317" height="234" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">The 
        cartoon archetype of American smart guy / foreign dumb guy is a time-honored 
        crucible best served during a war, and the Walt Disney Corporation concocted 
        a few classics as well.</p>
      <p>The <a href="/library/imagery/swastika/">Swastika</a>-dotted landscape of <i>Der Fuehrer's Face</i> (1942) 
        was the perfect brass band musical vehicle for Donald Duck, a Nazi munitions 
        worker who "alternates between screwing nose cones onto bombs and 
        saluting framed portraits of <a href="/library/bio/nazi/adolf-hitler/">Adolf Hitler</a>". The Japanese make 
        a cameo appearance too - and wouldn't you know it, they've got lime green 
        skin, big bulbous eyeglasses, Tupperware haircuts and protruding, jaggedy-ass 
        dentures rivaling those of Bugs Bunny.</p>
      <p>The title song, performed by Spike Jones and his City Slickers, won an 
        honest-to-gosh <b>Oscar</b> for Best Short, beating out veteran animator 
        Leon Schlesinger's wheezing, preachy and pedantic <i>Pigs in a Polka</i>. 
        Other big winners that year: honkabilly big mouth James Cagney for Best 
        Actor in <i>Yankee Doodle Dandy</i> and Irving Berlin, who penned the 
        music and libretto for <i>White Christmas</i>.</p>
      <p><img src="face.jpg" width="750" height="200"></p>
      <p><img src="tinyd.jpg" width="100" height="100" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><img src="bow.jpg" width="313" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Donald 
        T. Duck would later redeem himself as an air ranger in <i>Commando Duck</i>, 
        a deftly animated farce combining traditional Disney magic with anti-Japanese 
        tomfoolery. The premise: he parachutes into enemy territory during World 
        War II. It's treacherous terrain, marked by snipers hiding inside myopic, 
        bucktoothed tree trunks which speak in pigeon-toed English, alternately 
        bowing respectfurry toward one another and offering endress aporogies.</p>
      <p><i><img src="pin.jpg" width="251" height="181" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">A-prease 
        and a-thank you! Time to shooting now prease I hope! Japanese custom say 
        always to shooting a man in the back prease! </i><i>Ah so! </i><i>Ah so! 
        </i>And so on. Donald's target coordinates on his map are F-8. <i>Fate, 
        </i>get it?<br>
        <br>
        Donald's mission: contact the enemy, surround them single-handedly, and 
        wash them out. After a series of slaphappy bumbling mishaps, he manages 
        to direct an avalanche of tumbling boulders down a gushing waterfall toward 
        a Japanese military facility. The airfield is flooded. Hundreds of Nipponese 
        soldiers drown, and dozens of red-spotted planes hang like limp turkeys 
        from dead, drooping trees. Sad, squawky trumpets<i><b> wup-wahh</b></i> 
        across the horizon. But not in a <i>hate crimey</i> kinda way! This comical 
        vignette, for all intents and purposes, eagerly delivers the very quintessence 
        of merriment.<br>
        <img src="washed.jpg" width="750" height="200" vspace="10"><br>
        Witnessing the devastation, Donald quacks to himself with smug, self-satisfied 
        laughter and pens a note to his superiors: "Enemy washed out." 
        Fifty years later, in 1992, Disney would get busy irking the Arab-American 
        community with sharp lyrics from <i>Aladdin, </i>"where they cut 
        off your ear / if they don't like your face. It's barbaric / but hey / 
        it's home."<img src="class.jpg" width="750" height="200" vspace="10">

        <tr> 
          <td width="87%"><p>But topping the eye-poppingly outrageous charts of 
              historical cartoon propaganda is without a doubt Disney's regrettable 
              vignette, <i>Education For Death</i>, which graphically details 
              the life and times of Hitler youth. The narrator solemnly intones 
              the distorted text of Gregor Ziemer's <i>The Making of The Nazi</i>.</p>
            <p>German adults are portrayed in classic Disney "sinister bulldog" 
              style: barrel chest, small rear end, bowed legs, and no neck. The 
              bellowing, red-faced instructor's jowls flop around like coattails 
              as he berates a kindergarten classroom full of Bambi-eyed waifs 
              in lederhosen, whose pluckish heads are delightfully oversized. 
              The military professor's singular goal: get these scatterbrained 
              kids to appreciate Hitler's way of thinking.<br>
              <br>
              The lesson plan is presented at the blackboard. Chalk drawings of 
              a fox eating a rabbit illustrate nature's intended course: the weaker 
              species (i.e. Jews and bunnies) are justly but inevitably devoured 
              without mercy by superior forces.</p></td>

      <p>As <i>Education For Death</i> descends toward its bloody climax, the 
        animation is bathed in murky red tones. The viewer is urged to "listen 
        closely to the fanatic cry" of the German people. What follows is 
        a pounding orchestral soundtrack and a relentless montage punctuating 
        all things fire and brimstone.<img src="gurk.jpg" width="272" height="235" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left">

      <p>Classic hardbound volumes of literature and philosophy are piled high,

      Nine times out of ten, a person won't even notice racist or hateful overtones 
      in a cartoon unless the idea is planted firmly in head. By refusing to unearth 
      and revive historical artifacts, societies sustain immeasurably more damage 
      than brief exposure to racial toxins from old-timey cartoon doodles. Novelist 
      Kurt Andersen (<i>Turn of the Century,</i> 1999) muses, "If we don't 
      know our history in all of its complicated detail, how are we supposed to 
      understand the present?"<br>
        <img src="endcredit.jpg" width="316" height="232" hspace="6" vspace="10" align="right">
        To allow ourselves only a bland, repackaged version of the past is - how 
        do you say - kind of a Mickey Mouse approach.<br>

      <p><i>"Marching and heiling, heiling and marching. In him is planted 
        no seed of laughter, hope, tolerance or mercy. For him - only heiling

        And he does nothing than what the party wants him to do. And so he marches,
