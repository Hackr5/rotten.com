McCollum kills himself with a .22 caliber handgun after spending the day listening to <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/music/ozzy-osbourne/">Ozzy Osbourne</a> records.

<td nowrap align=right valign=top><tt>23 Dec 1985</tt></td>
<td valign=top><font size=-1>In a school playground, James Vance presses a shotgun to his chin and pulls the trigger. He and cohort Raymond Belknap had forged a suicide pact while listening to <i>Stained Class</i> by Judas Priest. But where Belknap succeeded, Vance fails. The dumbshit lives, but it destroyed his face. He later uses his disfigurement to his advantage, terrorizing small children on his bicycle.

<td valign=top><font size=-1>At his Toronto metal shop, artist Glen Soikie picks up a 12" adjustable wrench and bashes in the skull of Mexican musician Jorge Garcia-Briones. Evidently the pair had smoked some crack and then gotten into an argument about the 1978 horror classic <i><a href="http://www.rottenstore.com/fod.html" target="_blank">Faces of Death</a></i>. "Every time that fucking guy grabbed at me, I fucking hit him. He didn't stop fucking grabbing me."</font></td></tr>
