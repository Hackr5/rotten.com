Among the other items associated with the promotion are bottle openers with the slogan "Drink Responsibly. Don't Drink Milk." A firestorm of controversy immediately erupts, including a condemnation from MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) who call the campaign irresponsible.</font></td>

But it would wake up consumers." Later, she continues: "I openly hope it [hoof and mouth disease] comes here. It will bring economic harm only for those who profit from giving people heart attacks and giving animals a concentration camp-like existence. It would be good for animals, good for human health and good for the environment." Note that such an outbreak would bring the deaths of millions of animals, including those not used for slaughter, such as dairy cows. <i>BBC</i> interview.</font></td>

McVeigh writes a return letter, making several salient points and statements: "Truth is, I understand your cause - I've seen slaughter houses myself - but I still believe in reasonable taking and eating of game (as an outdoorsman and hunter)... I cannot sustain a prolonged intellectual debate on the subject as my time is short, but I'd suggest hitting <a href="/library/bio/crime/serial-killers/unabomer/">Ted Kaczynski</a> up for his opinions on the subject." Also: "Where do you draw the line and what standard is used to define that line? Those that are in it for the health benefits accept poultry and fish as edible. Where do those opposed to suffering stand? (Ever see a fish struggling out of water?) What about grubs/worms/etc.? And finally, plants are alive too," he continued. "They react to stimuli (including pain); have circulation systems, etc. So how about them?"</font></td>

In an interview with the Financial Times that appears two days later, PETA Coordinator Bruce Friedrich says "Mr. McVeigh's decision to go vegetarian groups him with some of the world's greatest visionaries, including Albert Schweitzer, Mohandas Gandhi, Leo Tolstoy and Albert Einstein, all of whom advocated vegetarianism as an extension of humanitarianism." (This is an exact duplicate of a statement in a letter sent to McVeigh's warden asking his remaining meals be made Vegetarian.)
