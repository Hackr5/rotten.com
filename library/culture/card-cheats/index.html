<h1>Card Cheats</h1>
<p>Traditional parlor games like Five Card Stud, Texas Hold 'Em, Blackjack and
  Baccarat might have been a lot more fun a few hundred years ago, without all
  those swiveling casino cameras trained on your every <a href="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/">tweak</a> and twitch.</p>
<p>The history of card cheating as pop-cultural <a href="/library/culture/passions/">indulgence</a> was first
  illustrated in oil paintings by Georges de La Tour and Michelangelo Merisis
  da Caravaggio, who in the early 1400s and 1500s brought their visions of courtly
  play into public view. Opting not to airbrush away Norman Rockwellian visuals
  of individual treachery and conspiracy among thieves, these paintings
  are content to wink directly at the viewer, inviting him or her to cast aside
  suspicion and celebrate a shared deceit.</p>
<p>Card cheating as a viable <b>career choice</b> was first openly propositioned
  in 1902 by S. W. Erdnase, in his damning anonymous treatise, <i>Artifice, Ruse
  and Subterfuge, </i>also known as<i> The
  Expert at the Card Table</i>.
  Erdnase's publication revealed for the first time in print nearly every cheating
  strategy imaginable, most of which are still being referenced by today's top
  hustlers and teenage magicians.</p>
<p><img src="cc_phatness.jpg" width="400" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Erdnase,
  whose real identity has adequately eluded historians, offered his book to the
  public with no excuse for its existence: "To
  all lovers of card games it should prove interesting, and as a basis of card
  entertainment it is practically inexhaustible. It will not make the innocent
  vicious, or transform the the pastime player into a professional; or make the
  fool wise, or curtail the annual crop of suckers -- but whatever the result
  may be, if it sells, it will accomplish the primary motive of its author, as
  he needs the money."</p>
<p>It is cautiously recommended
    to patrons of the <i>Rotten
      Library</i> that
        these techniques be exerted only upon despised family members (or friends
      of friends) in private home games where quick getaways are a conceivable
    possibility.</p>
<p>Wholesale
  magic dealers manufacture <b>holdout</b> devices: retractable mechanical arms
  capable of thrusting up to fifteen cards directly into the palm of your hand
  when they're  needed most. Holdouts are strapped to the forearm with elastic
  belts, enabling free movement of the elbow when the wearer is sitting or standing.
  This
  rig can easily facilitate the production or exchange of cards by applying tension
  and release: making a strong fist is often enough to trigger the prop. Cards
  are bent <img src="cc_magichold.jpg" width="480" height="428" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">slightly
  during the delivery process, making them easy to conceal and grip between your
  fingers and integrate into your existing array.</p>
<p>Taking advice from the Erdnase book into the twentieth century, a simplified
  device called the "reverse
  holdout" has become the premiere cheating strategy of choice during SAT exams
  at high schools across the nation.</p>
<p>Imagine
  you're in class taking a test, clutching a cheat sheet in your hand. You've
  printed your notes on sturdy cardboard, and anchored one end of it (through
  a punched-out hole, or otherwise) to a rubber band conveniently safety-pinned
  all the way up inside of your shirt sleeve or sweater vest. When the teacher
  walks by, simply release the card from your grip, and the elastic will "zip" the
  card up your sleeve, immediately away from curious eyeballs. Naturally you
  will have to reach your hand up your sleeve to retrieve the cheat sheet, but
  that can only be described as a <b>small price to pay</b> for the spontaneous
  ability to show a teacher your hands and balls are <i>empty and clean</i> on
  all sides. This cheating strategy works best when used in conjunction with
  a long-sleeved, white-collared shirt with unbuttoned cuffs. It takes a little
  practice: the last thing you want is a cheat sheet snagging on your wrist watch,
  or a rubber band / safety pin combo snapping off and shooting across the room
  into someone's face. </p>
<p><b><img src="cc_brands.jpg" width="400" height="482" align="left">Marked
    cards, </b>sometimes referred to as "counterfeit" cards, mimick the styles
    and colors of popular, respectable brands. Poor quality inks and card stock
    can warrant immediate detection, leading to significantly embarrassing gun
    play during game play. Some false cards have spots of missing print, others
    have blotches of ink on the face cards. Jacks, Queens,
    and Kings are the most difficult to forge due to their exacting, complicated
    design and four-color template. In earlier times, even an expensive deck
    of marked cards might look a little faded, since printing companies fiercely
    guarded their nineteenth-century breakthroughs in spray-mount coating, slicking,
    and matting.</p>
<p>One of counterfeiters'
      earliest targets was a mimick of the <i>Bee</i> bridge-size deck manufactured
      by the U.S. Playing Card Company of Cincinnati, Ohio. Fake <i>Bee</i> decks
      are still being manufactured: they're factory-marked for suit and value,
      and etched into the uppermost (and lowermost) lattice work on the back
      of each card are tiny, coded indicators revealing the hand.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="cc_bee.jpg" width="204" height="282" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">For
      instance. The card shown to the right is in fact the <b>deuce of clubs,</b> so
      represented by a slight "clipping" of the lower corner of the first full
      diamond-shape located in <i>blue negative space</i>. To represent an
    ace, the diamond might have been clipped on top. A similar mark representing
    the suit of spades can be seen on the opposite side, even without the magnification.
    In such a manner, even an ever-so-slightly fanned out poker deal of five
      cards -- jealously guarded in either hand -- can be visually decoded by
      the remaining players at the table.</p>
<p><img src="cc_petal.gif" width="350" height="218" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Another
  commonly forged deck is of course the world-renowned Bicycle<i></i> pack,
  a brand that's been in continuous production since 1885. Today, any traditional
  magic shop carries factory-marked and sealed <i>Bicycle</i> decks employing
  subtle shade work on the back side. Shading involves reducing, obscuring or
  thickening portions of a complex design to embed data about a card's suit
  and value. One errant thin petal in a wheel of otherwise plump flowers in the
  card shown to the left, for instance, is the signature mark of a shading system.
  This technique is called <i>block out work</i>, and it's so widely known that
  many poker players in private games regularly scan Bicycle decks for
  tell-tale markings before a round even begins. A <i>backwards
  rifle</i> is the
  easiest way to spot a marked deck:  the cheat marks dance along the flowers
  in the card design like a flip-book animation.</p>
<p><img src="cc_shade.jpg" width="197" height="176" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">If
  the marking mechanism is sufficiently advanced enough to pass a rifle test,
  the cheating system might actually be <b>invisible</b>  to
  the naked eye. The markings on <i>luminous
  shade</i> cards are applied with a quick brush of liquid solution impervious
  to standard UV light. The marks can only be observed through a special filter,
  ostensibly affixed to the inner lens of a cheater's sunglasses. Such a device
  would effectively make you capable of seeing through cards, walls, and ladies'
  underpants like Neo in <i>The
  Matrix</i>. </p>
<p>Card cheats
  have formulated age-old and inexhaustible strategies for dynamically marking
  cards  in active play -- cards they didn't have time to prepare in advance.
  The easiest and cleanest method involves arranging cards in a <i>one-way</i> deck:
  a pack of cards with an asymmetric back design or <b>retarded photograph,</b> i<img src="cc_scooby.jpg" width="246" height="246" align="right">n
  which cards of higher value are turned upside down. While individual cards
  often get inverted during play, they won't be disturbed by traditional rifle
  shuffles or one-handed cuts. By monitoring the orientation of cards which slide
  from the dealer's hand to players or the central playing area, cheaters have
  a better chance of knowing where the Aces are at key points during the game. </p>
<p>The next baby step up is <b><i>nicking, </i></b>so named because during play,
  the cheater quietly slices a portion of the card open with a freshly-sharpened
  thumbnail. Nail marking requires that the cheater <b>not
  bite his nails </b>for several
  weeks: the natural  enamels must grow strong enough to perforate the edges
  of slick, coated card stock quickly and cleanly. As a nicker at the table goes
  through hand after hand, more and more cards can be marked in easily discernable
  ways. A nick along the top versus a nick along the side, for instance. Two
  nicks next to one another. A nick on the corner. Advanced nicking involves
  <i>localizing</i> the card marks: performing the same nick twice so the nick
  is visible whether or not the card is right side up. Anything
    which makes its way into your fingers can be nicked -- and equally helpful
    is nicking the <b>shitty
    cards,</b> which can 
  help telegraph well in advance when your opponent is bluffing.</p>
<p><img src="cc_frugal.jpg" width="240" height="240" vspace="10" align="left">If
  you're feeling only slightly bolder than a nicker, try the time-honored technique
  of <b><i>daubing:</i></b> the act of deliberately smudging the back
  or sides of a card in a particular place with a particular substance. At <img src="cc_pokerbot.jpg" width="231" height="252" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">a
  poker table, the two easiest sources of daubing dirt is black ink (transferred
  from a nearby newspaper to your moistened thumb) or cigarette soot from a dirty
  ash tray. If a fellow player observes you dipping your fingers into the ashes,
  insist you were extinguishing a smoldering ember. Black coffee and beverages
  with Kahlua or fruit juice are equally viable substitutes. Subtlety is the
  overarching rule: don't smear your chosen card up with blackface like Ted Danson
  at a Friars Club roast. Nor should you apply a substance too tacky, lest cards
  be observed sticking together in such a way that a deck you've been daubing
  gets discarded in favor of one less "problematic". Stains on card edges can
  last through several games, provided nobody gets wise. Magician's "daub," a
  semi-hard paste which marks cards in play, is available for pennies on the
  dollar, and it's suitable for applying to back designs of any color or complexity. </p>

<p>Possibly you'd prefer to <b><i>crimp</i></b> your ride. Crimping is the act
  of warping, twisting, bending, creasing, or otherwise dog-earing a selected
  card, and it serves a  far greater purpose than secret identification. When
  the corner of a playing card has been bent, its position anywhere in the pack
  is easily spotted. Valued cards in the deck are effectively "bumped" by
  an arced fraction of a degree, casting a slight but slanted shadow onto the
  lower hemisphere of the pack. By eyeballing the thickness of pack hemispheres
  and estimating the number of cards above or below a crimp, one can more confidently
  predict the next occurrence of a winning hand. Please remember that crimping
  is not a full, snapping fold -- you're only warping it a half inch. Don't
curl it up like a quesadilla. </p>
<p><i><b><img src="cc_cash.jpg" width="400" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Card
      counting</b></i> is an activity about as much fun as it sounds: a mathematical
      averaging system inside your own head,
      where points called "weights" are
      mentally assigned to the value of every card in play.
      Counting is by and large the only statistically-proven method of gaining
      some level of advantage over the casino -- but casinos have thwarted most
      counting techniques by mandating that <b>six to eight decks be shuffled
      together</b> prior
      to even the simplest games of Blackjack. Over one hundred different card
      counting systems have been published as of this writing in 2006.</p>
<p>Despite casinos' best efforts to demonize the
    process, card counting is <b>not illegal</b> and therefore cannot be considered
    much of a cheat. Nevada courts ruled long ago that "players are
    free to use any information made available to them," short of conspiracy
    or collusion with
  casino personnel, or using an electronic card counter. The house reserves
    the right to refuse service at any time, however -- and players are regularly
  asked to leave, or perm-banned, or arrested for trespassing.</p>
<p><b><img src="cc_gay.jpg" width="278" height="400" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></b>As a suspected card counter, you might be <i>back roomed</i> -- an outdated
  intimidation process in which casino security taps  you on the shoulder
  and asks you to please follow them. Flanked by sour-faced guards, you're marched
  across the main lobby and through a door marked AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.
  You get a lecture and your picture taken. They escort you into a long hallway,
  down a poorly lit staircase, and through one final door which claims ALARMS
  WILL SOUND if opened. Then you're pushed out that door, into the bright sunshine
    and/or a mud puddle.</p>
<p>One
  hundred years after the initial publication of Erdnase's groundbreaking framework
  for career card cheating, the popularity of Poker is again surging across the
  Western hemisphere. This time around, it's popular with the NASCAR crowd, celebrities
  "showing down" on Bravo, Chinese math students looking to oust cigar-chompin'
  frat boys, and overweight, <a href="/library/bio/crime/spree-killers/mucko/">online shut-ins</a> with severe reality problems.<br>
  <br>
  Why
  <i>not</i> join the new American rennaisance and learn to cheat at cards? At
least put it on your <a href="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/robert-tilton/">to-do list</a>.</p>
