<h1>Vending Machines</h1>

<p>When your great, great grandparents were very small children, the mere notion
  of  winking, blinking, flashing metal robots  capable
  of exchanging nickels for frozen chocolate ice cream 
  was just a crazy daydream.
  But now?
<b>It's science fact.</b></p>
<pre>[SFX: Wonky space music]</pre>
<p>Welcome to the world of tomorrow -- today! Stainless
  steel, safety glass, and plexi-chrome vending machines have evolved so gracefully
  over time that now even the most jaded and suspicious of adults can finally
  take them for granted. Combined with new advances in soda can delivery, snack
  rack dispensary, candy spiral arm technology and credit card verification techniques,
  it's easy to see why <i>vending
  machines</i> are
  truly man's best friend. <b>Beep
boop! Take me to your leader!</b></p>
<p>Would <i>you</i> like
  to establish a career in the automated retail arts? Americans feed vending
  machines over $22 billion each year, but the vending industry is fraught with
  hazards -- including the everpresent need to combat negative public perception.
  Vending machines represent the earliest physical manifestation of corporate
  downsizing and far-fetched notions that a person could ever be replaced by
  a thing. <img src="vm_contents.jpg" width="400" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >They're
  not always associated with quality merchandise, and there's even a perception
  that vending machines can't be trusted. Paid-for Snickers and unreachable Twix
  have too often dangled like mistletoe from coiled dispensaries which failed
  to deploy. Client satisfaction and trust are similarly eroded when there's
  nobody around to complain to. Accountable operators travel all over the state,
  and their full phone numbers are rarely prefixed with 1-800.</p>
<p>Responding to allegations of poor customer service, companies 
  developed
  "smart" vending machines which are meaner and twice as aggressive. The
  most advanced venders come equipped with temperature-sensitive <i>electrothermographs</i>  which
  increase the price of a drink from $1.00 to $1.50 on  particularly hot afternoons.
  Ratios between frequency of use and the passage of time can also be established,
  enabling machines to charge <b>more</b> for drinks at heavily-populated outdoor
  social events. The logic is as follows: if there's a long, steady pattern of
  coin clinks into the machine, increase the price by 25 cents after every tenth
  clink.
  <b>Decrease</b> the
  price when <img src="vm_contents2.jpg" width="425" height="232" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >disgruntled customers start walking away and there are fewer sales,
  or your internal balance  register indicates a steady sequence of violent
  blows or determined kicks.</p>
<p>In <i>Why We Buy,</i>  CEO
  and Envirosell, Inc. founder Paco Underhill describes the vending machines
  of tomorrow. Nearly one-fifth of all Americans will be 65 or older by the year
  2025, necessitating drastic changes in the way businesses
  conduct automated transactions. The failing eyes and arthritic fingers of senior
  citizens have already forced vending machines to adapt. Large, rectangular
  buttons which dispense cans of Mountain Dew are growing <b>larger,</b> much
  easier to push, and they're increasingly self-illuminated -- preferably with
  enormous photographs of the desired product in question. <i>How much money
  did I just put in? What am I buying again? Where am I?</i> Innovations in vending
  machine user interfaces translate directly into other devices, too. ATMs will
  need to grow phatter, doper, and more pimped-out in an effort to woo seniors.
  The buttons on mobile phones and TiVo remotes will be similarly big-boned,
  growing more <img src="vm_senior.jpg" width="300" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left">colorful
  with each passing year and taking advantage of embedded liquid crystal displays
  suitable for "dim lighting conditions," even though
  it's high noon and the sun is directly overhead. </p>
<p>Who will stock these machines of the future? Anne
  Rawland Gabriel, author of <i>Start
    Your Own Vending Business, </i>chronicles a newer, hipper demographic
  of vending machine operators mysteriously referred
    to as those belonging to  <i>Generations
  X and Y.</i> Unlike the technology industry,
  where "innovation makes millionaires overnight," Gabriel reminds
  us that today's v-commerce entrepreneurs must actively pursue cost control,
  aggressive marketing, exceptional management, and just plain hard work. On
  page five, one can experience an interactive sidebar containing this <b>Fun
  Fact:</b> <i>Generation
  Xers are big consumers of hand-held foods!</i> </p>
<p><img src="vm_urn.gif" width="300" height="391" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Yes, it
  all started way back in <i>Generation G,</i> when in 215 B.C. an enterprising
  young lad named Hero from Alexandria published <i>Pneumatic -- </i> a modest
  collection of blueprints containing some of the craziest devices the world
  had ever seen. One contraption was a specialized, self-contained <b>urn,</b> which
  actually squirted <b>holy water</b> whenever a patron of the church inserted
  a coin. It was simple gravity-based lever system: the weight of a single coin
  would angle a funneled pan forward and down, splashing God's  cool liquid
refreshment directly into your waiting lap. Talk about a <b>time saver.</b></p>
<p>Sadly, Hero's whimsical invention couldn't discern real
  coins from fake ones, leading to inevitable <b>thefts</b> of the blessed water
  by Roman officials and copper-pinching church goers. He died without ever seeing
  his invention evolve from a sacred fountain to the full-on <b>dirty
  French postcard mini-kiosk</b> the  18th century would soon be clamoring for.
  In the 1880s, when patents were secured for a smattering of mechanical counterfeit
  coin detectors, the porn industry <i>really</i> took off. Vending machines
  were there, man -- <b>right</b> there -- riding bareback in History's sidesaddle,
  selling snuffs and tobaccos, slinging dirty books, and even returning exact
  change. <i>Is
  your mind sufficiently blown, earth human?</i></p>

<p>Wait
  -- <i>woah</i> -- time for a science break, Bill Nye. How are vending
  machines
  "intelligent" enough to tell a bona fide American quarter from say,
  a Chuck E. Cheese token? A number of ways, thanks to the aeronautical innovators
  at the <i>Honeywell</i> corporation. They've been making precision electromagnetical
  switches and sensors for fifty years! In the early days, your coin might roll
  down a <b>chute,</b> triggering a rocking balance beam if it were above or
  below a certain weight. A penny would slide one direction, a commemorative
  Betsy Ross quarter-sized silver dollar another. By inserting more
  and more change, the tilting platform would direct each coin into a series
  of pre-sized holes. They'd be sorted in tubes until you'd contributed enough
  weight toward the purchase of a fifty-cent fuck book.</p>
<p><b>Slugs </b>(a nickname for fake coins) might tilt the rocking arm so
  far forward that the washer you stole from Home Depot goes rolling right out
  the coin return! These internal components are now sufficiently advanced enough
  to validate inserted objects based on physical properties like magnetic content,
  and wise enough to "see through" coins which are stained or dirty.
  By using infrared emitting diodes, system-critical <i>optoelectronic</i> sensors
  caress the entire surface of the coin to approximate its physical appearance
  and denomination. It's just the <i>magic of robots.</i></p></td></tr></table>
<p><img src="vm_hardart.jpg" width="381" height="295" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Whoever
  said the warmest, most memorable meals in life are those prepared with loving
  human hands probably never experienced the <b>gumball,</b> a
prime staple of vending machines since 1888. The
  Thomas Adams Gum Company was the first to market  <i>Tutti-Fruiti</i> in kiosks
installed upon the elevated subway platforms of New York City.</p>
<p>Less than a decade later, a completely coin-operated restaurant, or <i><b>automat</b></i>  opened
  in Philadelphia. Joseph Horn and Frank Hardart imagined a <i>Utopian world
  without waitresses,</i> where for three nickels and the squeezy jerk of a big
  fat knob, machines would serve customers classic recipes like Macaroni &
  Cheese, Boston Baked Beans, and creamed spinach. These diners were  staffed
  by human beings, too -- unseen cooks in the back kitchen who prepared the
  hot entrees. Coffee exchangers were also employed: they discarded coffee which
  had been brewing in the urns every twenty minutes, and replaced it
  with a fresh batch. The throw-it-out-after-twenty-minutes rule
  would later be adopted by Starbucks Coffee. </p>
<p><img src="vm_darkcity2.jpg" width="500" height="214" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >It's estimated that the Horn & Hardart New York and Philadelphia
  franchise vended to 800,000 people each day, until it finally
  closed in 1962. New York's last vending machine restaurant was replaced in
  1991 with a Burger King. The cafe was later recreated in stunning
  technicolor for the 1998 science fiction mystery <i>Dark City.</i> </p>
<p>So clearly, it's only a matter of time before vending machines learn how to
  stock themselves with smaller, self-replicated automats capable of dispensing
  the most dangerous snack treat of all -- <b><i>MAN!!</i> </b>Seriously people,
  have we learned nothing from <i>The
Matrix?</i></p>
<p><img src="vm_stuckkidsm.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >A <i>Piggly Wiggly</i> thrift store in Sheboygan, Wisconsin is probably about
  as fun as it sounds -- unless you climb inside their joystick-operated, crane-based
  vending machine like 7-year-old Timothy Novotny did in 2004. He crawled in
  through an opening no larger than an 8.5 x 11" piece of plain white printer
  paper -- but when he tried to get out, he discovered the entrance was blocked.
  Locksmiths, rescuers, and firefighters alike worked for over an hour, moving
  the vending machine to the back of the store away from public view, and out
  behind the main loading dock. <b>The Boy Who Wanted A Toy,</b> quipped the <i>WKMG
  Local6 Headline News</i>. Classic! </p>
<p>Less than a year later, three-year-old  James
  Manges of Elkhart, Indiana managed to climb up the chute of another popular
  claw-style vending machine at <a href="/library/crime/corporate/wal-mart/">Wal-Mart</a>, <img src="vm_kid2.jpg" width="282" height="211" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >where he sat like the Lion King among
  the plush animals for several hours. His 22-year-old mother Danielle, initially
  amused, grew frantic when Wal-Mart employees confessed they couldn't find a
  key to the machine and there was no way to get him out. "He climbed up the
  chute and into the bin," Danielle
  told<i> WNDU
  NewsCenter16</i> reporter
  Robert Borrelli. "He was playing with all the toys and hanging from the
  bar like a monkey." </p>
<p>The Elkhart fire department was called to the
  scene. "I expected his hand to be caught in the machine," officer Anthony Coleman
  admitted. "But it was his entire body."</p>
<p><img src="vm_kid.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right" >James' mother was  ordered by a judge to attend parenting classes. She insists
  her son has done things like this before: climbing out of his playpen, escaping
  from doors and even leaping from windows. So has her husband
  James: he was taken into custody shortly after police were
  called to the scene of a warehouse robbery. He was discovered in possession
  of gloves, a flashlight, two screwdrivers and a hatchet. <b>The Man Who Wanted
  To Rob And Rape And Dismember You In The Dark,</b> quipped the <i>WKMG
  Local6 Headline News.</i> Classic! </p>
<p>In the latter half of the twentieth century, vending machines <b>began to
    rebel</b>  for the first time against their flesh-and-bone masters. Since
    1978, over 50 people have been killed by vending machines  -- and
    over 100 severely injured. Quebec, 1998: Kevin Mackle, 21, while demonstrating
    his unconditional love for a vending machine by <b>hugging
  it</b> back
  and forth in a rocking, tilting fashion, was <i>crushed to death </i> when
  the machine toppled over, squishing him <img src="vm_ass.jpg" width="355" height="266" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >beneath
  its enormous rectangular weight.</p>
<p>When a vending machine falls on top of you, it's responding more out
  of fear than fury. It's saying <b>please stop.</b> It pins you to the linoleum
  floor almost immediately, forcing you to squint into the  overhead fluorescent
  lights. Your elbows and knees are unable to bend or pivot in any direction,
  as if you've been placed in a small coffin. It's very likely your head hit
  the ground <i>pretty hard</i> upon
  impact. If the tilt-over was a clean 90-degree sweep, your
  nose, such as it is, is bent, or your cheeks are pressed firmly against the
  display window. If the machine topples and torques around one of its protective
  rubber footpads, skewing slightly at an angle, the top corner digs an <b>enormous
  diagonal gash</b> across
  your entire body from head to toe. </p>
<p> If the front panel is made of glass, consider yourself lucky:
  it might easily shatter against the floor. If that happens, and you
  don't immediately start bleeding to death, <img src="vm_snacks.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >your
  ribcage will be allowed <b>inside</b> the
  machine -- just inches from the Corn Nuts -- where your lungs can mercifully
  expand and contract several additional cubic millimeters while your friends
  prepare their digital cameras. </p>
<p>Mr. Mackle's surviving family sued the <a href="/library/culture/cola-wars/">Coca-Cola</a> Company for $665,000. They
  also sued the manufacturer of the machine, the California-based <i>Vendo</i> company,
  claiming they knew the machine could tip over easily but did nothing to warn
  consumers. Then they sued
  <i>Beaver Foods,</i> the operator and caretakers of the machine, who had observed
  students at Quebec University rocking the machine back and forth
  numerous times, ignoring the warning placard: <b>TIPPING OR ROCKING MAY
  CAUSE INJURY AND DEATH. </b></p>
<p>Indeed, rather than pay attention to a vending machine's plaintive warning,
  some online content producers are happy just <b>taking a picture of it</b> for
  the purposes of making their <i>LiveJournal</i> experiences  more immersive. <i>See
  the funny guy? He's dead.</i></p>

<p><img src="vm_bonk.jpg" width="740" height="300" vspace="5"></p>

<p><i><img src="vm_trash.jpg" width="360" height="291" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >"I've rocked the machine. A couple times, at least.
    Not a Coke machine, but those nosh boxes that hold fatal snacks on metal
    corkscrew clips all in a row. Sometimes the machine takes your money & won't
    completely detach the snack bag. Pull the machine back toward you from the
  top, shake a bit, the bag drops, and you get what you paid for."</i></p>
<p>Good luck with that, randomly Googled blogger. Vending  machine deaths have
  sparked a bloody war between man and machine, seemingly with no end in sight.
  Recent battles include the Palos Verdes Peninsula High School massacre of March,
  2004 -- where <i>eleven</i> vending
  machines were tormented and executed without explanation. No groups have come
  forward to claim credit for the destruction, although custodian Ben Paule's
  sense of victory was palpable: "The
  repair for the vending machines is not in our hands. The Coca-Cola Company
  has to come in, fix them, calculate the cost of repair, and restock them."</p>
<p> According to principal Kelly Johnson,
  the machines were killed sometime between 1:00am and 3:00am. Someone
  came in during the middle of the night and damaged the money slots on the
  vending machines, possibly with a butane torch.   </p>
<p>Neither  Honeywell engineers nor disgruntled high school students can ever
  equal the ingenuity of vending machines' most formidable opponent: <b>little
  birds.</b> After
  a coin-operated <i>Magic
  Wand</i> car
  wash in Fredericksburg, Virginia was coming up several hundred dollars short
  each week, manager Bill Dougherty suspected his employees of sharing pass-keys
  amongst themselves to steal quarters.</p>
<p><img src="vm_bird2.jpg" width="450" height="331" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Dougherty set up a surveillance camera which monitored the coin device from
  a safe distance, and quickly discovered a host of <i>starlings</i> -- birds
  attracted to shiny objects -- working as a team to commit petty theft. For
  the purposes of nesting or attracting a mate, the starlings would conspire
  together: one would fly up the machine to shake coins loose, the other would
  clamp two or three quarters together between her beak and zip back to base.
  When fellow starlings saw where the coins were coming from, they flew in packs
  to the car wash and duplicated her behavior. <i>Fly! Fly back to school, little
  Starling! </i>Quid pro quo Clarice, etcetera and <b>so forth.</b></p>
<p>Well, that wraps it up for this episode of <i>The World of Tomorrow
  Today</i>. In the meanwhile, it's safe to say that whether you like vending
  machines or hate them, the future is finally here
  to stay -- forever and ever. Now if only some young Einstein could  daydream
  up a way to put shampoo <i>and</i> conditioner
in the <b>same plastic bottle! </b></p>
