<h1>SpongeBob SquarePants</h1>
<p>Between 1999 and 2002, the number of people taping or <a href="/library/culture/tivo/">TiVo</a>-ing <i>SpongeBob 
  SquarePants</i> off Nickelodeon eclipsed those recording <i><a href="/library/culture/south-park/">South Park</a></i> 
  and <i><a href="/library/culture/the-simpsons/">The Simpsons</a></i> put together. Rarely has an animated cartoon series 
  intended for toddlers aged two-to-eleven so nimbly insinuated itself into the 
  American public meme, or caused so many problems for parents, media corporations 
  and race relations. The show has inspired over $800 million worth of merchandise 
  since its inception, and SpongeBob's porous, yellow face beams optimistically 
  from the number-one selling brands of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Band-Aid bandages, 
  and frozen fruit juice popsicles.</p>
<p><img src="spongebob-3.jpg" width="160" height="197" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Early 
  on, the creative force behind <i>SpongeBob</i> came to include <i>Underworld</i> 
  cartoonist Kaz and Sam <i>"Magic Whistle"</i> Henderson, both of whom 
  wrote and storyboarded numerous episodes in their own superb, trademark styles. 
  SpongeBob himself is voiced by standup comedian and <i>Mr. Show</i> veteran 
  Tom Kenny, who served time as the Announcer and Mayor characters on <i>The Powerpuff 
  Girls.</i> Mister Krabs is voiced by Clancy Brown, the looming prison guard 
  from <i>The Shawshank Redemption </i>-- the one Andy Dufresne assists with his 
  income taxes. Squidward is voiced by Rodger Bumpass, who's been doing voices 
  for cartoons since <i>The Jetsons</i> in 1962. Guest stars have included <i>Match 
  Game</i> regular <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/charles-nelson-reilly/">Charles Nelson Reilly</a>, Ernest Borgnine, Tim Conway, John Lurie 
  and director Jim Jarmusch -- all of whom share the cartoon stage with the musical 
  stylings of Tiny Tim, Ween, and Pantera. Among its loyal fans: Dennis Miller, 
  Bruce Willis, Tom Waits and <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/comic/jerry-lewis/">Jerry Lewis</a>.</p>
<p>Troubling <i>SpongeBob</i> "incidents" are ever present, and can strike even 
  the sleepiest of communities without warning. On April 12, 2003, sheriff's deputies 
  were called to the El Paso Coliseum in Texas after hundreds of parents and children 
  stormed from the palace during an ice follies, demanding their money back. They 
  claimed that SpongeBob had been expected to <b>star</b> in the show, but in 
  fact he was only a small part of the ice-skating exhibition. The furor disgraced 
  the ice skating exhibition, and to this day local politicians continue to invoke 
  memories of the "SpongeBob Riots" during election campaigns.</p>
<p><img src="spongebob.jpg" width="250" height="333" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><img src="dan-spongebob.jpg" width="200" height="172" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The 
  half-hour program is an amalgamation of traditional cel animation, live action 
  puppet shows, digitized video elements and computer enhanced cinematography. 
  Musically, the soundtrack consists of pitch-shifted, tiki Hawaiian cues. It 
  targets a generation of youngsters without an immediate awareness of <i><a href="/library/culture/monty-python/">Monty Python</a>'s Flying Circus</i> on PBS or the original Warner Bros. <i>Merrie Melodies</i> 
  <a href="/library/culture/banned-cartoons/">cartoons</a>.</p>
<p>It tickles children of all ages by catering to their developing capacities 
  for abstract thought, providing existential underwater situations (hereinafter 
  referred to as "nautical nonsense") and fully fleshed-out supporting 
  characters like Squidward Tentacles, Patrick Star, Sandy Cheeks, and Eugene 
  H. Krabs. Think of the cast and crew as contemporary child development specialists 
  who prepare young people for an artistically sound and socially adjusted life 
  by encouraging them to act out whatever surreal fantasies they choose.</p>
<p>While <i>Dora</i> is off exploring friendship and multicultural melting pots, 
  while <i>Dexter</i> beats off into a laboratory test tube, as <i>The Powerpuff 
  Girls</i> deconstruct threadbare id/ego/superego subdivisions of the blonde 
  bimbos, red-headed control freaks and indignant, dykeified brunettes within 
  us all, SpongeBob and his colleagues skirt conventional narrative structures 
  by staying home, indulging themselves in unique hobbies and isolated personal 
  pursuits. SpongeBob blows bubbles out the window of his private pineapple-shaped 
  home <img src="bio_hillenburg.jpg" width="250" height="318" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">overlooking 
  <img src="hugs.jpg" width="193" height="248" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">the 
  sea floor of Bikini Bottom. Or he sits in a box and plays pretend. Or he goes 
  "jellyfishing" with a butterfly net, capturing undulating sea creatures 
  and squirting the jam from their stinging tentacles onto slices of white bread 
  for lunch. And he's not one of those "how does this guy manage to stay 
  alive" type characters, either: he supports himself by working a regular 
  job as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab restaurant. SpongeBob pays his rent, goes 
  to school to learn how to drive a boat, and takes care of his pet Gary: a sea 
  snail whose emotions are conveyed exclusively through the squeaks and meows 
  of a contented house cat. In Bikini Bottom, educational television is widely 
  regarded as punishment.</p>
<p><img src="dirtbike.jpg" width="189" height="311" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">The 
  creator of SpongeBob, Stephen Hillenburg, earned his degree in 1984: in "natural 
  resource planning and interpretation," with an emphasis in marine resources. 
  He taught marine biology at the Orange County Marine Institute in California, 
  where he noticed his young students' enthusiasm for the creatures which live 
  in tide pools: sponges, starfish, octopi and crabs, chief among them. While 
  pitching his idea for Nickelodeon, he played the <img src="duh.jpg" width="169" height="233" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">ukulele 
  and sang a version of the theme song.</p>
<p> "At first I drew a few natural sponges -- amorphous shapes, blobs -- 
  which was the correct thing to do biologically as a marine science teacher," 
  he told the Washington Post. "Then I drew a square sponge and it looked 
  so funny. A funny, nerdy, squeaky-clean square. I think as far as cartoon language 
  goes he was easier to recognize. He seemed to fit the character type I was looking 
  for." </p>
<p>It's true: <i>SpongeBob</i> is currently the most dangerous weapon in the Viacom 
  media sea. Nine million satellite subscribers lost access to SpongeBob during 
  a dispute with EchoStar, owner of the Dish Network. All Viacom had to do was 
  yank <i>SpongeBob</i>, MTV's <i>The Real World</i>, and <i>Survivor</i> from 
  millions of viewers in Los Angeles, New York and Miami to demonstrate their 
  power of positive thinking. After a two-day blackout, Viacom secured everything 
  it wanted from EchoStar, including a <b>rate increase</b> of six cents per month, 
  per subscriber.</p>
<p><img src="sponge.jpg" width="250" height="244" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">In 
  a show of disdain, work-released inmates from the Montgomery County Jail in 
  Norristown, Pennsylvania smuggled drugs into their prison by way of <i>SpongeBob</i> 
  cards and stickers containing small packets of heroin.</p>
<p>Some of these stickers were the same ones protested by flabbergasted <a href="/library/crime/corporate/wal-mart/">Wal-Mart</a> 
  patrons in March of 2004, when a printing error led to the publication of a 
  Valentine's Day greeting card featuring a <b>black</b> SpongeBob SquarePants. 
</p>
<p>Officials at the American Greetings Corporation felt deeply humiliated and 
  "fell out of their chairs" when they saw the printed images leering 
  back at them from store shelves: SpongeBob with his trademark big teeth and 
  wide eyes, looking suspiciously like the offensive images of African-Americans 
  portrayed in minstrel shows from decades past.</p>
<p>"Culturally, the guys on press in China wouldn't have the faintest idea 
  of who a SpongeBob was or who a black SpongeBob was," said David Blinderman, 
  director of global product development. Wal-Mart stores offered refunds.</p>
<p><i><img src="Cleo_a.jpg" width="400" height="261" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The 
  Spongebob Squarepants Theme Song</i>, heard at the opening of every show, invites 
  children to sing along with an oil rendering of "Painty the Pirate," 
  a framed portrait with a cutaway human mouth like the kind observed during fake 
  interviews on <i>Late Night with Conan O'Brien</i>. The paining was done by 
  <img src="liang.jpg" width="98" height="138" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Chinese 
  artist <b>Calvin Liang,</b> who graduated from the Shanghai Academy of Fine 
  Arts -- one of China's most prestigious and competitive art academies. 
  Liang designed sets for operas and musical dramas for the Canton Opera Institute 
  before emigrating to the United States in 1987, where he continued his profession 
  as a full-time artist developing visuals for Walt Disney Studios and Nickelodeon.</p>
<p>Painty the Pirate, Tony Millionaire's <i>Maakies</i>, and the Sea Captain from 
  <i>The Simpsons</i> were an unstoppable triumvirate of motivating forces responsible 
  for the surge of pirate enthusiasm among culture-starved twentysomethings during 
  2000 and early 2001. <img src="lores.jpg" width="416" height="281" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">This 
  in turn led to a swelling of popular seafaring phrases like "Arrrrrrr" 
  (which quickly grew as tiresome as "Whassup??") and served as the 
  precursor to salted popcorn snack treats like Pirate's Booty. Our nation's passing 
  fancy with Seinfeldian puffy shirts, swashbuckling foppery, and our tepid predilection 
  for pegged legs mercifully hit the skids with the release of feature films like 
  <i>The Pirates of the Carribean</i> and <i>Master and Commander</i>, which showed 
  audiences around the world that life at sea could also be excruciatingly insipid 
  without immediate access to the buttplug-shaped TiVo remote. Watch for a resurgence 
  of nautical themes in another three years or so, now that every marketing team 
  in the entertainment business knows what rattles the viewer's crossbones.</p>
<p>Early in 2002, homosexual rumors persisted as SpongeBob reached the upper echelon 
  of status in the gay community. In numerous episodes, he's observed holding 
  hands and promenading (yes, actually skipping and prancing) around the town 
  square with his best friend and neighbor Patrick Star. Not even Squidward Tentacles 
  escaped the controversy, as mounting anecdotal evidence pointed toward his fondness 
  for classical music, practicing the clarinet, and taking long bubblebaths. As 
  a result, novelty shops catering to gay <img src="anon.jpg" width="346" height="260" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">clientele 
  in New York and Atlanta regularly experience difficulty keeping <i>SpongeBob</i> 
  memorabilia in stock.</p>
<p>Tom Kenny skirted the issue on <i>Late Night with Conan O'Brien</i>: "Whether 
  [SpongeBob] is intended to be a gay character or not, it's never been addressed 
  by us on the show." He went on to add that all the main characters are 
  hiding "horrible secrets" of their own. Meanwhile, a different (but 
  equally horrific) urban legend swept elementary schools across the nation: that 
  a retarded child drowned while trying to reach SpongeBob's pineapple-shaped 
  house under the sea. </p>
<p> In January 2004, a single-sphered SpongeBob SquarePants balloon traveled over 
  800 miles at a height of 10,000 feet from Central Mexico to southeast Texas, 
  thirty miles southwest of Houston. There was a note attached, wishing the recipient 
  a merry Christmas. Fort Bend County Office of Emergency Management Staff Meteorologist 
  Ron Stagno announced the balloon probably made the journey in two days.</p></p>
