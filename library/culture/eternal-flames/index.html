TO ELVIS IN MEMORIUM
<p>

You gave yourself to each of us in<br>
some manner. You were wrapped in<br>
thoughtfulness and tied with love.<br>
May this flame reflect our never<br>
ending respect and love for you.<br>
May it serve as a constant reminder<br>
to each of us of your eternal presence.
</font></tt></center>

<blockquote><i>
We all went to Graceland and went to Elvis's grave and next to the grave there was a plastic box with rainwater in it. I asked a security guard what it was and he said it "was the eternal flame." We mentioned that it wasn't burning, and he said "It's a semi-eternal flame." The spirit of the song was inspired there. Blame it on Elvis.</i><br>
