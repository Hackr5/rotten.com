<h1>Sideshow</h1>

Before video transmissions enabled the conveyance of freakery world-wide, and before we understood (generally) that bizzare monsters didn't lurk in every corner and within every forest, the world was a scary place. Sometimes we bled and didn't understand why, and other times we'd happen across a person with a strange ailment and think it was the work of spirits or from a strange sin. But while we didn't know <i>why</i> it all happened, we still wanted to <i>see it</i>. And it wasn't that hard for someone to figure out that if he came upon a person with an obvious defect, others might <i>pay money</i> to see it.
<p>

Thus was born the Freak Show, a display of human (and non-human) grotesquery that travelled the countryside, offering a glimpse at what we might otherwise never see, or want to see.
