<h1>Animal Hoarding</h1>

"Cat Lady" is a specific term, only appropriate to describe elderly women who maintain a feline surplus. But what if it's a collection of dogs? Or rabbits? Or some kind of mixture? What if it's even a man? Obviously, none of those people are cat ladies. Thus, the term "Animal Hoarder" was coined.
<p>

Lots of people are driven by a desire to rescue stray and unwanted critters. But this impulse is perverted in the mind of the animal hoarder, whose obsessive-compulsive disorder causes limitless collecting. They simply can't stop taking in animals, even after the population has far outgrown the hoarder's ability to feed, house, or medically treat them. Invariably, the eventual result is a cross between Dr. Doolittle's house and <a href="/library/conspiracy/american-concentration-camps/">Andersonville Prison</a>.
