<h1>Eccentrics</h1>

Eccentricity, we like to say, is the rich-man's crazy. Nobody likes the scary crazy, where it is a personal threat to life and limb to have the afflicted within arm's reach of us. But when there seems to be a little knock in the gears, a slight hiccup in the thought process, we often take a light-hearted look at it, and in fact consider it a sign of life's rich pageant. Whether these little mental oddities lead to dangerous situations or horrifying conditions down the road is not our immediate concern. We just motion to our dates and snicker as we go back to our warm, normal homes.

For example, you can't do better than to learn about the reign of <a href="/library/bio/royalty/america/emperor-norton/">Emperor Norton</a>, the first emperor of the United States.</p>
