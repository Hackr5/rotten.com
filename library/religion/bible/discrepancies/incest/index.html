<h1>Incest in the Bible</h1>
<P>

<blockquote>
"Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of this mother..."<br>
<i>Deuteronomy 27:22</i>
<P>

"And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter...it is a wicked thing...."<br>
<i>Leviticus 20:17</i>
</blockquote>
<P>

Yet Abraham <a href="/library/sex/incest/">marries his father's daughter</a> and remains God's favorite:
<p>

<blockquote>
"And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife."<br>
<i>Genesis 20:11-12</i>
</blockquote>
