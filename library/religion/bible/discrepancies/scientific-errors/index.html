<h1>Scientific Errors In The Bible</h1>

Here are but a few:
<P>

<UL>

<li><B>Insects with four feet?</b>
<blockquote>
"Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth; Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.  But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you."<br>
<i>Leviticus 11:21-23</i>
</blockquote>
<p>

Just for the record, insects have six feet and arachnids have eight.  You'd think the ancient Israelites might have picked up on this little detail, what with eating locusts and beetles and all.
<P>

<li><B>Bats identified as "birds"?</b>

<blockquote>
"And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, and the vulture, and the kite after his kind; Every raven after his kind; and the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, and the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and <b>the bat</b>."
<br>
<i>Leviticus 11:13-19</i>
</blockquote>
<P>
An almost identical passage occurs in <i>Deuteronomy 14:11-18</i>. The bat is of course a flying <i>mammal</i>, not a bird.

<li><B>Rabbits claimed to chew their cud?</b>
<P>
<blockquote>"And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you."
<BR>
<i>Leviticus 11:6</i>
</blockquote>
<P>
To chew the cud means to eat grasses, swallow, then <a href="/library/medicine/bodily-functions/vomiting/">regurgitate</a> later for further chewing.  Rabbits simply do not do this.  However, rabbits do eat their own poo, in order to absorb certain nutrients that passed through unabsorbed the first time.  This is similar to human <a href="/library/medicine/bodily-functions/pissing/drinking-pee/">urine drinking</a>.
</ul>
