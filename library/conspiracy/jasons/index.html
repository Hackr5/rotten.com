<h1>Jasons</h1>

<blockquote><tt>
In its 42-year history, no Jason press conference has ever been called. Tape recorders are banned from its sessions. Window blinds are drawn. The <a href=""> (Broken link for CIA)</a> has been among Jason's sponsors. The mood seems akin to the mountain fastness of <a href=""> (Broken link for Los Alamos)</a>, N.M., where some of these scientists haved worked. On rare occasions there have been leaks about hearty laughter, as when one Nobel laureate arrived in La Jolla with his foot in a cast, explaining that when his trash compactor broke down, he decided the scientific solution was to kick it.
<p>

Jasons named themselves for the mythological Greek who captured the Golden Fleece. Their roster descends from the ultrasecret Manhattan Project of World War II, within which scientists built the <a href="/library/history/atomic-bomb/">Atomic Bomb</a> and forced the surrender of Japan.
