<h1>Kid Marketing </h1>

<p>Children are like <a href="/library/sex/rape/date-rape/">date rapists</a>:
  they have to be told repeatedly that <b>no means no.</b> Because concepts like
  parental respect have grown so inexplicably abstract, the average preadolescent
   continues nagging his parents upwards of nine times for a desired product.
   Twelve and thirteen year olds -- the group most targeted by advertisers --
   nag their parents more than <b>fifty times,</b> continuing their unrelenting
   campaigns of harassment for weeks at a time. <i>Can we have a pool, dad? Can
   we have a pool, dad? </i>When delivered
   by a parent, phrases like "no, we will not take you to Mount Splashmore" feel
   less like big red stop signs and more like invitations for continued debate.</p>
<p>In children's marketing circles, this technique is referred to as <i>pester
    power,</i>  or the <b>Nag
  Factor</b> --
  not to be confused with the popular pornographic DVD franchise <i>Gag Factor</i>.
  The <i>Initiative Media</i> firm acknowledges that  <b>fifty percent</b> of
  all toy purchases would never have been rung up in a million years had it not
  been for the sweet, wailing nags of a child. That's fifty percent across <b>every
  conceivable category </b>relating
  to children:   toy
  purchases, trips to fast food restaurants, vacations to amusement parks --
  even automotive sales. Car companies offering vehicles with DVD players
  aren't selling to mom and dad, they're delivering  coded messages of nagging
  hope exclusively to the <a href="/library/culture/spongebob/">Spongebob</a> set, those who can't last more than five
  minutes without audiovisual stimulation. <i><img src="km_range.jpg" width="445" height="255" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" /></i>According
  to the <i>Center for Science in
  the Public Interest,</i> nagging works best on four specific classes of parents:</p>
<p>1. <i><b>Bare-Necessities Parents.</b></i> Mom and dad (e.g. Frasier and
  Lilith Crane) are upscale and affluent, with a two-story house or greater,
  and at least two cars. One or both has a college degree and graduate work.
  They are intelligent, and on average more or less resistant to whining. The
  only successful nag will be the value-added "importance" nag under the
  guise of a more sophisticated motive. <i>But
  I need it to finish my <b>science experiment,</b></i> or: <i>I need to own
  the <u>complete</u> set of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. </i></p>
<p>2. <i><b>Let's Be Pals Parents.</b></i> (e.g. the mom on <i>Gastineau Girls</i>)
  Mom and dad are much younger parents -- too young to know what the fuck they're
  doing. Typically they'll buy video games and Playstations as much for themselves
  as for their children, while everybody wanders around the house wearing Hello
  Kitty pajamas and planning a Renaissance fair. Not much hardcore nagging is
  required in these families, just add <img src="km_babies.jpg" width="250" height="205" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >your
  shit to their shopping list. If mom or dad are employed, pray they can cling
  to their tech support jobs. </p>
<p>3. <i><b>Indulging Parents.</b></i> (e.g. any parent you've seen on <i>Intervention</i>)
  Mom and dad are working class parents with very little time or extra spending
  money. Fast food and toys become transitory substitutes for love, discipline,
  or home-cooked meals together at the table. Here, nagging sends a message: <i>my
  child needs something, and buying it will temporarily push away guilt.</i></p>
<p>4. <i><b>Conflicted Parents.</b></i> (e.g. any celebrity parent) Mom and dad
  have no idea what to buy for their kids, and actually find advertising a resource.
  At times, they have sneaking suspicions that they really <i>shouldn't</i> take
  their child to Chuck E. Cheese three times a week, but -- <i>eh</i> --
  what are you gonna do. It happens, and it makes the nagging go away, at least
  for awhile. </p>
<p><img src="km_loonatics0zo.jpg" width="450" height="246" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >Cartoon
  characters serving as brand mascots provide a quick and easy band-aid to an
  otherwise uninspired youth label. Colonel Sanders raps and spits into a drumstick-shaped
  microphone about eleven herbs and <i>spizices. </i>Ronald
  McDonald pops and breakdances in circles around a freshly-scrubbed
  rainbow of multicultural children who sit there <i>lovin'
  it. </i>An updated, ostensibly "edgier" Bugs
  Bunny turns his baseball cap inside-out. Fat Albert's ringtone wants to know
  Where You At. Donald Duck sports ever-blingier ba-bling, and Mickey Mouse
  looks more and more like those Tasmanian Devil pimps you see
  in cheap tattoo parlors. Even Apple Computer's operating system is branded
  with a goddamn smiley face. Kids use icons, SMS shorthand and text messaging
  in lieu of more complicated concepts like complete words and sentences sculpted
  into structured conversation, and who better to push that agenda then a <a href="/library/medicine/corn/">Trix
rabbit</a> clutching a <a href="/library/crime/drugs/sugar/">Twix bar</a>?</p>
<p><i>Eightball</i> cartoonist Daniel Clowes and<i> Black Hole</i> cartoonist
  Charles Burns <i><img src="km_oksoda.jpg" width="102" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" /></i>lightly tiptoed into teen marketing on a global scale when they
  designed artwork for a line of <i>Coca-Cola</i> drinks. Named after the most
  recognized word in any language -- the second being "Coke" -- 
  <i><b>OK Soda</b></i> was a short-lived brand keenly aimed at what passed for
  the "Generation X" demographic in early 1994. The brand was one of
  the earlie<img src="km_OK.jpg" width="144" height="259" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >st to capitalize on the idea that young people were -- what's the
  word? Disillusioned? Disenfranchised. Disaffected? How about <b>disinterested.</b>  The
  labels were great, the soda was terrible, and less than a year later the cans
  were yanked from shelves. To this day, The OK Soda legacy remains one of the
  most transparent, desperate and ridiculous youth campaigns ever made by <a href="/library/culture/cola-wars/">Big Cola</a>.</p>
<p><i>"Children nowadays are tyrants. They contradict their parents, gobble
  their food, and tyrannize their teachers." -- Socrates, 425 B.C. </i></p>
<p>Kid marketing? Sounds like a retarded DJ name. Children aren't burdened
  with mortgages, rent, groceries or basic utilities -- unless mom or dad is
  makin' them pitch in. They're a highly lucrative market, with a spending power
  greater than the gross national product of countries like Finland, Portugal
  and Greece.</p>
<p><i>Teen Research Unlimited</i> is an Illinois mar<img src="km_mm.jpg" width="221" height="275" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >keting think tank which has
  interviewed over a million teenagers. They've conservatively estimated
  that teens in 2006 would spend upwards of $159 billion of their own money and
  their parents' money combined. Teens need jobs, but as a result of our upside-down
  economy, adult workers around the country are clinging desperately to all the
  decent entry-level service positions. Teenage unemployment is at an all time
  high, and rising <b>gas
  prices</b> means
  that while an unprecedented cache of teen dollars might be temporarily flowing
  directly into gas tanks, kids can't drive all the way to and from the <i><img src="km_kfc-colonel.jpg" width="200" height="175" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" ></i>Apple
  store as often as they'd like. <i>Ninety-nine cents for a  <b>song?</b> Fuck
  that noise, I'll LimeWire it. Christ on the cross, it sucks anyway. Trash can. </i>Weirdly,
  today's incoming crop of teens are reportedly devoted to bizarre concepts like
  God and
  their own
  mothers -- in that order.</p>
<p>The number one reason couples remain in love is not that
  they <i>like</i> the same things -- but that they <b>hate</b> the same things.
  A brand wishing to successfully exploit a long-term relationship with a
  child must closely align itself with a similar premise. Find out what the kid
  hates, and then make fun of it. There is nothing more annoying to an avant-garde
  teen than being told he's <b>on the cutting edge,</b> as he genuinely believes
  himself to be one hundred percent self-alienated from the social strata. </p>
<p><img src="km_bad.jpg" width="340" height="269" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >When
  a clothing company like <b>Diesel </b>embeds
  anti-advertising messages directly in its print and billboard campaigns, it
  represents a hackneyed paradoxical chestnut which young people
  haven't already seen a million times. When <b>Benetton</b> offers yearly
  catalogs "united in color" featuring cocky, self-confident bumper sticker platitudes
  about sex, religion, and racism alongside images of death-row inmates or handicapped
  children, kids don't immediately recognize that their clothing manufacturer
  is boldly "coming forward" in favor of something nobody ever needs to formulate
  an opinion about. The screaming scraps of press generated from these early
  examples of extreme-to-the-max slabs of kiddie content -- especially when a
  community of uptight parents <a href="/library/sex/group-sex/gang-bang/">gangbangs</a> together in protest -- are ten times
  more valuable than the campaign itself. Gone are the days of <i>adutainment</i> or
  <i>infomercials,</i> as they've since been replaced by  self-aware "controvercials". </p>
<p><b>Calvin Klein</b> claims credit for the most
  successful attempt at thumbing its nose at how square and backwards adults
  can be. In partnership with Warnaco, Inc., CK launched a billboard
  campaign in New York which featured <b><img src="km_ckad.jpg" width="400" height="220" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >semi-naked toddlers</b> posing in tight
  underwear. Public outcry resulted in then-mayor Rudy Guiliani yanking the ads
  straight down -- a real triumph in "numerically
  measurable mainstream accessibility," to quote <i>Channel 101</i> co-founder
  Dan Harmon. It's unclear how many toddlers who saw the CK ad were subsequently
  inspired to tart themselves up a little more. </p>
<p>Okay, okay: the <i>nag</i> factor, the billions dollars' worth of anti-market
  research, the conspiratorial plots to seize and secure innocent young minds
  -- <b>we
  get it.</b> Big fuckin' deal and who cares. Tell
  us something we don't know. Indeed, the most disturbing marketing trend is
  what children's companies find themselves battling now: the <i>duh</i> factor.
  The segment of our population comprised of pre-adolescents up to and including
  age 14 (often referred to mockingly as the <i>tween</i> generation or <i>Millenials)</i>  is
  rapidly losing their predisposition for creativity and imagination. <b>LEGO,</b> a
  company teetering precariously on the premise that kids <b>want</b> to
  be creative, has been struggling with exactly that conundrum for just over
  a decade. As recently as 1990, the standard box of <b><img src="km_ride.jpg" width="404" height="303" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" ></b>LEGO
  bricks contained anywhere from 500 to 1000 pieces. Through sales research,
  focus groups and peer review, LEGO now believes such a set is way, <i>way</i> too
  complex. Let's dial it back a bit: not only do children
  <i>not</i> have the patience to gather together all the required parts for
  a castle, or boat, or car -- there isn't enough <b>space</b> in their tiny,
  ridiculous brains to previsualize long-term plans, imagine new forms, or create
  the requisite custom shapes.</p>
<p>As a response to this trend,  LEGO decreased the number of pieces in each
  box. Instead of grappling with a full one-hundred pieces to build that
  Kentucky Fried Chicken or Starbucks Coffee, now you
  only need ten. And look: these pre-fab green umbrella straws snap directly
  into the miniature espresso machine -- you don't even gotta build 'em. LEGO
  bricks have gotten  <i><b>bigger,</b></i> as
  well: the size of each block in a set has increased steadily over time in
  direct proportion to your child's inability to manipulate his backwards, clumsy-ass
  ham hands. Who needs hours of unnecessarily complicated finger work when
  you're trying to develop your motor skills? </p>
<p>Finally, the majority of "bricks" in today's LEGO kits have evolved exactly
  as Darwin intended: they're now shaped exactly like the cars, trees, humans,
  animals, ships, and <img src="km_lego2.jpg" width="353" height="260" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >rockets
  originally subject to interpretation by a kid's imagination. And which set
  of LEGO is right for you? Choose from styles like
  <i>Harry Potter, Star Wars, Exoforce, Knight's Kingdom, Bionicle,</i> and numerous
  other brandy-brands too depressing even to think about. It's only a matter
  of time before LEGO starts packaging their product directly inside the Happy
  Meal carton.</p>
<p>The only thing more retarded might be those among us in pursuit of
  a LEGO <i>Mindstorms</i> hobby.
  "Challenging" 
  your child to play with electronic, battery-operated toys and program squiggly
  meta-scripts so his optically sensitive robot greets him at the door with
  a drink after day care is the <b>easiest thing your child will ever do with
  his life.</b> Lock him in a room with 10,000 single-cell plastic bricks, and
  don't let him out until he's successfully constructed the college of his choice.
  It's inevitable that all these trends in teen marketing  continue uninterrupted,
  because there's no <i>end</i> in
  the word <i>trend</i>. Except of course at the end of the word trend.</p>
