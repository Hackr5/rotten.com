<h1>Alien Autopsy</h1>

A foam rubber model of a polydactylic girl with Hutchinson-Gilford disease
and oversized contact lenses was filmed by people working for Ray Santilli, a modern-day P.T. Barnum of sorts, and the absolutely fake Alien Autopsy was shown on Fox television in August of 1995 in a special hosted by a very smirky <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/culture/star-trek/">Johnathan Frakes</a>.  It was almost as if he <i>knew</i> just how bogus this was from the get-go.  Santilli claimed to have found the footage while searching for rare films of <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/music/elvis/">Elvis</a>.<p> 

The film allegedly showed Army scientists autopsying an alien corpse that had been taken from the crash at <a href="/library/conspiracy/roswell/">Roswell</a>.  It also showed footage of parts of the spaceship that crashed.  Allegedly.  An actual eyewitness to Roswell fragments seemed somewhat reluctant to confirm the images on the tapes were the real, but said it was possible.<p>

Despite a carefully edited scene where a bunch of movie special effects artists say how "difficult" (but not impossible) it would be to fake such an event, many movie makers and respectable UFO investigators were immediately repulsed by Santilli's obvious presupposition that the average TV watcher was dumb enough to fall for this shit.  Unfortunately, Santilli's assumption appeared to be right on the mark.<p>

Other than little details -- how the doctors held the scissors, what part of the autopsy was not filmed, the camera angles, and the fact that it was filmed in black-and-white when color was available and certainly would have been made ready for something as important as <b>documenting the autopsy of an <a href="/library/cryptozoology/aliens/">extraterrestrial</a></b> -- the damn thing looked <i>way</i> too human.  The big, black eyes were a nice touch, but the blatantly primate ear, hand, and foot structures (twelve fingers and twelve toes notwithstanding) were dead giveaways.<p>

Since the airing, earlier versions of the video were discovered, including one performed underneath a tent in a barn.  One of the "doctors" was found and forced to confess on yet another Fox special about the World's Greatest Hoaxes.<p>

The <i>real</i> "conspiracy" was Fox network executives trying to legitimize a charlatan to a gullible public for commercial time and video sales of the hoax, only to later admit the whole thing was a big fat lie for more ratings.  But if you ask them about it, they'll probably just say, "We Report, You Decide."<p>
