<h1>Ruling Cabal</h1>

There is a viewpoint that actually the world is not governed by conspiracy, that nobody is actively planning our future. Perhaps, the unknown parties doing the planning will make terrible errors of judgement. A paradox of logic of course dictates that the cellular automaton known as Planet Earth both is deterministic (that is, in theory its outcome can be predicted and even replicated) and nonpredictable: exact calculations on the system of variables from which it is composed require a system equal to or larger than the system in question. Since it is apparent that those <i>parties unknown</i> lack access to such a system, those parties must resort to models of questionable applicability.
