<h1>Report from Davros</h1>

This letter was "leaked" in February 2003. It's not clear if the leak was intentional or not. After the leak, it was posted on <i>Slashdot</i>, as an example of a massive privacy violation. Of course, if the <i>intent</i> was to leak it, this isn't true at all. It could even be a total fabrication, laying it on a bit thick with the namedropping.

Hi Guys.<br>
<br>
OK, hard to believe, but true. Yours truely has been hobnobbing with the<br>
ruling class.<br>
<br>
I spent a week in Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum. I was<br>
awarded a special pass which allowed me full access to not only the<br>
entire official meeting, but also private dinners with the likes the<br>
head of the <a href="/library/history/countries/saudi-arabia/">Saudi</a> Secret Police, presidents of various and sundry<br>
countries, your Fortune 500 CEOS and the leaders of the most important<br>
NGOs in the world. This was not typical press access. It was full-on,<br>
unfettered, class A hobnobbing.<br>
<br>
Davos, I discovered, is a breathtakingly beautiful spot, unlike anything<br>
I'd ever experienced. Nestled high in the Swiss Alps, it's a three hours<br>
train ride from Zurich that finds you climbing steadily through<br>
snow-laden mountains that bring to mind Heidi and Audrey Hepburn (as in<br>
the opening scenes of "Charade"). The EXTREMELY powerful arrive by<br>
helicopter. The moderately powerful take the first class train. The NGOs<br>
and we mere mortals reach heaven via coach train or a conference bus.<br>
Once in Europe's bit of heaven conferees are scattered in hotels that<br>
range from B&B to ultra luxury 5-stars, all of which are located along<br>
one of only three streets that bisect the idyllic village of some 13,000<br>
permanent residents.<br>
<br>
Local Davos folks are fanatic about skiing, and the slopes are literally<br>
a 5-15 minute bus ride away, depending on which astounding downhill you<br>
care to try. I don't know how, so rather than come home in a full body<br>
cast I merely watched.<br>
<br>
This sweet little chalet village was during the WEF packed with about<br>
3000 delegates and press, some 1000 Swiss police, another 400 Swiss<br>
soldiers, numerous tanks and armored personnel carriers, gigantic rolls<br>
of coiled barbed wire that gracefully cascaded down snow-covered<br>
hillsides, missile launchers and assorted other tools of the national<br>
security trade. The security precautions did not, of course, stop there.<br>
Every single person who planned to enter the conference site had special<br>
electronic badges which, upon being swiped across a reading pad,<br>
produced a computer screen filled color portrait of the attendee, along<br>
with his/her vital statistics. These were swiped and scrutinized by<br>
soldiers and police every few minutes -- any time one passed through a<br>
door, basically. The whole system was connected to handheld wireless<br>
communication devices made by HP, which were issued to all VIPs. I got<br>
one. Very cool, except when they crashed. Which, of course, they did<br>
frequently. These devices supplied every imagineable piece of<br>
information one could want about the conference, your fellow delegates,<br>
Davos, the world news, etc. And they were emailing devices --- all<br>
emails being monitored, of course, by Swiss cops.<br>
<br>
Antiglobalization folks didn't stand a chance. Nor did Al Qaeda. After<br>
all, if someone managed to take out Davos during WEF week the world<br>
would basically lose a fair chunk of its ruling and governing class<br>
POOF, just like that. So security was the name of the game. Metal<br>
detectors, X-ray machines, shivering soldiers standing in blizzards,<br>
etc.<br>
<br>
Overall, here is what I learned about the state of our world:<br>
<br>
- I was in a dinner with heads of Saudi and German FBI, plus the<br>
foreign minister of Afghanistan. They all said that at its peak <a href="/library/history/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda/">al Qaeda</a><br>
had 70,000 members. Only 10% of them were trained in terrorism -- the<br>
rest were military recruits. Of that 7000, they say all but about 200<br>
are dead or in jail.<br>
<br>
- But Al Qaeda, they say, is like a brand which has been heavily<br>
franchised. And nobody knows how many unofficial franchises have been<br>
spawned since 9/11.<br>
<br>
- The global economy is in very very very very bad shape. Last year<br>
when WEF met here in <a href="/library/travel/cities/nyc/">New York</a> all I heard was, "Yeah, it's bad, but<br>
recovery is right around the corner". This year "recovery" was a word<br>
never uttered. Fear was palpable -- fear of enormous fiscal hysteria.<br>
The watchwords were "deflation", "long term stagnation" and "collapse of<br>
the dollar". All of this is without war.<br>
<br>
- If the U.S. unilaterally goes to war, and it is anything short of a<br>
quick surgical strike (lasting less than 30 days), the economists were<br>
all predicting extreme economic gloom: falling dollar value, rising spot<br>
market oil prices, the Fed pushing interest rates down towards zero with<br>
resulting increase in national debt, severe trouble in all countries<br>
whose currency is guaranteed agains the dollar (which is just about<br>
everybody except the EU), a near cessation of all development and<br>
humanitarian programs for poor countries. Very few economists or<br>
ministers of finance predicted the world getting out of that economic<br>
funk for minimally five-10 years, once the downward spiral ensues.<br>
<br>
- Not surprisingly, the business community was in no mood to hear about<br>
a war in <a href="/library/history/countries/iraq/">Iraq</a>. Except for diehard American Republicans, a few Brit<br>
Tories and some Middle East folks the WEF was in a foul, angry<br>
anti-American mood. Last year the WEF was a lovefest for America. This<br>
year the mood was so ugly that it reminded me of what it felt like to be<br>
an American overseas in the Reagan years. The rich -- whether they are<br>
French or Chinese or just about anybody -- are livid about the Iraq<br>
crisis primarily because they believe it will sink their financial<br>
fortunes.<br>
<br>
- Plenty are also infuriated because they disagree on policy grounds. I<br>
learned a great deal. It goes FAR beyond the sorts of questions one<br>
hears raised by demonstrators and in UN debates. For example:<br>
<br>
- If Al Qaeda is down to merely 200 terrorists cadres and a<br>
handful of wannabe franchises, what's all the fuss?<br>
<br>
- The Middle East situation has never been worse. All hope for a<br>
settlement between Israel and Palestine seems to have evaporated. The<br>
energy should be focused on placing painful financial pressure on all<br>
sides in that fight, forcing them to the negotiating table. Otherwise,<br>
the ME may well explode. The war in Iraq is at best a distraction from<br>
that core issue, at worst may aggravate it. Jordan's Queen Rania spoke<br>
of the "desperate search for hope".<br>
<br>
- Serious Islamic leaders (e.g. the King of Jordan, the Prime<br>
Minster of Malaysia, the Grand Mufti of Bosnia) believe that the Islamic<br>
world must recapture the glory days of 12-13th C Islam. That means<br>
finding tolerance and building great education institutions and places<br>
of learning. The King was passionate on the subject. It also means<br>
freedom of movement and speech within and among the Islamic nations.<br>
And, most importantly to the WEF, it means flourishing free trade and<br>
support for entrepeneurs with minimal state regulation. (However, there<br>
were also several Middle East respresentatives who argued precisely the<br>
opposite. They believe bringing down <a href="/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam Hussein</a> and then pushing the<br>
Israel/Palestine issue could actually result in a Golden Age for Arab<br>
Islam.)<br>
<br>
- US unilateralism is seen as arrogant, bullyish. If the U.S.<br>
cannot behave in partnership with its allies -- especially the Europeans<br>
-- it risks not only political alliance but BUSINESS, as well. Company<br>
leaders argued that they would rather not have to deal with US<br>
government attitudes about all sorts of multilateral treaties (climate<br>
change, intellectual property, rights of children, etc.) -- it's easier<br>
to just do business in countries whose governments agree with yours. And<br>
it's cheaper, in the long run, because the regulatory envornments match.<br>
War against Iraq is seen as just another example of the unilateralism.<br>
<br>
- For a minority of the participants there was another layer of<br>
AntiAmericanism that focused on moralisms and religion. I often heard<br>
delegates complain that the US "opposes the rights of children", because<br>
we block all treaties and UN efforts that would support sex education<br>
and condom access for children and teens. They spoke of sex education as<br>
a "right". Similarly, there was a decidedly mixed feeling about<br>
Ashcroft, who addressed the conference. I attended a small lunch with<br>
Ashcroft, and observed Ralph Reed and other prominent Christian<br>
fundamentalists working the room and bowing their heads before eating.<br>
The rest of the world's elite finds this American Christian behavior at<br>
least as uncomfortable as it does Moslem or Hindu fundamentalist<br>
behavior. They find it awkward every time a US representative refers to<br>
"faith-based" programs. It's different from how it makes non-Christian<br>
Americans feel -- these folks experience it as downright embarrassing.<br>
<br>
- When Colin Powell gave the speech of his life, trying to win<br>
over the nonAmerican delegates, the sharpest attack on his comments came<br>
not from Amnesty International or some Islamic representative -- it came<br>
from the head of the largest bank in the Netherlands!<br>
<br>
I learned that the only economy about which there is much enthusiasm is<br>

China, which was responsible for 77% of the global GDP growth in 2002.<br>
But the honcho of the Bank of China, Zhu Min, said that fantastic growth<br>
could slow to a crawl if China cannot solve its rural/urban problem.<br>
Currently 400 million Chinese are urbanites, and their average income is<br>
16 times that of the 900 million rural residents. Zhu argued China must<br>
urbanize nearly a billion people in ten years!<br>
<br>
I learned that the US economy is the primary drag on the global economy,<br>
and only a handful of nations have sufficient internal growth to thrive<br>
when the US is stagnating.<br>
<br>
The WEF was overwhelmed by talk of security, with fears of terrorism,<br>
computer and copyright theft, assassination and global instability<br>
dominating almost every discussion.<br>
<br>
I learned from American security and military speakers that, "We need<br>
to attack Iraq not to punish it for what it might have, but<br>
preemptively, as part of a global war. Iraq is just one piece of a<br>
campaign that will last years, taking out states, cleansing the planet."<br>
<br>
The mood was very grim. Almost no parties, little fun. If it hadn't been<br>
for the South Africans -- party animals every one of them -- I'd never<br>
have danced. Thankfully, the South Africans staged a helluva party, with<br>
Jimmy Dludlu's band rocking until 3am and Stellenbosch wines pouring<br>
freely, glass after glass after glass....<br>
<br>
These WEF folks are freaked out. They see very bad economics ahead, war,<br>
and more terrorism. About 10% of the sessions were about terrorism, and<br>
it's heavy stuff. One session costed out what another 9/11-type attack<br>
would do to global markets, predicting a far, far worse impact due to<br>
the "second hit" effect -- a second hit that would prove all the world's<br>
post-9/11 security efforts had failed. Another costed out in detail what<br>
this, or that, war scenario<br>
Would do to spot oil prices. Russian speakers argued that "failed<br>
nations" were spawning terrorists --- code for saying, "we hate<br>
Chechnya". Entire sessions were devoted to arguing which poses the<br>
greater asymmetric threat: nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.<br>
<br>
Finally, who are these guys? I actually enjoyed a lot of my<br>
conversations, and found many of the leaders and rich quite charming and<br>
remarkably candid. Some dressed elegantly, no matter how bitter cold and<br>
snowy it was, but most seemed quite happy in ski clothes or casual<br>
attire. Women wearing pants was perfectly acceptable, and the elite is<br>
sufficiently<br>
Multicultural that even the suit and tie lacks a sense of dominance.<br>
Watching <a href="/library/bio/presidents/bill-clinton/">Bill Clinton</a> address the conference while sitting in the hotel<br>
room of the President of Mozambique -- we were viewing it on closed<br>
circuit TV -- I got juicy blow-by-blow analysis of US foreign policy<br>
from a remarkably candid head of state. A day spent with <a href="/library/bio/business/bill-gates/">Bill Gates</a><br>
turned out to be fascinating and fun. I found the CEO of Heinekin<br>
hilarious, and <a href="/library/bio/business/george-soros/">George Soros</a> proved quite earnest about confronting AIDS.<br>
Vicente Fox -- who I had breakfast with -- proved sexy and smart like a<br>
--- well, a fox. David Stern (Chair of the NBA) ran up and gave me a<br>
hug.<br>
<br>
The world isn't run by a clever cabal. It's run by about 5,000<br>
bickering, sometimes charming, usually arrogant, mostly male people who<br>
are accustomed to living in either phenomenal wealth, or great personal<br>
power. A few have both. Many of them turn out to be remarkably naive --<br>
especially about science and technology. All of them are financially<br>
wise, though their ranks have thinned due to unwise tech-stock<br>
investing. They pay close heed to politics, though most would be happy<br>
if the global political system behaved far more rationally -- better for<br>
the bottom line. They work very hard, attending sessions from dawn to<br>
nearly midnight, but expect the standards of intelligence and analysis<br>
to be the best available in the entire world. They are impatient. They<br>
have a hard time reconciling long term issues (global wearming, <a href="/library/medicine/epidemics/aids/">AIDS</a><br>
pandemic, resource scarcity) with their daily bottomline foci. They are<br>
comfortable working across languages, cultures and gender, though white<br>
caucasian males still outnumber all other categories. They adore hi-tech<br>
gadgets and are glued to their cell phones.<br>
<br>
Welcome to Earth: meet the leaders.<br>
<br>
Ciao,<br>
