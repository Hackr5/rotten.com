<h1>Carlyle Group</h1>

The <i>Carlyle Group</i> is a private equity fund, sort of like a invitation-only mutual fund, formed in a 1987 meeting between David Rubenstein and William Conway Jr. at the Carlyle Hotel in Washington. Its assets are around $12 billion, which is actually quite a lot of money to control if you demand profits on it. Those profits thus far have been about 35% per year, very impressive. Carlyle is the 11th largest defense contractor in the United States, and has numerous ventures everywhere -- for instance, a $50M/yr contract training the <a href="/library/history/countries/saudi-arabia/">Saudi Arabia</a> National Guard.
<p>

What makes Carlyle a bit different than ordinary funds is that certain <i>people of influence</i> use their extra-fund connections to benefit the greater good of the fund. Foremost among these is Frank Carlucci, and if you wondered why an $11 billion <i>Crusader</i> defense system is still alive after being dis-recommended by the Pentagon, you need only look this far.

Conspiracy nutjobs see the Carlyle Group as something evil. It's just about money, that's all.
