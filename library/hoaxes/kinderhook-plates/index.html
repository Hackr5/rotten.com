<h1>Kinderhook Plates</h1>

To the fledging <a href="/library/religion/mormonism/">Mormon</a> community in 1843, it was incredible news: six brass plates had been discovered in a mound in Kinderhook, Illinois. Ancient, marked with strange heiroglyphics, they came to the attention of <a href="/library/bio/religion/joseph-smith/">Joseph Smith</a>, who said they looked remarkably like the lettering of the Book of Mormon and that he thought he might be able to translate them.
<p>

Later, these plates were revealed as forgeries; under sworn affidavit, decades later, the creators confessed to their hoax. Of course, this brought up a problem... how had Smith planned to translate them? Did he know they were a hoax? And most importantly... why were Mormons still following the "translated" scriptures?
<p>

Like every religion, <a href="/library/religion/mormonism/">Mormonism</a> has its detractors and its many supporters (it's America's fastest growing church, but a lot of this can be attributed to <I>retroactive baptism</I>). But one of the core problems with this church is that, from even the most non-cynical perspective, the initial founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith, was surrounded by charlatanism, fraud, and lots and lots of pretty women. As a result, there are a number of stories and events with Smith's hand in them that raise a few eyebrows and close a few eyes.
