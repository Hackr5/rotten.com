      Paul's product is the Homeless Simulation Structure, something he came up 
      with six months ago after noticing something remarkably simple: homeless 
      people appear to do little more than just sit on the ground jingling a tin 
      cup, but <em>still</em> they manage to earn enough to stay alive week after 
      week. How is that even possible in a new millenium, where people need computer 
      skills to stay afloat? One common thread immediately ascertained is that 
      all these folks want <em><strong>help</strong></em> - and they're not afraid 
      to ask for it by name.

              Businessmen, mothers and grandmothers, even tourists stopped dead

            Early the next morning, filled with a newfound sense of

        cash from all the cups, and things are going just great. I could never
