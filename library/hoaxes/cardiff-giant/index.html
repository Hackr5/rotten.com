<h1>The Cardiff Giant</h1>
<IMG SRC="NYCOOposter.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>
Discovered by William C. Newell, a farmer from Cardiff, in Upstate New York, on October 16, 1869. It was claimed this ten and a half foot tall statue was a fossilized man who had been buried for many years, and the giant quickly became a tourist attraction. But nominal investigation by experts declared it a statue, and a recently-created one at that. It eventually came to light that the Cardiff Giant had been created by George Hull, a New York tobacconist who hired a stonemason to carve the statue and treat it to appear aged, then transported it to Cardiff and buried it. 
<P>
Not willing to let something silly like the facts get in the way of a good story, the giant continued to attract crowds and was moved to New York City to put on display. <a href="/library/sideshow/barnum/">P.T. Barnum</a> offered to purchase the giant and was turned down; Barnum then created a copy of the giant and displayed <I>that</I>.
<P>
The giant is now on display at the Farmer's Museum in Cooperstown, NY.</p>
