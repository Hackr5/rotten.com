<h1>Hoaxes</h1>
There are many arguments as to what separates Man from the rest of the animal kingdom; we say, it is the power of some members of the human race to face a group of their brethren, smile, and make an entirely false claim. To proclaim something as truth, when it is so far removed from anything true as to exist in its own space entirely.
<P>
The power of the Hoax is how it captures the imagination of a people, only to twist it into cynicism when it is exposed. That is, if it is ever exposed. Many of the forgeries, scams and hoaxes below are <I>still disputed</I> by scores of people as being hoaxes; voluminous information exists discussing them in intense detail, trying to discern what is real and what is false. Meanwhile, the world looks elsewhere for the next amazing "discovery" that will turn out to be someone's twisted idea of fun.</p>
