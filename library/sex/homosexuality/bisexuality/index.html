<h1>Bisexuality</h1>
<h2>Anything that moves, baby. Anything that moves.</h2>

Thanks to Dr. Alfred Kinsey and the sexologists who followed in his juicy footsteps, we know that very few people are <i>exclusively</i> straight or gay. Just about everyone's sexual orientation lies somewhere between 1 and 5 on the Kinsey Scale. But that's kind of like saying most people are ambidextrous -- just because you can <a href="/library/sex/masturbation/">masturbate</a> with either hand, it doesn't make you ready to have your good arm torn off by a harvester.
<p>

Every straight person has had homosexual dreams, daydreams, and impulses at one time or another. That doesn't make you queer -- it doesn't even make you bi. Until you find yourself actually <i>craving</i> a little suck-and-fuck from somebody with the same sex organs as yours, you're strictly a wannabe.
