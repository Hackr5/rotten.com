<blockquote><font size=-1>
At the wedding, during the vows, he finds himself day-dreaming about sex with men. As his "past [boyfriends, prostitution, drag shows, etc.] careened through my mind ... I heard myself say, 'I John, take you, Anne....'" At the wedding reception, he resists leaving until it's so late "I was out of excuses." Finally getting to the bridal suite, he carries his wife "over the threshold (how light she felt!) and into the room. Lush, wood trim stretched everywhere."

John, I know that you've already answered tons of questions on this, but I have to ask you what you have learned this past year in the aftermath of the well-publicized incident in which you went into a homosexual bar in Washington, DC.
<p>

JP: First, I have to say I began I process of coming out of homosexuality about more than 14 years ago, and for a variety of reasons became one of the more prominent individuals of this movement. I think that was due to fact that my wife had been a lesbian. That was somewhat of an oddity. We both had very sensational stories. So for 9 years we had been married and we had been in the public forefront and we are very vocal and thrilled that God has used us to spread this message. But that has a down side, because it feeds your ego and your flesh and your pride and all the things that are broken within you. When I came to work with Focus on the Family, three years ago, it even increased the visibility even more. People wanted me to speak everywhere. I felt like a doll that someone would wind-up and say come give your testimony, come speak here, come fly here, come fly there. In the mean time I was feeling great about my ministry. Now, this story isn't unlike a lot of Christian leaders who trip and fall into problems. I started squeezing God out of my life. I started saying, "I am pretty wonderful. Everyone seems to think so." I was squeezing God out. So a year ago I wanted to escape. I wanted to escape my life. I wanted to escape everything. My reputation. I wanted off the treadmill and I thought I wanted to go back to a gay bar. Well, of course, because God loves me he is not going to let me go out on a leash too long and I was discovered in there.
