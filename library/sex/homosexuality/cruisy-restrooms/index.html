"The incidence of male toilet contacts has never been tabulated, a fantastic undertaking at the very least. It has only just become known and recognized in medical circles as a definite, separate area of male sexual behavior."
<p>

"Perhaps many marriages have been saved by this less than notorious patronage of a recognized house of prostitution. On the other hand, who knows how many contracts have been damaged by the availability and clandestine sexual hysteria manufactured in these cubicles of strange delight?"
<p>

"Strangely enough, you rarely encounter a less than sizable organ. That comes with the anonymity of the [glory] <a href="/library/sex/homosexuality/gloryholes/">hole</a>. You don't need a beautiful face, a fantastic body, or tons of money. All you are offering is a desirable penis and a co-operative partner. Many participants are downright unattractive and the only time they get to exploit themselves and feel free from ridicule, is in the confessional of a toilet booth."
