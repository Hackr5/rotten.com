<h1>Sexual Ethics in Psychology</h1>

<p><img src="slide_tony_melfi.jpg" width="506" height="376" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The 
  <b>American Psychological Association</b> is a scientific and professional organization 
  which serves to uphold the standards and practices of psychology in the United 
  States. In the late 1930s, the APA established an informal <b>ethics committee</b> 
  consisting of experienced, senior psychologists elected or appointed to positions 
  of governance. These individuals were chosen not only for their superior credentials 
  and well-documented case histories, but also for their strict moral compasses, 
  their internal senses of right and wrong, and their own unique interpretations 
  of what constitutes "fair play". Each serves his or her full term 
  without salary, and none are reimbursed for any expenses incurred during the 
  course of an investigation. Unlike a Catholic church outlet quietly shuffling 
  child molesters from parish to parish, the APA ethics committee is not in the 
  business of hiding or protecting rogue, predatorial psychologists. Justice is 
  dispensed swiftly, and in the public eye.</p>
<p><img src="simmons02.jpg" width="125" height="94" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><img src="katz-smile.jpg" width="201" height="195" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">The 
  APA Ethics Code (latest revision effective June, 2003) stipulates quite clearly 
  that psychologists must not engage in sexual intimacies with their clients or 
  patients. Nor can they have sex with individuals they know to be close relatives, 
  guardians, or "significant others" of clients or patients. Prematurely 
  terminating therapy with a patient in order to circumvent this code of conduct 
  would indeed be considered a breach of ethics. Furthermore, psychologists cannot 
  accept as patients any persons with whom they've had sexual relationships in 
  the past, and they cannot engage in sexual intimacies with former patients for 
  at least <b>two years</b> after therapy has come to an unequivocal close. Psychologists 
  who engage in such activity <i>after</i> two years have elapsed bear the additional 
  burden of demonstrating that there has been <b>no exploitation or abuse,</b> 
  in light of all relevant factors -- and good luck with that. The question often 
  arises whether, after terminating therapy, the two people are "ethically 
  free" to commence a sexual relationship. Ethics committees have pursued 
  cases known informally as the "you're cured; your place or mine" variety.</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><img src="55403_m.gif" width="300" height="137" align="right">CASE 
  1:</b> Dr. Hardon was charged by several women with sexual exploitation. He 
  admitted engaging in sexual relations with these women, but denied that he was 
  exploitative. He claimed that they all needed sexual activity to function effectively, 
  and then attempted to elucidate vague theoretical justifications regarding why 
  he was the appropriate person to provide these services. Despite claims by his 
  clients that he forced his sexual attention on them and that the experiences 
  were traumatic, the doctor continued to deny wrongdoing or poor professional 
  judgment. The only issue on which he would agree was that his form of therapy 
  "did not work on these four women, but it has worked beautifully on scores 
  of others".</font></p>
<p><img src="0401-pg1-binge-01.jpg" width="225" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">When 
  a licensed, board-certified psychologist in the United States behaves inappropriately 
  or demonstrates questionable motives resulting in an official complaint, he 
  or she must navigate an exchange with the ethics committee. The dilemmas faced 
  by this board can be extremely difficult and sensitive -- not only in terms 
  of the registered complaint, but also with respect to clients who are now <i>twice</i> 
  as distressed, twice as fragile, or even more vulnerable than they were before 
  undergoing many years of flawed, faulty psychological care. The word "psychologist" 
  (as defined in the <i>General Guidelines for Providers of Psychological Services</i> 
  published by the APA) can mean only one thing: an individual with a doctoral 
  degree in psychology from an organized, sequential program in a regionally accredited 
  university or professional school. As it turns out, there exists a seemingly 
  infinite number of ways a practicing psychologist can screw it all up for everybody, 
  lose his or her license, and exit the profession in disgrace.</p>
<p>The most obvious violations are similar to those you'd find in the Jamba Juice 
  employee handbook. Performing your duties under the influence of alcohol, for 
  instance -- or sneaking bonghits from behind the couch to the extent that your 
  professional duties cannot be carried out. Those alone are grounds for strict 
  fines, penalties, sanctions -- even loss of one's license. In eleven states, 
  much to the chagrin of disgraced therapist Dr. Haywood Jablowme, Ph.D., practicing 
  under a false or assumed name is strictly prohibited. Three states have even 
  begun clamping down on the <i>advertising techniques</i> used to secure and 
  woo new clients, so if your therapist offers you a punch card good for one (1) 
  tube of Dutch boner cream after ten hours of sit-down chitty chat, it <img src="Psychology.jpg" width="394" height="442" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">could 
  very well be a matter for the ethics committee to look into. Fraud or deception 
  in rendering services, obtaining fees, or accepting rebates for professional 
  referrals are notable conduct violations indeed. "Low-carb lifestyle" 
  psychiatric treatment continues to be wholly fraudulent in all fifty states.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, psychologists have been known to willfully, even maliciously engage 
  in acts they know to be in violation of the ethical standards of their profession. 

  Self-serving motives like the need to get laid are common among those guilty 
  of ethical breach. Some psychologists are not even required to be licensed -- 
  such as psychology professors or research psychologists. These individuals often 
  fall through the cracks, avoiding sexual scrutiny altogether, and are subject 
  only to criminal law or the quality control mechanisms of their workplace.</p>
<p>The express prohibition against sexual intimacies in the 2500-year-old Hippocratic 
  Oath was not duplicated by the APA until only a few years ago. While psychotherapy 
  literature has acknowledged the "transference" of feelings among clients 
  and therapists, erotic contact has gone unmentioned until relatively recent 
  times. Charges of sexual exploitation against psychotherapists are increasing, 
  no doubt due to media publicity and the forceful denouncement of client-therapist 
  sex from within the profession. A 1931 letter from <a href="/library/bio/mad-science/sigmund-freud/">Sigmund Freud</a> to his 
  student reveals issues that were being raised fifty years ago:</p>
<p><img src="dipl.jpg" width="350" height="314" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><i>"You 
  have not made a secret of the fact that you kiss your patients and let them 
  kiss you... now I am assuredly not one of those who from prudishness or from 
  consideration of bourgeoisie convention would condemn little erotic gratifications 
  of this kind, but that does not alter the fact that with us a kiss signifies 
  a certain erotic intimacy. A number of independent thinkers will say to themselves, 
  why stop with a kiss? Certainly one gets further when one adopts <b>pawing</b> 
  as well, which after all doesn't make a baby. And then bolder ones will come 
  along who will go further -- to <b>peeping and showing</b> -- and soon we shall 
  have accepted in the technique of analysis the whole repertoire of <b>petting 
  parties,</b> resulting in the enormous interest in psychoanalysis among both 
  analysts and patients."</i></p>
<p>However, sexilicious ethical problems can sneak up on you, as demonstrated 
  by the following case studies. These dilemmas may be wholly unforeseen, the 
  result of inexperience among young psychologists or merely the ignorance of 
  specific principles. In small towns, for instance, where you're the sole practitioner 
  of psychology and the only therapist for miles around -- how do you treat the 
  patient who works full-time at the video store where you rent five pornographic 
  videotapes each night? A simple non-sexual case might be a good starting point:</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><img src="pion_treatment.jpg" width="513" height="247" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><b>CASE 
  2:</b> Dr. Hugh G. Rection, who had a longstanding and intense dislike for a 
  colleague, complained that the colleague engaged in unprofessional conduct by 
  telling people he had "shit for brains" and had, in all likelihood, 
  a small penis. When the committee asked the colleague about the incident, he 
  countercharged that Dr. Rection had been making horrendous remarks about him 
  for years.</font></p>
<p>In this instance, the committee realized that it could not resolve the ethical 
  issues or the intense interpersonal difficulties between the two doctors, given 
  the limitations of its scope and function. A duplicate letter was sent to both 
  psychologists indicating it was withdrawing from the case, and noting that it 
  was a no-win situation for all concerned. These disputes can be likened to a 
  college student complaining that she got a B when she clearly deserved an A 
  -- the sort of assessment virtually impossible to resolve with committee intervention. 
  Ethical violations of a sexual nature are frequently more vivid:</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><img src="therapy.jpg" width="215" height="195" align="left"><b>CASE 
  3:</b> Leela Loosegoose worked as a receptionist and secretary for Dr. Rod Popper, 
  Ph.D. Dr. Popper approached her about acting as a sexual surrogate for some 
  of his male clients. Loosegoose agreed, and allegedly so enjoyed the surrogate 
  work that she began to offer such services on a freelance basis in addition 
  to her work for Dr. Popper's clients. Subsequently, her spouse filed for divorce 
  and sued for custody of their two children, citing her work was similar to that 
  of a prostitute. Loosegoose sought emotional damages from Dr. Popper, later 
  claiming he seduced her.</font></p>
<p>Indeed, the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists 
  have developed a code of ethics and training guidelines for psychologists practicing 
  in this highly specialized field. Perhaps the most dramatic focus of concern 
  in the practice of "sex therapy" involves the use of sexual surrogates: 
  i.e., sexual partners used by mental health professionals who assist clients 
  in the engagement of a variety of social and sexual activities for a fee. This 
  practice can lead to substantial ethical and legal complications. In some states, 
  a psychologist who refers a client to a sex surrogate may be liable for criminal 
  prosecution under local prostitution statutes -- even charges of rape, if some 
  aspect of the relationship goes wrong, or is brought to the attention of a zealous 
  district attorney. Substantially harmful publicity can initiate deeply troubling 
  shockwaves throughout the psychological industry. Even sexual identity can be 
  called into question:</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b><img src="priss.jpg" width="225" height="280" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">CASE 
  4:</b> Dr. Dick Pincher, Ph.D. agreed to treat Cecil Q. Prissy, age 5, whose 
  parents were concerned about his effeminate behaviors. Dr. Pincher devised a 
  behavioral approach for implementation at the office and at home involving toy 
  choice, dress-up play, and various other activities of a stereotypical sex-role 
  nature. Dresses were worn, make-up and cosmetics applied, feminine wigs donned, 
  and photographs taken for the child and his parents to discuss later.</font></p>
<p>When reports of Pincher's project were published in a professional journal, 
  a storm of protests ensued. The use of coercive persuasion and "deprogramming" 
  are often on par with hypnosis. In general, it is unethical for a psychotherapist 
  to coerce a client into treatment or to force certain goals or outcomes against 
  the client's wishes. Often these ethical dilemmas revolve around the matter 
  of client's involvement in making choices rather than the technique itself -- 
  and where a child's sexual identity comes into play, most areas are regarded 
  as judicial thin ice.</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>CASE 5:</b> Don Splatter, 
  Ph.D. designed an aversive treatment program to deal with severely retarded 
  residents of a state school who were urinating in the hallways. The program 
  involved a deterrent: a quick spray of ice water administered from a small squirt 
  bottle -- right into the face of a patient caught using a corridor as a bathroom. 
  Some of the resident attendants were inadequately trained in the subtler applications 
  of the technique. Ignoring Splatter's instructions, employees instead pulled 
  a perpetrator's pants down and pushed his face repeatedly into a toilet bowl 
  while flushing it several times.</font></p>
<p><img src="splatter.jpg" width="250" height="389" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">In 
  this instance, clearly the attendant did not discriminate between the intended 
  shock value of the ice water spray and the sexually sadistic, punitive act of 
  holding a person's head in the toilet. Unfortunately, not all psychologists 
  who attempt to employ behavioral techniques are well trained in underlying learning 
  theory. Confusion on the distinction between the concepts of <em>punishment</em> 
  and <em>negative reinforcement </em>is only one example of a common problem 
  often resulting in the need for committee review. Psychologists should show 
  careful concern for ethical problems inherent in the use of aversive stimuli, 
  spray bottles, and toilets.</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>CASE 6:</b> Barbara Streisand 
  sought a consultation from Dixon Cox, Ph.D. shortly after her divorce to discuss 
  her inability to control her rage toward her spouse. Cox, recently divorced 
  himself, did not mention his similar situation to Streisand. As Dr. Cox listened 
  to her vindictive attacks against her ex-husband, he found himself tensing considerably 
  and biting his lip until it began to bleed onto his shirt collar. Minutes later, 
  Mrs. Streisand screamed and fled from the office, later writing to an ethics 
  committee that Dr. Cox was a vampire.</font></p>
<p>In cases where the psychologist is found innocent of ethical misconduct, it 
  is the <i>complainant</i> who misunderstood either the psychologist's conduct 
  or the psychologist's responsibilities in certain difficult situations. At other 
  times, while the psychologist's behavior could hardly be described as exemplary, 
  his behavior might not be judged to be outside the realm of tolerable human 
  expression given the context of the situation. Presently there are six disciplinary 
  levels of misconduct as characterized by the APA, ranging from probationary 
  to expulsion:</p>
<p><b><img src="124.gif" width="431" height="350" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">LEVEL 
  1A:</b> <i>Educative Advisory.</i> Not clearly unethical behavior, but in poor 
  taste or insufficiently cautious. These offenses fall into gray areas, often 
  dealing with newly emerging issues or problems.</p>
<p><b>LEVEL 1B:</b> <i>Educative Warning.</i> A "cease and desist" notice 
  from an ethics committee might accompany a finding that a mild or minor infraction 
  had occurred.</p>
<p><b>LEVEL IIA: </b><i>Reprimand.</i> A finding of clearly unethical misconduct, 
  when the psychologist "should have known better," although the consequence 
  of the action or inaction may have been minor.</p>
<p><b>LEVEL IIB: </b><i>Censure.</i> Deliberate or persistent behavior that could 
  lead to substantial harm to the client or public -- although little harm may 
  have occurred.</p>
<p><b>LEVEL IIIA: </b><i>Stipulated or Permitted Resignation.</i> Continuing or 
  dramatic misconduct producing genuine hazard to clients, the public, and the 
  profession; questionable motivation to change or demonstrate concern for the 
  behavior in question.</p>
<p><b>LEVEL IIIB:</b> <i>Expulsion (Voided Membership)</i>. Individual clients 
  or others with whom the psychologist worked are substantially injured with serious 
  questions about the potential rehabilitation of the psychologist in question.</p>
<p>No instance of a male client pressing charges of sexual exploitation against 
  a female therapist has ever been reported by the APA, although two male clients 
  have submitted formal complaints against their male therapists. If an investigation 
  reveals no evidence of wrongdoing, the psychologist and complainant are so informed, 
  and the case is closed. Despite their most vigorous investigatory efforts, ethics 
  committees may not be able to obtain sufficient evidence to render a verdict 
  one way or another. In lieu of credible witnesses or supporting documentation, 
  it all comes down to one person's word against another.</p>
