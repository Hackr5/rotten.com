<h1>Date Rape</h1>

<p>It's not looking good: American standards dictating what passes for beauty
  in a prospective mate have reached their lowest point in decades. In December
  of 2005, the <b>NPD
  Group,</b> a
  marketing and information aggregation service reported that 76% percent of
  surveyed Americans confirmed that being overweight is not only completely acceptable,
  but downright sexy as well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, pale doughy clumps of trashy amateur "models" with droopy
  ice cream cone tits bark themselves hoarse from the pages of pornographic web
  sites. Every available square inch of formerly-fuckable female real estate
  seems overinked with hideous clip art more closely resembling a random smattering
  of haphazardly-affixed Chiquita banana stickers than the agenda of a kick-ass<img src="dr_three.jpg" width="355" height="296" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >  alternative rock star. The only individuals more battered, chapped
  and molestered than today's women are the <b>men.</b> Unable to grow into their
  own wispy moustaches, they live among five or six roommates in cramped, unhygienic
  apartments which serve only to lampoon their fading dreams of one day attending
  Burning Man on the moon. Straight and gay alike! Since when did it become okay
  for homosexualistic twentysomethings to leave their big-ass balls unshaved
  and grow out scruffy, uneven sideburns? Everyone in town is <b>ugly
    and gross,</b> expectations
  for beauty and brains have been completely exhausted by an ever more diverse
    and accepting
    amalgamation of hideous culture, which means there's <i>never
    been a better time</i> in
    American history for the average shitheel schmuckleberry to go out there
    and <b>just
  get laid.</b> </p>
<p>But
  it's important to recognize an unseen portion of this population: those individuals
  among us who <b>cannot</b> -- for whatever
  reason -- establish a situation where relaxed nudity and subsequent intercourse
  occur naturally and without force. The mentally retarded, the handicapped,
  those incapable of delivering easy-breezy pick up lines on cue, people who
  are too shy or inexperienced to meet <img src="dr_nomeans.jpg" width="265" height="291" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >women, and angry shell-shocked Bible Belt
  veterans returning home from the war in <a href="/library/history/war/wmd/saddam/">Iraq</a>, to name just a few. <b>All</b>  these
  people have a right to know exactly what their dating options are, and what
  exactly they've been missing. </p>
<p>If rape is traditionally about power, then <b>date rape</b> is
  all about sex -- the sooner the better please, and not so much with the chitty-chatter.
  Date rape in America raises a number of ethical questions. Since it's technically
  a "date," are
  you still obligated to pay for dinner when the intercourse is guaranteed? It's
  a thorny issue. Historically, women have stopped date rape dead its tracks
  simply by uttering the magical three-letter code word known as <b>"yes".</b></p>
<p>Let's
  go back in time. Two noteworthy instances in our nation's very own <a href="/library/religion/bible/historical-construction/">Holy Bible</a>
  cite perhaps the earliest cultural attitudes toward date rape. In Genesis 39:15, <b>Joseph</b>  (of
  Technicolor Dreamcoat fame) is sent to prison on a false charge of attempted
  rape brought about by Potiphar's
  wife:</p>
<blockquote><i>She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home. Then she told
  him this story: "That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport
  of me. But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and
  ran out of the house."</i></blockquote>
<p> In Genesis 9:20-27, <b>Noah</b> (as in Noah's Ark) gets drunk, passes out, and
  is sexually molested by his son Ham:</p>
<i><img src="dr_piss.jpg" width="270" height="394" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left"><blockquote>Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard. When he drank
  some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent. Ham,
  the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers
  outside. But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders;
  then they walked in backward and covered their father's nakedness. Their faces
were turned the other way so that they would not see their father's nakedness.
  When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done
  to him, he said, "Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to
  his brothers."</i></blockquote>
<p>Date rape's come a long way, baby. In <i>A Natural History of Rape: Biological
    Bases of Sexual Coercion</i> first
    published by MIT in 2000, scientist
  Randy Thornhill and anthropologist Craig T. Palmer elocuted a case for rape
  as a logical extension of human evolution. The impulse to rape remains a fixed
  part of the male mental psyche, strong enough to survive for thousands of years
  despite strong social sanctions and legal penalties. The paper first challenges
  the notion that "rape isn't about sex," by reminding readers that <b>working,
    functional boners</b> must be present for forced sex to occur. They observe
  that rape is a "symptom of an unhealthy society in which men fear and
  disrespect women". Maybe once their editor changes <b>fear</b> to <b>dislike,</b> it'll
  be <i>off to the Pulitzers!</i> </p>
<p><img src="dr_passed.jpg" width="450" height="338" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Thornhill and Palmer based a portion of their rape studies on the<b> scorpion
  fly.</b> Male flies are equipped with a hooked appendage which serves a singular
  purpose: it seizes firmly around the female's forewings to prevent her escape
  during involuntary mating. This sharp raping clamp is Plan B -- a
  backup strategy easily employed in case the female rejects courting bribes
  like smaller dead insects. </p>
<p>These
  days, <b>reverse</b> clamping technology promoting an anti-rape agenda is being
  pioneered in South Africa, where close to 50,000 rapes -- date and otherwise
  -- are reported each year. In 2005, inventor Sonette Ehlers unveiled the <i><b>Rapex</b></i> condom,
  which
  women can conceal snugly in their vaginas (or rear ends) as they might a tampon
  (or butt plug). The device, made of 100% latex, is designed to <b>pierce
  and snap around </b> curious,
  intrusive penises with an battery of sharp, hook-like barbs.</p>
<p>When the device takes hold, the rapist "will obviously be too pre-occupied,"
  Ehlers told a group of reporters near Cape Town. "I promise you he is going
  to be too sore. He will go straight to hospital."</p>
<p><img src="dr_rapex.jpg" width="298" height="397" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >In fact, the  array of spears can only be removed from the penis through <b>immediate
  surgery,</b> effectively alerting hospital staff and police to the rapist's crime. </p>
<p>Critics of the Rapex condom insist the device is medieval and barbaric, and
  only increases the chance of violence against women. If a rape victim is cloaked
  with such a device, and she <i>does</i>  mousetrap-clamp
  a midnight attacker -- he's likely to grow  twice as enraged and deliver an
  extra bonus beating to the woman who wears it. </p>
<p>"This is not about vengeance," the inventor stated in a press conference.
  "The deed, that is what I hate." Yes
  gentlemen, sometimes there <b><i>are</i></b> teeth <a href="/library/sex/vagina-dentata/">down there</a>. </p>
<p>Let's
  not forget that there 
  might be legitimate, real world reasons why you've got no game with the ladies.
  If you're physically handicapped, largely immobile or otherwise unable to overpower
  a female attendant due to a lack of upper body strength, <b>date
  rape drugs</b> might be just your ticket up the flagpole and down a back
  alley. Today, the three most popular date rape drugs are <b>GHB, Rohypnol,
  and Ketamine.</b> </p>
<p><b><i>Fun Fact!</i> GHB,</b> a.k.a. <i>gamma-hydroxybutyrate</i> is a <b>Schedule
    I</b> drug
  under the U.S. Department of Justice Controlled Substances Act. There are
    a total of five Schedules (classifications) of drugs, which means GHB exists
    in the "most aggressively prosecuted" category, best defined by three criteria:
    (1) it has a high potential for abuse, (2) there is no associated medical
    purpose for it to exist, and (3) there are commonly agreed upon health risks.
    <i>Schedule I</i> drugs are therefore not wholly unlike every <a href="/library/culture/vending-machines/">snack food</a>,
    cola beverage and leisure product ever manufactured <b><i><img src="drunk30.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" ></i></b>anywhere in the world
    since the beginning of time. </p>
<p>For
  the most part, GHB serves as a <i>sedative</i> --
  a powerful depressant to a gal's central nervous system. In controlled doses,
  it can even be effective as a general anesthetic. But try telling that to
  federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel in every region of the
  United States, who recognize GHB as the substance most commonly used in drug-facilitated
  sexual assaults. Like freshly squirted ejaculate, GHB <b>tastes kinda salty,</b> so
  it's best served secretively mixed into your victim's strawberry blended margarita.
  There, it can be rapidly absorbed and metabolized into her luscious
  circulatory and nervous systems. Who among us is the most likely to slip GHB
  into your beverage? According to statistics: white frat boys.</p>
<p><b> Rohypnol </b>(flunitrazepam benzodiazepine) is like an Italian mobster
  who encourages you to "forget about it". Manufactured primarily by the
  Hoffman-LaRoche pharmaceutical firm (ostensibly for the short-term treatment
  of sleeping disorders), it really is the Holy Grail of date rape vehicles -- <img src="dr_carpet.jpg" width="400" height="299" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >
  the much sought-after <i>roofie.</i> It's tasteless,
  odorless, and quick to dissolve. Correct doses of the drug can result in more
  unaccounted-for <b>lost
    time</b> than a poking, probing <a href="/library/cryptozoology/aliens/">UFO abduction</a>. Widely available in Europe,
    Mexico and Colombia, roofies can be mixed with a drink,
    snorted, or injected. Hey gals: anyone wanna sign up for a backpacking tour
    of Central America? Seriously, let's all go together, my treat. </p>
<p>The street value of a single roofie (according to the White House) is less
  than five dollars. These days, it's important to combine roofies with juice,
  fruit punch or a multi-colored tropical drink capable of concealing the blue
  dye commonly associated with the drug. It serves as an immediate
  remedy for depression or anxiety, and produces a stimulating high within the
  first fifteen to twenty minutes of ingestion. What follows is a reduction in
  responsiveness, a lack of psychomotor performance and<b> very relaxed muscles.</b> Let's
  lower those swinging arms, ladies. Lower. <i>Lower.</i> Down they go. Unclench
  those fists and be a lover, not a fighter. How ya doin' there. Good girl. </p>
<p><b>Ketamine</b> hydrochloride -- perhaps the most special of  <i>K's</i>  --
  is a Schedule III dissociative psychedelic used by veterinarians as an injective
  intramuscular anesthetic. Ketamine is able to block nerve<b><img src="roofies.jpg" width="216" height="305" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" ></b> paths without restricting
  one's ability to circulate blood or breathe properly. First synthesized by the
  American Parke Davis Lab in 1962 as an alternative to PCP, the patent rights
  to Ketamine are actually held by the country of Belgium. As it spread across
  Europe and throughout
  the world, it quickly gained a reputation as a knock-em-out courtship drug,
  and was made illegal in the United States in August of 1999. Interestingly enough,
  weak doses of Ketamine are still widely available in topical lotions for use
  with chronic pain. </p>
<p>If ordering "roofies" off the Internet strikes you as distasteful
  or complicated, or date rape pills are difficult to come by in your social
  circle, consider instead cheaper over-the-counter alternatives like wine coolers
  or spirited spritzers. <b>Alcohol</b> is
  universally agreed upon by pharmacists and frat boys alike as the number one
date rape tool ever manufactured.</p>
<p>Booze, in all its many forms, performs three basic tasks essential to
  the big score: it decreases a woman's ability to think clearly,
  it reduces her ability to make good judgments, and it drastically limits her
  ability to protect her chastity. Most importantly, in large doses it can cause
  black-outs and memory loss, two key ingredients to a successful date rape.
  Perhaps the Internet poetess known only as <i>~MKP~</i> said it best in her
  impassioned libretto  <b>I Thought Not
    Me:</b></p>
<p><i><img src="dr_kick.jpg" width="301" height="322" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >Rape on a date<br >
  I thought not me<br >
  It just wasn't<br >
  A possibility<br >
  I gave my keys away<br >
For I drank too much that day! </i></p>
<p>Why, she  could have been serenading nineteen year old Nicholas Lumley of
  Brevard County, Florida. He's the enterprising nineteen year old who, in January
  of 2005, managed
  to get a fifteen-year-old so intoxicated she rendered herself unconscious
  several times in a row. Once she was properly drunk and date-rapeable, three
  of his friends watched and videotaped a number of naked, sexual to-dos between
  her and the assailant. And she <b>never
  would have found out,</b> had he not sidled up next to her and said, "You
  know, I had sex with you and I videotaped it." <i><b>D'oh! </b></i>And what's
  the deal with all these date rape allegations coming out of  <i>Florida?</i> I'm
  talking to you, William Kennedy Smith, Norwegian rocker Roger Tiegs, and Marlins
  baseball player Ramon Castro! No wonder
  Miami Beach is such a great place to retire.</p>
<p>Maybe next
  time, Lumley's victims will <b>think twice</b> about setting
  their alcoholic beverages down directly on the counter top <b>without using
  a coaster.</b> Seriously!
  The <i>Drink Safe Sales</i> company, under the guidance of Dr. Brian Glover
  (actually a <a href="/library/crime/drugs/self-dentistry/">dentist</a> who dabbles in chemistry)  has invented the <i>Personal
  Date Rape Drug Testing Kit.</i></p>
<p><i><img src="dr_comic.jpg" width="301" height="295" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" ></i>This portable
  pocketbook laboratory is cleverly disguised as a rectangular cardboard coaster,
  about the size of a credit card. Embedded are space-age chemical test strips
  which react with a visible color change whenever they come into contact with
  an alcoholic drink spiked with date rape drugs. If they turn dark blue, congratulations!
  You're about to be date raped.</p>
<p>And hey now: is date rape something
  you might want <b>your</b> corporation
  inexorably associated with? Using the Drink Safe Sales Quark Xpress printing
  template, you can order custom-made Date Rape Coasters with your own company
  logo and personal message. Minimum order: 10,000 units at fifty cents apiece.</p>
<p>So whether you're
  raping a date for the very first time -- or just <i>on</i> a  date getting
  date raped for the very first time -- try not to <b>ruin it for the rest of
  us</b>  by confessing to your youthful indiscretions. Come on, America: get
  out there and buy that special someone a drink. You'll be glad you did. Surely
  there must be <i>one</i> woman
  at a tavern near you who's so ugly and bored that she's slipping herself
  roofies, but <b>you'll never know</b> if you're too scared to leave your computer.  </p>
