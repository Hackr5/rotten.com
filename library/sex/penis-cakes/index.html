<h1>Penis Cakes </h1>

<p>I'm Bill Kurtis. For centuries, men and women have searched for  innovative
  ways to stuff their mouths with enormous dicks. Whether single or looking,
  straight or gay, happily married or fading quietly into the background
  of an interminable bachelorette party, never forget that <b>Valentine's
  Day</b> looms somewhere in your immediate future.
  This year, instead of disposable diamonds, sappy love poems or a forgettable
  second honeymoon, take a cue from the <i>Rotten Library</i> and lovingly craft
  for your significant other something they can really choke down good and proper. </p>
<p>"Erotic" cakes have an uncertain history, since a cake can
  only be defined abstractly: an amalgam of doughy, tactile ingredients smooshed
  together and solidified to some degree -- <i>without</i> necessarily being
  placed against fire or inside a wood burning stove. In ancient times, cakes
  were rolled or hand-pressed into patties which more closely resembled bread,
  optionally sweetened with raisins, nuts, or honey. Whether or not turn-<b><img src="ec_big.jpg" width="250" height="479" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" ></b>of-the-century
  pattycakes will ever qualify as
  "erotic" is a source of endless rivalry among today's leading anthropologists.
  One point of scholarly agreement is that based on cave paintings and crude
  etchings, boobs and boners sure looked weird back then. </p>
<p>Even the English word "cake" is an unfortunate
  generational deritvative of the Norse word <i>kaka</i>, making a scholarly
  review of penis cakes all the more childish. The ancient Greeks called their
  cakes <i>plakous</i>, meaning <b>flat</b> --
  but the word later evolved to evoke images of the <i>placenta</i>, introducing
  concepts which could not be any <b>less erotic</b> and therefore
  beyond the scope of this tutorial. Soap cakes and <b>urinal cakes</b> certainly
  fit the Oxford English dictionary's limited description. They're typically
  flat, and they have been glimpsed in or around the company of penises -- although
  their level of eroticism remains steadfastly relative to personal preference. </p>
<p><img src="ec_urinal.jpg" width="150" height="246" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >The
  earliest cakely prototypes -- erotic or otherwise -- first
  popped up in 17th century Europe, after technological advancements in ovens
  and tin tray molds caught up to the availability of flour and refined sugar.
  The erotic titty cakes and big-balled popovers we've come to know and love
  emerged over time from flattened cookies and shortbreads. </p>
<p>Eventually, sweeter icings evolved from simple fruit garnishes
  and <i>glazes</i>:
  sticky, boiled compositions of sugar and egg whites. Several
  generations of erotic chefs would live and die before refined
  white flour and baking powder replaced yeast, making cakes ten times more
delicious and paving the way for more edible pastries truly worth knob-gobbling. </p>
<p>"You Design It, We'll Bake It" is the company motto of the world-famous
  <b>Kopps  Bakery, </b>where all the cakes are hand-carved and never made from
  a mold. Kopps has been in business since 1961, and now boasts over 350 stores
  around the globe. Their press release claims they can create "any design
  you can imagine, from a couple making love to a hand-carved male organ or a
  female torso with edible panties and bra". The
  names of individual pastries in their bachelorette catalogue reads like a laundry
  list of rejected <i>Hustler</i> magazine
  copy: <i>Dick Laying on Her Breasts, Ride 'Em Cowgirl on a Big Dick, Male
  Organ in Butt, Long Thin Johnson in Big Black Ass </i> (made to order)
  -- and the enigmatic <i>Busted-Up Dick Cake That Had Cum for the Last Time</i>.
  Take at look at the<b> artful, precision handiwork</b> Kopps  can deliver in
just under an hour: </p>

<p>Christ on the cross, maybe they do need a mold. Somebody get these folks a
  muffin tin. Their online order form is similarly cluttered: just millimeters
  away from the link to order a <i>Big
  Daddy Dick Cum Cake,</i> one can accidentally click the <i>Sesame Street
  Elmo</i>  cake. <b>Watch
  those butterfingers, mom.</b></p>
<p><img src="ec_sqiurt.jpg" width="451" height="338" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >And watch those copyrights: a triple-tiered vanilla angel food cake fashioned
  after your ex-boyfriend's cock sock will be easier to market and
  sell than anything you've constructed with a Mickey
  Mouse mold or Spongecake Squarepan. Respected baking supply companies like <i>Sugarcraft</i>  of
  Hamilton, Ohio specialize in the art of food decoration. They go out of
  their way to distance themselves from clients who sell unauthorized cakes
  made from molds of copyrighted characters like Winnie the Pooh, Barney, Dora
  the Explorer and others. In dessert factories, the mantra is still "don't mess
  with the mouse". Copyright police who show up to harass your small-scale bakery
  are happy to set you up with a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Because of zoning regulations, chef Paul Condra's <i>Erotic Bakery</i> in
  Seattle, Washington is the only full-time penis cake manufacturer in the Pacific
  Northwest. Working with a two-man crew, Conda serves close to 150 customers
  each day. "We're
  very streamlined and efficient. The gummy boobs and gummy penises are very
  popular," Condra told the <i>University of Washington Daily</i>. Since 1986,
  Condra's penis cakes have remained the Erotic Bakery's best-selling items --
  so popular, in fact, that the Erotic Bakery has branched out into a line of
  paper goods: plates and napkins covered with penises, penis-shaped straws and
dry pasta fashioned after big bent boners. </p>
<p><img src="ec_iface.jpg" width="451" height="249" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >Other
  hazards  you
  might encounter as a baker of erotic cakes are nuisances constructed
  by cranky, uptight citizenry. In 2005, a Belgian woman sued the owner of a
  private pastry boutique who dared to peddle erotic marzipan figures for Valentine's
  Day. The woman claimed the cakes depicted <b>sexual positions,</b> and
  argued that they shouldn't be publicly displayed in the baker's shop window.
  The chef, identified by the <i>Het Laatste</i> news service only as <b>Baker
  Van Buggenhout</b>  (say it out loud if you wish) insisted that it was all
  in fun -- and that the figures didn't even show sexual organs.</p>
<p>"People laugh when they see them," the baker stated calmly, neither bugged
  out nor on the verge of bugging out. "They buy them to give to their wives
  or girlfriends." The elderly complainant who lived near the bakery shop window
  insisted that by putting the erotic morsels on display, the baker was effectively
  exposing children to pornography.</p>
<p><img src="ec_men.jpg" width="360" height="172" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Meanwhile,
  have 
  you seen what passes for window displays in Amsterdam? Hint: big floppy
  half-naked <b>prostitutes</b> underneath
  red light bulbs, none of which are made of fresh marzipan. And
  as for you footloose and fancy-free gay dads, Kopps Bakery
  more or less has you covered with treats like the <i>Gay
  Bed Cake</i> and
  the infamous <i>Marzipan Men To Lick Cake</i>. This treat features two cuddly
  Ken doll look-a-likes, determined dongs pointing north, cavorting in the
  yin-yang position. In
  addition to misshapen lumps of frosting, Kopps' Erotic Bakery created the world's
  largest chocolate cream pie for the <i>Rosie O'Donnell</i> show:
  over six feet in diameter and 800 pounds. Then in 1998, they created the world's
  largest Pop Tart, showcased in Madison Square Garden -- 25 feet by 35 feet,
  weight over 1500 pounds. </p>
<p><img src="ec_pan2.jpg" width="224" height="360" vspace="5" align="left" >If
  your modeling skills are less than stellar -- or the idea of squeezing dough
  into crude shapes which only vaguely resemble testicles, <b>penis cake
  pans</b> might
  be the way to go. Suitable for shaping cookies, brownies, or Jell-O,
  the majority of consumer peckerware and booby molding cups are dishwasher safe
  and non-tarnishing. Naturally, they're available in a variety of "big
  boy"
  shapes, sizes and circumcisions -- and quite perfect for raucous bachelorette
  parties or nudging that long-awaited sexual harassment suit up into second
  gear. For those even less talented in the cooking department, curiously-shaped <b>cake
  toppers</b> are
  an elegant afterthought. These are miniature, edible accoutrements, typically
  made of marzipan or a gelatinous gummy bear substance, widely available in
  novelty shops. Cake toppers can be  squiggled and bent to represent numerical
  shapes <i>(Congrats On Your 40th)</i> or fashioned from fine beeswax into proper
  candles, affectionately referred to as <b>dicks with wicks.</b> </p>
<p>The <b>inscriptions</b> which traditionally accompany personalized erotic
  cakes -- penis and otherwise -- range from lukewarm and uninspired to dull-as-an-office-party.
  According to <i>Masturbakers,</i> a
  custom cake and pastry manufacturer in New York, there are eight particularly
  popular pieces of copy which never go out of style. In no particular order,
  consider communicating your appreciation with clever quippery like <i>Tits
  Your Birthday, Breast <img src="ec_gak.jpg" width="240" height="180" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Wishes, Make A Wish And Blow, This Butt's For You, To
  Have And To Hold, The Breast Is Yet To Cum,</i> and of course the old chestnuts <i>A
  Hard Man Is Good To Find</i> and <i>Have
Your Cake And Eat It Too</i>.</p>
<p>Masturbakers'
  cakes are reasonably priced: an extra large <b>John Holmes</b> cake will run
  you about $100. A large <b>Pussy</b> cake,
  meanwhile, goes for $65. The <b>Tommy Lee, </b>with optional tuxedo, will feed
  anywhere from ten to twelve children for a modest $45. All the way across
  the country -- for <b>$1,800</b> -- costume
  and prop supplier<i> Tim
    Vittetoe Originals </i>in
  Washington state can
  manufacture a pop-out <b><i>stripper cake</i></b> four feet in diameter, perfect
  for stage shows or special events, and capable of supporting 
overweight strippers weighing up to and including <i>three hundred pounds!</i> Gross. </p>
<p><img src="ec_tits.jpg" width="269" height="133" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >When
  Adam Roberts of <i>Amateur Gourmet</i> chose to immortalize floppy, disgusting
  boobs in dessert form, he took a cue from the Janet Jackson Super Bowl incident.
  Roberts found the perfect recipe for cappuccino cupcakes with cocoa-tinted
  white chocolate and sour cream frosting. The <b>hard</b> part was making the
  boobs just the right shade of brown, to match Ms. Jackson's skin tone. After
  several experiments, he ended up sifting together powdered sugar with "a cautious
  amount" of cocoa. A single Hershey's Kiss served as the nipple, piping white
  icing in a spider web lattice to simulate the nipple jewelry. "The likeness
  was uncanny," Roberts reported. So delighted was Adam with his erotic accomplishment
  that he now sells T-shirts celebrating his Jackson cupcakes. </p>
<p><img src="ec_stewart.jpg" width="240" height="181" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >And
  let's never forget the dutiful service record of  <b>Patrick
    Stewart</b> (a.k.a. Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the <a href="/library/culture/star-trek/">Starship Enterprise</a>) who
    served as a guest host on <i><a href="/library/culture/snl/">Saturday Night Live</a></i> in February of 1993.
    One of the characters he chose to portray was a baker of erotic cakes, fixated
    on one subject in particular. Let's ripple-dissolve
    to the fading sound of angels strumming on flashback harps and remember that
    classic sketch together. </p>
<p><b>Young Man</b>: Yeah, my friend's having a bachelor party, and I thought
  it might be kind of fun if I got him an erotic cake. <br >
    <br >
    <b>Picard</b>: Well, you've come to the right place. I have the perfect sexy
    cake for a bachelor party. <i>[opens box]</i> <br >
    <br >
    <b>Young Man</b>: Looks like a woman going to the bathroom. <br >
    <br >
    <b>Picard</b>: Yeah! It's very sexy. <br >
    <br >
    <b>Young Man</b>: What else do you have? <br >
    <img src="ec_sorry.jpg" width="402" height="318" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" ><br >
    <b>Picard</b>: Well, why don't we take a look at our catalogue? Here's a
    woman squatting behind some bushes. The leaves are made of spun sugar. And
    here's a lady using a little marzipan port-o-potty. <br >
  <br >
  <b>Young Man</b>: So, all your cakes are women going to the bathroom? <br >
  <br >
  <b>Picard</b>: Yeah. What's your point? <br >
  <br >
  <b>Young Man</b>: Well, don't you have anything else? <br >
  <br >
  <b>Picard</b>: Maybe you don't understand - this is an <i>erotic bakery.</i><br >
  <br >
  <b>Young Man</b>: I'm sorry, I just don't find this very erotic. <br >
  <br >
  <b>Picard</b>: A woman going to the bathroom, you don't find it erotic? <br >
  <br >
  <b>Young Man</b>: Not really. <br >
  <br >
  <b>Picard</b>: Well then, <i>what</i> pray tell would you suggest we do put
  on our erotic cakes? <br >
  <br >
  <b>Young Man</b>: I don't know. People having sex. Female and male genitalia.
  You know, something like that. <br >
  <br >
  <b><img src="ec_shitbag.jpg" width="451" height="284" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Picard</b>:
  Well, if <i>that's</i> what you're after, I suggest you try Hostess or Sara
  Lee! <br >
  <br >
  <b>Young Man</b>: Can't you just make a cake with a couple on it having sex? <br >
  <br >
  <b>Picard</b>: All right, look. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll make a cake
  with a woman <i>and</i> a man going to the bathroom. And that way <i>you'll</i> be
  happy and your friends will be happy. <br >
  <br >
  <b>Young Man</b>: I don't think my friends would like that either. <br >
  <br >
  <b>Picard</b>: Well, I would certainly like to meet these friends of yours
  sometime. <br >
  <br >
  <b>Young Man</b>: Look, could we just have a cake with sex and no going to
  the bathroom? <br >
  <br >
  <b>Picard</b>: May I remind you that you're going to have to <i>eat</i> this
  cake? </p>
<p>Today of course,
  dirty pictures from your computer -- even in GIF or JPEG format -- can easily
  be transferred photo realistically to a cake right in your own home, without
  the hassle of nosy third-party erotic vendors or copyright enforcement police.
  Feel free to <b>do
  it yourself:</b> the <i>CopyKake</i>  company in
  Torrence, California sells edible inks offering outstanding color reproduction
  with a <b><img src="ec_showers.jpg" width="417" height="309" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" ></b>minimum
  of "head clogging," a  common printing problem which sounds
conspicuously like the inspiration for an erotic cake in and of itself.</p>
<p> Intentional
  or otherwise, CopyKake's groundbreaking line of computerized cake decorating
  products have helped bring erotic pastries into the twenty-first century. Sadly,
  the majority of customers who purchase edible inks have yet to adequately exploit
  the technology for the purposes of erotica. </p>
<p>Printers compatible with the <i>Canon</i> brand of bubble jets can be loaded
  with edible ink cartridges -- cyan, magenta, yellow and black. The unused inks
  have a shelf life of six months, if properly refrigerated. Thermal reversibility
  allows for an optimum ratio of colored inks to bond with the icing. Pornography
  can be printed with these edible inks onto  <b>frosting sheets:</b>  light,
  edible papers made of corn starch and sugar. The sheets, freshly inked, are
  peeled from their backings and laid atop a refrigerated cake flat-frosted with
  butter cream or non-dairy topping. In fifteen minutes, your hand-made erotic
  cake will be more than ready to sproing on a loved one -- just in time for
  Valentine's Day.</p>
