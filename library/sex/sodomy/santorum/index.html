<h1>Santorum</h1>

<blockquote><B>san-TOR-um</b> <i>n.</i> A frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the by-product of <a href="/library/sex/anal-sex/">anal sex</a>.  <I>See also: Sen. Rick Santorum (R - PA).</i></blockquote>
<P>

In April 2003, Republican senator <b>Rick Santorum</b> made some asinine comments in defense of laws banning gay sex. While this in itself may seem unremarkable, many people were amazed at how much <b>detail</b> he went into. Rick wasn't satisfied to call it 'degenerate' and move on. He really, <i>really</i> wanted to talk about sex, so he told the Associated Press: <I>"If the Supreme Court says that you have a right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to <a href="/library/religion/mormonism/">polygamy</a>, you have the right to <a href="/library/sex/incest/">incest</a>, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything."</i> Well, little did he know that two months later the <a href="/library/sex/sodomy/supreme-court/">Supreme Court</a> would rule anti-sodomy laws unconstitutional... <i>whoops!</i>
<P>

It's not every day that a U.S. Senator squirts out a nugget like that. Public outcry was considerable, yet readers of Dan Savage's syndicated sex column <I>Savage Love</i> feared the ensuing scandal would soon be flushed away and forgotten. Acting on the suggestion of a reader, Savage issued this challenge:
<P>

<blockquote>
There's no better way to memorialize the Santorum scandal than by attaching his name to a sex act that would make his big, white teeth fall out of his big, empty head. And don't doubt for a moment that Savage Love readers have that power. Savage Love readers selected "pegging" for a woman doing a man in the ass with a strap-on dildo—much to my Aunt Peggy's dismay—and "pegging" is already showing up in dictionaries of sexual slang. So, readers: Should a "Santorum" be a common or a rare sex act? Vanilla or kinky? Sweet or gruesome?
</blockquote>
<P>

Submissions were published in a later column, readers voted, and the lube-fecal matter concoction entry won by a <i>landslide</i>:
<P>

<blockquote>
While I agree with the spirit of naming something objectionable (to him) after Rick Santorum, I think it should be a substance, not an act. I would never want to Santorum anyone I liked. What a turnoff. Instead, I think it would be better to name some kind of sexual byproduct after him. After all, ending up with idiots like Santorum in elected office is a byproduct of the otherwise desirable practice of letting any old yokel vote. Specifically, I nominate the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex. As in, "We had a great time, but we got Santorum all over the sheets." Or better yet, "Before I sodomize my gay, unmarried dog, I like to give him an enema so there won't be any Santorum."
<p>
<i>—Wipe Up That Santorum, Anal Pokers</i>
</blockquote>
<P>

Since then, efforts to promote use of the word have had considerable success.
