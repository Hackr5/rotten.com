<h1>Teabagging</h1>

<p><a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/nancy-reagan/">Nancy Reagan</a> may have drawn comparisons between women and tea bags, but it was veteran director John Waters who reintroduced the concept of <i>teabagging</i> to worldwide audiences in the film <i>Pecker</i>.</p>

<p>Essentially, teabagging involves a male stripper who looms over you, and repeatedly taps or otherwise smooshes his balls against your face and forehead.</p>

<p>Other definitions of the word have come to include the act of sucking on a used tampon, lowering one's scrotum into another person's mouth, and a variation of oral sex wherein the receiver reclines with his head tilted back over the edge of a bed. A penis is inserted into his mouth, and testicles bounce across his forehead with each thrust. Outside the sexual world, <i>teabagging</i> is terminology used by wind surfers and parasailers: you are "teabagged" when you get dunked underneath choppy waters against your will.</p>

<p>On October 25, 2002, two students at a Pittsburgh Catholic high school were arrested for indecent assault, unlawful restraint, involuntary servitude and conspiracy after allegations arose that they forcibly teabagged a fellow student after football practice. The suspects, aged 15 and 16, were accused of restraining a 15-year-old victim, and slapping him in the face with their genitals.</p>

<p>The victim's father stated that when he went to pick up his son from practice the day of the incident, he found his son's head had been shaved. The victim then told his father he had been "tea bagged," and described what occurred.</p>

<p>"It made me sick," the father said. "Kids putting penises on other kids' heads? What does that do for a child's manhood?" </p>

<p>John Waters has openly admitted that teabagging is by and large a ludicrous  sexual act.</p>
