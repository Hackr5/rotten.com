<h1>Plastic Shredders</h1>
<p>Critics of <a href="/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam Hussein</a>'s regime have produced new evidence of his brutality. Ann 
  Clwyd is a member of British parliament and head of the <i>Indict</i> organization 
  which gathers information about war crimes. She cites an Iraqi woman's description 
  of Saddam's use of <b>plastic shredders.</b> The full text of her lurid claim 
  was eagerly shared among journalists and weblog operators for several days during 
  the start of <i>Operation Iraqi Freedom</i>, and then - for whatever reason 
  - summarily abandoned.</p>
<p><code>
<img src="/library/death/execution/plastic-shredder/msw_0005_p62_btm.jpg" height="273" width="270" hspace="10" vspace="10" align=left> "There  was a machine designed for shredding plastic," she told the group. "Men 
  were dropped into it, and we were made to watch. Sometimes they went in head 
  first and died quickly. Sometimes they went in feet first and died screaming. 
  It was horrible. I saw thirty people die like this. Their remains would be placed 
  in plastic bags and we were told they would be used as fish food. On one occasion, 
  I saw Quesay (a son of Saddam) personally supervise these murders."</code></p>
<p>This "shredding" of human beings deserves closer attention. What 
  exactly is a <i>plastic shredder,</i> and how does it work?</p>
<p>Plastic recycling is actually a very big business. Companies like <i>Shred-Tech, 
  Accu-Grind, </i><i>Destroyit</i>, and the <i>Cutter Corporation </i>specialize 
  in what industry professionals romantically refer to as <i>reduction-pulverizing 
  engineering.</i> </p>
<p>

<img src="/library/death/execution/plastic-shredder/STSnew.jpg" height="288" width="270" hspace="10" vspace="10" align=right> A 
  typical shredder consists of a large entry bin, called the <i>hopper.</i> Directly 
  below the hopper lays a vast array of rotating shredding knives (nicknamed <i>grizzlies</i>), 
  streamlined for increased torque and optimized for granulation. These are not 
  desktop paper shredders intended for the disposal of your resumé. </p>
<p>Shredding technology has made substantial advancements since the early 1990s. 
  Shredders of enormous size and horsepower are readily available worldwide. <b>Shredder 
  shaft speeds</b> and <b>knife tip forces</b> are power words used by insiders 
  to determine what a given piece of machinery is capable of. </p>
<p>Aluminum, electronic scraps, automotive materials, textiles, Iraqis - you name 
  it and someone wants to get rid of it. Shredding machines exist for two principal 
  reasons: <i>volume reduction</i> and <i>complete destruction</i>. If your shredder 
  is large enough, your regime alone might be able to recycle sixty million pounds 
  of material per year. In order to get the right machine for a specific operation 
  (humane or otherwise), both the user and the supplier need a clear understanding 
  of the intended application.</p>
<p>Because shredders are used for so many different products, it's essential that 
  the operator first consider his current and future processing goals. When buying 
  a shredder, first ask if it will be fed with a conveyor belt or a dumper, and 
  what types of materials are to be recycled. Both parties need to know the size, 
  shape, material properties, and form of the items to be processed.</p>
<p>

<img src="/library/death/execution/plastic-shredder/Fig_370_1-3.jpg" height="158" width="226" hspace="10" vspace="10" align=left> The 
  entire operation of a plastic-shredding recycling center is controlled and monitored, 
  particularly at the crucial points: trailer dump areas, conveyor flow, sorting 
  areas, the baler's compacting chamber, and bale loading stations. By means of 
  closed-circuit television located in a control room (overlooking the trailer 
  dumpers and above the initial sorting area where the trailer loads are dumped) 
  the control-room operator can oversee all the dumping with a full view of the 
  sorting area on multiple screens. It's unknown at the time of this reporting 
  if Saddam regularly complies with hardhat and eye-protection safety guidelines.</p>
