        ethnicity caused heightened sense of alienation. "I wasn't a true 
        spic, a true Jew, true anything. I was miserable fat schmuck with glasses 
        and asthma." Verdict of suicide altered to reflect an "accidental 
        shooting due to influence of Quaaludes," despite suicide note.</p>

        the floor, until he observed a patch of blood by the figure's ear. When 
        police broke down the door, they found Cobain dead: the shotgun still 
        pointed at his chin, and a suicide note written in red ink resting on 
        a nearby counter.</p></td>

        <br>
        Credited with the creation of a literary sub-genre known as "Sword 
        and Sorcery." Became a writer so he could be his own boss. With respect 
        to his aversion to traditional employment, he once remarked, "my 
        passion for freedom is almost an obsession. Writing has always been a 
        means to an end I hoped to achieve. Personal liberty may be a phantom, 
        but I hardly think anybody would deny that there is more freedom in writing 
        than there is in slaving in an iron foundry, or working - as I have worked 
        - from 12 to 14 hours, seven days a week, behind a soda fountain. I have 
        worked as much as 18 hours a day at my typewriter, but it was work of 
        my own choosing." A life-long sufferer of bipolar disorder, Howard 
        grew increasingly morose in the late 1920's. He told his friends only 
        the prospect of his mother's grief kept him from committing suicide. When 
        she finally died, he climbed into his 1935 Chevy and took his life with 
        a borrowed pistol. </p></td>

      Lead singer for punk group The Plasmatics. Regularly arrested for obscenity, 
      resisting arrest and battery. Clashed with police in several cities over 
      the content of her performances. Arresting officers in Milwaukee observed 
      Williams "fondling her breasts, buttocks and vaginal area with her 
      hand." She also feigned sexual intercourse with a sledgehammer handle. 
      She alleged that she had been repeatedly punched and kicked in the face 


      by officers, and used her booking photo (which indicates facial bruising 
      and a black eye) as evidence of the assault. A civil jury rejected her brutality 
      claims in 1984. Williams committed suicide in 1998, at age 48.</td>
