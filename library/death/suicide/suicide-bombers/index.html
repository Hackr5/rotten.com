<td valign=top><font size=-1>White House press spokesman Ari Fleischer unveils President <a href="/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a>'s latest neologism: <i>homicide bombing</i>. When asked to justify the change in terminology, Fleischer responds: "The reason I started to use that term is because it's a more accurate description. These are not suicide bombings. These are not people who just kill themselves. These are people who deliberately go to murder others, with no regard to the values of their own life. These are murderers. The President has said that in the Rose Garden. And I think that is just a more accurate description of what these people are doing. It's not suicide, it's murder."</font></td></tr>
