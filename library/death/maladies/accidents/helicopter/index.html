<td nowrap align=right valign=top><tt>19 May 1993</tt></td>
<td valign=top><font size=-1>Four servicemen are killed on an inspection flight when their Blackhawk helicopter crashes in the woods near Quantico, Virginia. Maj. William Barcley, SSgt. Brian Haney, Capt. Scott Reynolds, and Marine Sgt. Timothy Sabel had flown President <a href="/library/bio/presidents/bill-clinton/">Bill Clinton</a> to the USS <i>Theodore Roosevelt</i> during his visit to the aircraft carrier two months prior. Hence, the men qualify as former "Clinton bodyguards" and their untimely deaths should be interpreted as evidence that they were killed simply because they knew too much.</font></td></tr>
