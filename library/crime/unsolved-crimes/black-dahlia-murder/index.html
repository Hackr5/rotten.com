<h1>Elizabeth Short: "The Black Dahlia"</h1>
A 22-year-old actress-in-waiting (i.e. unsigned) found nude, <a href="/library/sex/sodomy/">sodomized</a>, and horribly disfigured in a field near Hollywood on January 15, 1947. Before her death, she had jet-black hair and a penchant for beautiful black dresses, and this led to her nickname "The Black Dahlia", which was trumped up by newspaper reporters at the time. 
<p>

She has been linked romantically to <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/marilyn-monroe/">Marilyn Monroe</a>, but that sort of thing tends to happen after the fact; other sinister and conspiratorial reasons have also come to light, more likely to sell a story than anything else.
<p>

The murder was never solved, and a number of books have appeared to try and explain who did it. This isn't to say the murder is lacking for leads; many men and women have confessed to Short's murder but all have been found to be lying for whatever reason people do such things.
