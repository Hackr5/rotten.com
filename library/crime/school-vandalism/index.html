<h1>School Vandalism</h1>
<p>Young people! Gotta love 'em. Stuck in classrooms all day long with no money,
  no job, no car, no cell phone, no cool clothes, no fancy shoes, no life experience,
  no art skills, no future prospects -- and no particularly clever virals to
  blog, vlog, slog, upload to YouTube or post on Flickr. As a generation, about
  the only thing they <i><b>do</b></i> have going for them is a big ol' baseball
  bat and this here box of strike-anywhere matches. Is it any wonder then that <i>school
  vandalism</i> is on the rise? It's a meme to the extreme! Won't you catch
  our spirit? </p>
<p><b>School vandalism,</b> for the purposes of this discussion, is willful,
  malicious damage to property or school grounds which is so extensive in scope
  that parents and teachers rally together and the police are called in to investigate. <img src="sv_class1.jpg" width="407" height="325" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left">Proper
  vandalism to a single classroom, gymnasium, or computer lab has rippling effects
  throughout an entire community -- from needy insurance claims to accusations
  of district mismanagement. There is also high drama: a teenage vandal who enthusiastically
  tells his friends how he burned down the high school must steadfastly endure
  Shakespearean levels of inner turmoil as the cops start examining security
  camera footage or preparing <a href="/library/medicine/dna/">DNA</a> swabs for the entire student body. Drawing
  pink hearts on the inside of your locker with a glitter pen does not constitute
  school vandalism.</p>
<p>The schoolhouse, in and of itself, is a prime target for vandalism -- way
  more so than a church, random office building or shopping mall. Schools are
  not only symbols of <i>The Man's</i> mandatory social order and middle-class
  values, they have the highest concentration of potential offenders in high-risk
  age groups who believe that <b>public property belongs to nobody in particular. </b></p>
<p><img src="vandals6.jpg" width="345" height="246" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" >The
  United States has roughly 84,000 public schools, a third of which report
  one or more incidents of vandalism each year, for a grand total of <b>99,000</b> individual
  attacks.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, damage to schools was estimated at $200 million, but by 1990
  that number had climbed to $600 million. The <i>actual</i> number in 2006 is
  impossible to determine, since some school districts only classify "vandalism" as
  something which necessitates an insurance claim. In other districts, administrators
  are wary of reporting <i>every</i> case to the police out of fear that malicious
  crimes which instantly appear on local news services reflect poorly upon their
  management skills. For this reason, <b>very few school vandals are ever apprehended,
  and even fewer are prosecuted. </b></p>
<p>Vandalism on campus is the inevitable aftermath of a procedural term
  police call the <b>school break-in,</b> an act which can only take place when
  the facilities are closed: at night, on weekends, or holidays. <b><img src="sv_ncbuscrash1.jpg" width="400" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" ></b>Schools
  provide an eerie, frozen environment after hours, perfect for break-ins and
  glass smashery -- as do <b>lonely bus yards.</b> In January of 2006, the reward
  for information in a Dubuque, Iowa vandalism case grew to $3200, after <i>KWWL
  News</i> reported that over thirty school buses had their <b>brake lines cut.</b> Such
  brazen disregard for precious human cargo allows these particular crimes to
  ascend from felony criminal mischief to attempted murder. </p>
<p>Incentive programs and reward systems which serve to "find out" who's
  responsible for schoolyard crimes have grown to $750 in Redmond, Washington,
  where schools regularly report windows broken with rocks or other projectiles,
  damaged doors, overturned tables and file cabinets, smashed trophy cases, and
  horrifically discharged fire extinguishers. Soda machines are
  popular targets of kick-overs in Maypearl, Texas. So is the <b>music
  room,</b> where
  in January of 2006 vandals  punched holes in a set of drums, bent a
  saxophone into an un-tootable shape, smashed a guitar over a radiator, snapped
  several flutes and clarinets clean in half, and snipped all eighty-eight strings
  in a grand piano -- to the tune of $40,000 in damages. Thankfully, the school
  marching band now sounds more like Negativland. </p>
<p>The motivating factors behind school-related crimes have an official language
  and three distinct flavors, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p><span class="style1"><b><i><img src="sv_art.jpg" width="470" height="353" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" >Nuisance
      break-ins.</i></b><i> In which a youth breaks into a school, seemingly
      as an end to itself. Little serious damage, mostly exploratory as if to
      say, "Hey look, we got on the roof." Usually nothing of value is taken.</i></span></p>
<p><i><b>Professional break-ins.</b> In which offenders use a high level of force
    or skill to enter the school, break into storage rooms containing expensive
    equipment and remove bulky items from the scene for the purposes of selling
    or exchanging for drugs.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Malicious
  break-ins.</b> In
  which significant, lasting damage to the school's interior or infrastructure
  is sustained.</i></p>
<p><b>What kind of school vandal are you?</b> Statistically you're young and
  male, and still in junior high. The impulse to commit traditional break-ins
  will grow less frequent as you enter high school, where the bullshit really
  begins and you're ready to graduate toward more fulfilling personal quests
  like arson and grand theft. As a vandal, your pathology would very likely include
  poor performance in class. Sometimes you're truant, and you probably have a
  few busts on your record which resulted in suspension, expulsion, or cigarette
  smoking awareness workshops.</p>

<img src="sv_j1.jpg" width="740" height="200">

<p>Yes indeed, you're a <b>misunderstood night-time crusader in a bat cape, </b>fighting
  against the hypocritical injustices of an evil adult world beyond your control.
  You might even have an inadequate understanding or appreciation of the impact
  your destructive impulses has upon others. You're really only concerned about
  real-world, right-now consequences to yourself.</p>

<img src="sv_j2.jpg" width="740" height="200">

<p>Behaviorally speaking, you're no more likely to be emotionally disturbed than
  your neighborhood peers or  long-distance IRC pals. Nor are you more openly
  critical of your instructors' teaching methods. You
  just like stuffing entire rolls of paper towels down the boys' toilet as soon
  as the sun goes down. Or cracking open a rooftop skylight early Saturday morning
  and firing hundreds of neon paint balls into the freshly-carpeted multipurpose
  facility. There's no "deep
  void"
  in your soul which can only be filled by stealing an Intel-based MacBook Pro
  from the computer lab -- you <b>just need a Core Duo </b>if you're ever
  going to be taken seriously as a podcaster. Juvenile lawyers call that kind
  of rational thinking <i>acquisitive</i> vandalism,
  one of several clinically-defined classes of school-related crime.</p>
<img src="sv_col.jpg" width="720" height="125">

<p><i>Ideological</i> vandalism, on the other hand, is oriented toward a social
  or political cause, such as a protest when <a href="/library/culture/cola-wars/">Cokes</a> are no longer available from
  school vending machines. There is <i>vindictive</i> vandalism, such as setting
  fire to your principal's office in revenge after he made you sit on a bench
  during lunch -- and there's <i>malicious</i> vandalism, so named because of
  its viciousness and senseless nature. Malicious school vandalism is the most
difficult for a community to understand.</p>
<p><i><img src="sv_jenks.jpg" width="451" height="338" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" ></i>A
  more creative and visible form of vandalism is <i> hilarious
  vandalism,</i> such as rearranging the plastic snap-on letters on a school
  billboard to deliver alternate or misleading communication
  at the student body. Such cultural jamming can last for several hours without
  anyone in authority really noticing -- or longer, if your discreet wordsmithery
  is applied on or before a three-day weekend. </p>
<p><i>Tactical</i> vandalism is the opposite extreme. It seeks to accomplish
  goals such as getting a school cancelled or shut down completely. In Jacksonville,
  Florida, students at First Coast High were forced to attend classes on the
  lawn after vandals <b>superglued shut </b> one hundred and twenty of the school's
  doors. The prank was discovered by a custodian around 6:00am.
  "They not only did all the classroom doors, of which there are at least
  85,"
  reported one official to <i>First Coast News</i>, "but they did every
  door inside the building." Each sealed lock needed to be replaced, for
  a total cost of several thousand dollars.</p>
<p><img src="sv_kee.jpg" width="451" height="338" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Vandals
  at Eminence High School in Indianapolis, Indiana were not as successful, even
  though their work was twice as complicated. According to <i>WRTV6 News,</i> teen
  pranksters packed tons of smashed eggs, <a href="/library/culture/dog-shit/">Dog Shit</a>, cow shit, and <b>dead animals
  like rabbits and squirrels </b>up against the school's windows. The vandalism
  delayed the opening of the school for one hour, and forced the cancellation
  of a senior field trip to the zoo. Student body president Kyle Malott courageously
  spoke out against the perpetrators, calling their actions "disgusting" and
  describing how sickened he felt to see all the teachers cleaning it up. Police
  later identified Kyle as their main suspect, bringing down nine
  additional seniors and two underclassmen.</p>
<p>Traditionally, school vandalism is a hobby  <b>anyone can perform</b> without
  risking the immediate condemnation of other students. You can even be a grown-up!
  Adult vandals are far more interested in securing high-value items for personal
  use or resale on <i>eBay</i> than scratching crude pictures of <a href="/library/sex/semen/">horse dicks</a>
  on the chalkboard.</p>
<p><img src="sv_episcopal.jpg" width="435" height="314" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" >As
  schools grow more equipped to accommodate hookups to the netterweb, equipment
  such as high-definition digital cameras, VCRs, DVD players, and studio recording
  gear are the latest and greatest targets for theft or defacement. Meanwhile,
  advancements in motion sensors, intruder alarms, heat detection systems, electronic
  barriers, deadbolt locking mechanisms and surveillance video cameras continue
  to evolve along similar timelines. </p>
<p><b>So what kind of vandalism is right for you? </b>It's not a rhetorical
  question. In 1978, Peter D. Vestermark and Seymore D. Blauvelt, Jr. published
  <i>Controlling Crime in the School: A Complete Security Handbook
  for Administrators</i>. This popular reference illustrates a two-dimensional
  array which factors the perceived social costs of school vandalism against
  age-old financial data. The product is a potpourri of four distinct categories.</p>
<p><i><b><img src="sv_surv.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Type IV. </b>Low Social Costs and Low Monetary Costs. Turfs and tags. "Turfing" describes
    damage to school grounds caused by vehicles being driven across lawns or
    fields, leaving deep tread marks. Combine this with a tag or conventional
    graffiti art, or a single broken window, and you're a Type IV offender.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Type III. </b>High Social Costs but Low Monetary Costs. Hate-motivated
    or gang-related graffiti. The killing of classroom animals. Not recommended
    for beginners. </i></p>
<p><i><b>Type II. </b>Low Social Costs but High Monetary Costs. Many broken windows,
    cherry bombs dropped in a toilet, or vandalism to vending machines.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Type I. </b>High Social Costs and High Monetary Costs. The destruction
    of a media center or computer lab. The disruption or removal of school records,
    hundreds of frosty chocolate milkshakes poured into a swimming pool, or
    a form of vandalism so extreme that the school is closed and the surrounding
    community outraged or fearful.</i></p>
<p><img src="sv_trains.jpg" width="297" height="312" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" ><img src="sv_logo.gif" width="100" height="100" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" >When
  vandals
  grow weary of dismantling their school, they often migrate directly through
  your backyard. The Antelope Valley Union High School District in Lancaster,
  California supervises ten unique high schools within <b>vandalously</b> close
  proximity to the <i>Antelope Valley Model Railroad Club.</i></p>
<p>The club was founded in early 1983 to promote the hobby of model railroading
  by incorporating scenic details familiar to California. In fact, the entire
  museum is housed inside an authentic 1941 Pullman-Standard passenger car over
  eighty feet long. </p>
<p>Sometime between Christmas Day and New Year's Eve, 1995, trainspotting vandals
  removed the Eastern door port-hole window of the museum, crawled through the
  opening into the railroad car, and -- just like <i>Katamari  Damacy</i> --
  rolled over everything in sight, smashing and crunching toy trains, demolishing
  or reducing to scrap massive iron bridges and steel water tanks, razing entire
  acres of faux forest with swift kicks, laying to waste rural neighborhoods,
  and obliterating from the map sleepy-town communities with big stompy shoes. </p>
<p><img src="sv_trains2.jpg" width="442" height="292" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" >You
  read that correctly: vandals broke into a model railroad car museum modeled <i>inside</i> an
  authentic railroad car to smash up models of railroad cars. It's unknown if
  the model railroad car museum sustained any damage to its recursively-modeled
  railroad car museum, or if the miniature-modeled railroad cars <i>inside</i> the
  miniature-modeled railroad car museum were unharmed. </p>
<p>Rather than trying to
  restore the museum piece by piece from the rubble, members decided to tear
   the old layout out completely and
  renovate the passenger car by constructing a new one from scratch. It's
  a heartbreaking fact that the  injuries of vandalism often
  last a lifetime. Only by putting a more<b> human face</b> on the  walking wounded
  of the Antelope Valley Model Railroad Club can one more easily empathize
  with the tragic victims of vandalism -- school or otherwise.</p>
