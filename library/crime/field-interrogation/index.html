<h1>Field Interrogation</h1>

<p><img src="intro.jpg" width="341" height="245" hspace="10" vspace="20" align="left">For 
  decades, the training of rookie police officers has been largely an accidental 
  process. New recruits are paired with veteran patrolmen and then thrust suddenly 
  into the public view. Taking someone into custody for the first time can be 
  a thrilling experience, but what's the best way to proceed?</p>
<p>The new patrolman is often amazed by the ability of his senior partner to pluck 
  suspicious persons from a crowd and bring them down to the station with ease. 
  Although a seasoned officer might attribute these skills to experience or intuition, 
  there still exists an essential, immediate need to develop the rookie's <b>field 
  interrogation </b>technique.</p>
<p>Field interrogation, quite simply, is a <b>conversation</b> which takes place 
  in the area where you, the police officer, first encounter your proposed arrest 
  target. It can be right there on the street, in a public commercial plaza - 
  even an automobile!<br>
  <br>
  <img src="trash.jpg" width="200" height="173" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><img src="racc.jpg" width="200" height="173" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">It 
  comes across as a breezy, casual dialog which attempts to learn the identity 
  of your subject, his business in the area, and his possible connection with 
  any criminal activity, real or imagined. By way of subtle, nuanced manipulation, 
  field interrogators can effectively incarcerate individuals or entire groups 
  with laser precision.</p>
<p><b>You - the patrolman - </b>are authorized to detain any person whom you have 
  reasonable cause to suspect is committing, has committed, or is contemplating 
  committing a crime. You may demand his name, address, and occupation.<br>
  <br>
  You have the right to make inquiries of anyone on the public streets at any 
  hour, if the surroundings are such that public safety demands such identification. 
  You can arrest any person who appears to be without a visible means of support. 
  You can entice anyone into conversation and subsequently the back seat of your 
  paddy wagon easily during nighttime hours. It all starts by "tuning in" 
  to what long-time officers have come to nickname the <b><i>paranoia vibe.</i> 
  </b></p>
<p><img src="aaa.jpg" width="214" height="314" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><img src="nmb.jpg" width="295" height="295" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">As 
  a rookie, it becomes your responsibility to contort the actions, dress, and 
  location of any given person in such a way that he or she can be classified 
  as or a threat to community safety.<br>
  <br>
  Individuals who loiter near schools, playgrounds, public toilets, and swimming 
  pools may be predatory sex perverts. Men loitering near a business employing 
  women, such as telephone companies, bakeries, or hospitals, may very well be 
  muggers. <br>
  <br>
  Those loitering near clubs and bars at closing time may be <i>drunk rollers</i> 
  - individuals who specifically target intoxicated patrons fresh from the ATM 
  machine. Overweight, rubber-faced men lurking near commercial business centers 
  or shopping mall food courts during the morning hours? They could easily be 
  burglars <b>or</b> hamburglars.</p>

  you kids late for class? Looks to me like you're fleeing the scene of a crime! 
  What's in the lunchbox?</p>
<p>If you're a citizen walking down a city street, and you're observed glancing 
  briefly at a parked car, be prepared to defend yourself against accusations 
  of auto thievery. If you're a pregnant woman with an unsightly tummy bulge, 
  be prepared to get strip searched for any concealed weapons. Persons wearing 
  baggy, bulky, unsightly or off-seasonal clothing are subway taggers, skateboarders, 
  and shoplifters. Those dressed in religious garb, jingling UNICEF cans from 
  door to door are home invaders. And persons snoozing with apparent remorse in 
  door frames, atop high places, near deep water or railroad crossings? They're 
  contemplating suicide.</p>

  showing evidence of recent injury (or whose clothing is disheveled) may be perpetrators 
  of an assault or gangbang. At the scene of a fire, any persons who show excess 
  (or lack of) emotion, or those whose pants show traces of recent excitement 
  or ejaculatory splork might be pyromaniacs.</p>
<p>And it's widely known within the department that well over ninety-five percent 
  of incarcerated subjects <b>don't own a wristwatch. </b>This phenomenon is explained 
  by the fact that persons fitting the criminal archetype rarely care about the 
  hour of the day. They're largely unemployed or otherwise unconcerned with a 
  the concept fo maintaining a regular schedule. Some can't even tell you what 
  day of the week it is! Can you imagine that?</p>
<p><b><img src="fist.jpg" width="200" height="104" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Tattoos</b> 
  on your subject offer immediate, physical indications of previous crime habits 
  and indicate future criminal intent. Juvenile and adult gang members alike tattoo 
  themselves during incarceration, and a knowledge of this ritual (as well as 
  the meaning of specific symbols or patterns encountered) will undoubtedly aid 
  you as you pursue more and more arrests.</p>
<p>	<b>Jailhouse tattoos </b>may be distinguished from a professional tattoo 
  in several ways. The professional tattoo will exhibit finer, more distinct, 
  black outlines. The professional tattoo will have depth, style, clarity. The 
  overall design will exhibit both exquisite form and believable proportion. The 
  professional tattoo artist will usually never place a tattoo on the hands or 
  face, nor will the professional indulge in lewd patterns, swear words, Nazi 
  iconography, and the like.</p>

<p>Because inks are not obtainable in prison, inmates are limited by dyes or tints 
  which can be improvised. Newspaper print from the Sunday funnies are often scraped 
  and soaked in a communal toilet. This produces a liquid which can be dried later 
  on to obtain crude ink. </p>
<p><img src="belly.jpg" width="250" height="360" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><img src="tatman.jpg" width="250" height="355" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">An 
  ordinary safety pin is the instrument most often used for tattooing in prison. 
  These crude instruments produce readily distinguishable tattoos, but piss-poor 
  inks always yield wide or diffused lines and blue-greenish discoloration.</p>
<p>	Certain patterns and locations for tattooing can indicate both a criminal 
  lifestyle <b>and</b> ongoing intent to defraud society.<br>
  <br>
  The tattooing of four-letter words across the knuckles of the hand is universally 
  found, as are expressions of self-pity on the chest and other parts of the body.<br>
  <br>
  Tattoos on the inner arm are usually designed to conceal needle marks, and some 
  patterns are inherent to specific cultures, such as the heroin addict's "Linux 
  penguin" often found below the right shoulder or above the buttocks.</p>
<p><img src="drag.jpg" width="225" height="256" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Keep 
  in mind, a subject's refusal to answer your questions about his tattoos, in 
  and of itself, is one circumstance which allows you to arrest him for <b>vagrancy</b>.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has declared it's the duty of every citizen, when called 
  upon, to disclose all the personal information in his power to the police. And 
  fortunately, in states like Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, the length 
  of a field interrogation can last up to two hours.<br>
  <br>
  While such prolonged detention is neither considered an arrest, nor recorded 
  in any official record, it allows for large groups to be incarcerated in a single 
  afternoon shift. Don't waste too much time! There are plenty of other subjects 
  out there to choose from.<br>
  <br>
  <i>"Other <b>subjects?</b>"</i><br>
  <br>
  That's right, Officer McFlibbity-Jibbit! I said <i>subjects</i>, not suspects.</p>
<p><i><img src="vent2.jpg" width="250" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">"But 
  why?"</i><br>
  <br>
  Because as the required information is being gleaned, it's supremely important 
  that <b>the field interrogation process not feel like an arrest.<br>
  <br>
  </b><i>"But why?"</i><b><br>
  <br>
  </b> Because that's what differentiates a field interrogation from a legitimate 
  interrogation.<br>
  <br>
  <i>"Help, help! This guy's got a hand up my ass! Hey lady - wanna see a 
  <b>woodpecker?</b>"</i><br>
  <br>
  Oh, Officer McFlibbity-Jibbit! You'll be the death of us all! But it's true: 
  some subjects need to be treated differently than others. If your arrest quota 
  reflects a low average, try tailoring your repertoire of <b>field interrogation 
  techniques</b> to fit other special circumstances.</p>
<p>For instance, an intoxicated person always warrants investigation. It should 
  be remembered that a drunk usually loses any fear or apprehension of authority 
  he may have had when sober, and for this reason believes himself invulnerable 
  to threats and unimpressed with the officer's presence.</p>

<p>Like homosexuals, such persons can be most susceptible to flattery and sympathy 
  - especially if an officer intimates that (a) the victims were clearly tempting 
  the suspect, or (b) hints at the possibility of some kind of blowjob/confession 
  <b><img src="t2.jpg" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></b>exchange 
  program. Down at the station, of course! </p>
<p><b><img src="t1.jpg" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Mentally 
  defective,</b> feeble minded, senile, or psychotic persons are perfect subjects 
  for field interrogation. However, an officer must be sure to simplify his vocabulary 
  and use short questions as required by the subject's span of attention. The 
  use of <i><b>questions</b></i> must be avoided because they only produce erroneous 
  answers. Often a retarded person raised in a criminal environment will barely 
  understand popular vernacular.<br>
  <br>
  In these cases, the interrogation will be successful only if the patrolman shouts 
  at the top of his lungs or enunciates slowly.</p>
<p><img src="bj.jpg" width="300" height="241" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The 
  questioning of <b>ethnic minorities</b> is a very sensitive subject, indeed 
  one which requires careful study, great patience, and practice, practice, practice. 
  A belligerent attitude must be avoided, and usually only a friendly or sympathetic 
  approach produces the desired results. The most successful method of interrogating 
  persons of color is for an officer to make the subject feel as if he or she 
  is being verbally beaten down like a <b>suburban white kid </b>who's only <i>emulating</i> 
  the subtle cultural nuances of a minority group.<br>
  <br>
  The only other legitimate inference (to be drawn purely by skin tone) is to 
  compare the claimed occupation of a subject with the degree to which his skin 
  is tanned. A gentleman who claims to work at Starbucks would not be expected 
  to have a dark sun tan or a weather-beaten face; while a dock worker or telephone 
  lineman for Pacific Bell would have just such a complexion.</p>
<p>You should be prepared for a variety of reactions when you approach someone 
  for interrogation. Occasionally, your target may exhibit an overly friendly, 
  even <b>child-like</b> attitude, punctuating his conversation with an excess 
  of "no sir" and "yes sir" replies in a desperate attempt to show respect and 
  obtain your favor. Overly solicitous juveniles should be incarcerated with extreme 
  prejudice. Further conversation may reveal that he uses the word "sir" in excess 
  only because prior stretches in prison have <i>trained him</i> against the dangers 
  of becoming someone else's property.</p>

<p><img src="lech.jpg" width="250" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">An 
  officer should <i>never</i> attempt to conduct field interrogation on a <b>female 
  subject</b> when he's alone. As a general rule, women become far more angry 
  at being selected for interrogation than their male counterparts. In retaliation, 
  female subjects suspected of prostitution can claim you made improper advances, 
  or were abusive in some fashion.<br>
  <br>
  Two of the primary defenses used by female subjects during interrogation are 
  <b>fake tears</b> and <b>sexual favors</b>. The former should be understood 
  and the latter ignored. Tears are induced by frequently touching the eyelids 
  and the officer should note whether the subject used a handkerchief before or 
  after the tears were manufactured. <i>Refrain from sex with your female subjects 
  altogether</i> by masturbating before your shift.</p>
<p><img src="lie.jpg" width="211" height="168" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">And then there's lying. The 
  truth is, everyone lies! A word-for-word repetition of an <b>untruthful person's</b> 
  story indicates an overly-prepared alibi. Such a narrative unravels if you ask 
  the subject to repeat it backwards. The most successful method of handling someone 
  who lies is to point out all the obvious signs of his untruthfulness. Each physiological 
  indication of lying should be mentioned directly: dry mouth, excessive perspiration, 
  a change in facial color, continual swallowing, twitching lips, a noticeable 
  pulse beat in the temples, or dark stains spreading slowly across the trousers. 
  Call his immediate attention to cliched statements such as "I swear on my mother's 
  grave," or, "you're standing on my neck."</p>
<p><img src="kid.jpg" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">A 
  brand new cop in a brand new uniform may feel reluctant to place people under 
  arrest, for fear of being called "eager" by older, less energetic officers. 
  But the arrest artists who are most successful at field interrogation have trained 
  themselves in the required techniques. The i<img src="arrested.jpg" width="250" height="190" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">ncreasing 
  ability of an officer to conduct field interrogation depends on the extent to 
  which he combines natural curiosity and experimentation with good old fashioned 
  don't-give-a-shitsmanship.</p>
<p>Yes, it <b>can</b> be difficult for a rookie to learn the art of arrest from 
  his seasoned partner. Often the senior officer may not have mastered the techniques 
  himself, or he may not possess the instructional ability required to relay the 
  necessary information. Don't let a veteran office who's grown lazy over time 
  dominate these interrogations, or prevent you from gaining experience.</p>

</table>
<p>Problems occur only when the senior officer does not - or cannot - explain 
  why he singled out a certain subject for questioning. Experienced patrolmen 
  might attribute selection of subjects to something as intangible as a "hunch," 
  while others conceal their secrets in an attempt to mystify you. With new jails 
  being built every month, now more than ever what's needed is a daily commitment 
  to <b>being your own officer. </b>Our citizens demand airtight dedication to 
  filling our woefully unpopulated prison cells and holding tanks, one criminal 
  at a time.</p>
