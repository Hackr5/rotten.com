<h1>McDonald's</h1>

<img src="/library/crime/corporate/mcdonalds/too-many-happy-meals.jpg" height="351" width="496" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>

Anyone who's ever consumed a Shamrock shake and reveled in how it transformed the color of their <a href="/library/medicine/bodily-functions/shitting/">feces</a> has experienced the alchemy of McDonald's food. But the cuisine is not without its detractors.
<p>

Synonymous with mass-marketed crap, McDonald's is generally reviled as lowest common denominator fare. Greasy, salty foodstuffs concocted to satisfy your most unhealthy gastronomic cravings in the maximally-profitable manner. It is cheap, ubiquitous, and marketed to the working class. All of which makes it the perfect target for budding culture snobs.
<p>

As such, people commonly bitch that McDonald's is selling "junk food" -- substandard fare, marginally suitable for human consumption -- as if its customers are somehow hypnotized into buying food that doesn't really appeal to them. Which is bullshit. McDonald's delivers a consistent, if somewhat bland, product that competes quite well in the marketplace. If people didn't want Big Macs and <a href="/library/culture/french-fries/">french fries</a>, they wouldn't buy them.
<p>

Most people who hate McDonald's are really just anti-establishment wannabes. Maybe they were raised by hippie parents, maybe they listened to a lot of punk rock in high school, or maybe they're pretentious jerks. Whatever the issue, these people feel compelled to reject the modern-day corporatocracy, but deep down they know there's no way they could live a whole month without Starbucks or Comedy Central. Rather than admit to themselves their complete and utter dependence upon the evil capitalist system, they draw the line somewhere arbitrary, so they can make a meaningless stand:

Feel free to slam McDonald's, but you should resist the urge to blindly rail against their product offerings. Especially when there are plenty of good reasons to oppose the multinational corporation behind them.
<p>

First of all, the company can't be trusted to keep its own story straight. Consider the lionization of <a href="/library/bio/business/ray-kroc/">Ray Kroc</a>. Kroc's business card bore just his name, the golden arches, and the word "Founder." Except that Richard and Maurice McDonald were the actual founders. By the time Ray Kroc entered the picture, the McDonald brothers had already opened eight restaurants. Kroc joined on as their franchise agent. (Ever wonder why it isn't called Kroc's?) But he bought them out six years later for $2.7 million and went on to minimize their role in the official company history.
<p>

"Sometimes after reading excerpts from an article on McDonald's, I began to wonder if the McDonald brothers ever had <i>anything</i> to do with the success of McDonald's," observed Richard McDonald. "During the years from the time we first met Ray Kroc in 1954 and hired him in 1955 to be our franchise agent, there was never any mention over the years that Ray was founder of McDonald's. However, after we sold to Ray and his associates, he was elevated to be the founder."
<p>

As far as megalomaniacal Ray Kroc was concerned, there was one problem with the buyout arrangement: it allowed the McDonald brothers to maintain ownership of the original McDonald's restaurant in San Bernardino, California at 14th and E Street. So what did Ray Kroc do? First he forced them to change the name of their restaurant (which became "The Big M"). Then he opened a McDonald's franchise as quickly as possible just one block away at 15th and E, purposely driving the McDonald brothers out of business. This event illustrates not only Ray's overweening vanity, but also his single-minded philosophy about competing in the fast food industry:
<p>

<blockquote><font size=-1>
"It is ridiculous to call this an industry. This is not. This is rat eat
rat, dog eat dog. I'll kill 'em, and I'm going to kill 'em before they
kill me. You're talking about the American way -- of survival of the fittest."

Around the world, the McDonald's Corporation serves as a glaring reminder of U.S. hegemony. The restaurants are themselves seen as outposts of American corporate culture. And their relentless encroachment into new regions has caused a huge backlash from globalization foes and people who distrust anything originating in the United States... not to mention legions of vegetarians, environmentalists, labor organizers, wannabe anarchists, and elitist food critics. And so, the fast food chain suffers a relentless onslaught from these forces as well.
<p>

But none of that is any reason they deserve your pity. The multinational hamburger empire has repeatedly abused its substantial power, thereby pissing away any claim to moral superiority.

Ray Kroc wrote <a href="/library/bio/business/walt-disney/">Walt Disney</a> a letter in 1954:
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
Dear Walt,
<p>

I feel somewhat presumptuous addressing you in this way. Yet I am sure you would not want me to address you any other way ... My name is Ray A. Kroc ... I look over the Company A picture we had taken in Sound Beach, Conn. many times and recall a lot of pleasant memories.
<p>

I have very recently taken over the national franchise of the McDonald's system. I would like to inquiry if there may be an opportunity for a McDonald's in your Disneyland Development.
