This sham corporation, dedicated to Mammon, was headed by a CEO whose close personal friend was President <a href="/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">George W Bush</a>. Although Bush denied it in a 2001 interview:
<p>

<blockquote>
"He was a supporter of Ann Richards in my run in 1994, and she did name him the head of the Governor's Business Council, and I decided to leave him in place just for the sake of continuity. And that's when I first got to know Ken and worked with Ken, and he supported my candidacy."
</blockquote>
<p>

As a matter of fact, Enron contributed a grand total of $550,000 to Bush over an eight-year period. That made Enron the single largest contributor to Bush's political career.
<p>

Enron's ostensible business model involved selling electrical power and energy commodities, and gleaning a percentage from the transactions. Of course, their primary source of income ultimately turned out to be graft.

Skilling was standing on the corner of Park Avenue and East 73rd Street: highly intoxicated, uncooperative, and making accusations at passers-by.  <i>"You're an FBI agent and you're following me,"</i> he was reported as shrieking. He ran up to several patrons in a Manhattan bar and "pulled open" their clothes. Police took Skilling to the New York Presbyterian Hospital for observation.</font></td>
