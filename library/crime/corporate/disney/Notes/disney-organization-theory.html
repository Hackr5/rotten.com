<H2>Organization Theory and the Walt Disney Company</H2>
<HR>

<P>
In the early 1980's the Walt Disney Company was in a state of
mismanaged disarray. Profits were low and steadily dropping as
the decade progressed. This year, the Walt Disney Company posted
earnings of 7.5 billion dollars, up from 98 million in 1984 (Eisner,
1992). What turned around Disney has been the subject of several
books and has been discussed in popular literature. Here, I want
to examine this turnaround in terms of Disney as an organization.
Organization theory offers an interesting framework by which to
analyze the changes that occurred in the company.
<P>
In order to understand what made the turnaround possible, it is
important to see what brought the Disney Company to such a state
of shambles in the first place. The history of the organization
can be divided into four overlapping stages: Walt, Deity, Vacuum,
and Eisner.
<P>
The Walt stage is first. Between 1946 and 1964, Walt Disney rode
the baby boom generation to create a hugely successful entertainment
corporation. From the beginning the company was built on the success
of its own products. Walt's early Silly Symphonies paid for the
early Mickey Cartoons which paid for the first full length animated
feature which paid for the first live action -adventures and so
on (Flower, p.16). This building process was certainly not unique
to Disney; however, the process that followed it was.
<P>
In the early 1950's, Walt began to campaign vigorously to create
Disneyland. Roy Disney, Walt's older brother and financial manager
of the business, was strongly opposed to the idea because of its
risky return. Walt was forced to find the money to open the park
himself, eventually turning to a deal with ABC which would form
the beginning of the Disney synergy. In exchange for a 34 percent
interest in the business and loan guarantees, Disney agreed to
produce a weekly program called &quot;Disneyland&quot; for the
struggling network. No other studio had ventured into television
previously so this was new in itself; however, the results were
extraordinary. After the park opened in 1955, the television program
became an advertisement for the parks and the new films. The films
encouraged people to visit the parks and tune in to the program
while the parks built up good will for the company and encouraged
people to relive the experience through the television programs
and films (Flower, p.16). These cross connections formed the basis
of an entertainment conglomerate which, in another first for the
entertainment industry, was based on a company name. Even in the
heyday of the major studios, no production company had the name
recognition Disney had from the beginning. The synergy of the
television programs and parks fed this name-recognition even more.
<P>
From a business standpoint the structure was sheer genius. However,
from an organizational standpoint, it had the potential to be
a nightmare. The different divisions, competing for resources
and in interests, had to work together to create the synergy which
made the Disney company work. In its early days, one thing allowed
this synergy to function: Walt.
<P>
It is surprising to find a creative genius like Walt, succeeding
in a business environment. In part, his success was built on Roy
Disney's conservative financial planning which prevented Walt
from running with each new project he considered. However, Walt
was also a surprisingly good organizer on his own. Joe Flower,
in <U>Prince of the Magic Kingdom</U>, notes:
<P>
Genius often renders the artist nearly or completely incapable
of working through an organization. Walt Disney's peculiar madness
took just the opposite turn: he demonstrated four abilities any
great leader possesses- creativity, energy, communication, and
inspiration (Flower, p.24).
<P>
However, the organization he created was indicative of some lack
of traditional organizational skills. Virtually no hierarchy or
division of labor existed in the early Disney organization. The
rational systems approach would find that the company should not
have been able to function at all. Almost everyone involved with
running the company besides Walt was a &quot;staff writer&quot;
with no defined responsibilities. However, a natural systems perspective
reveals that the informal relationships between these men created
a tight and effective management structure where slack was quickly
picked up. This management structure was almost completely the
result of its leader. Walt micro managed every detail of the operations
of the company. He would read and edit individual scripts, supervise
films, manage the parks, and run the television production company.
A Los Angeles Times reporter once asked Walt what was the most
rewarding of his experiences. He replied, &quot;The whole damn
thing. The fact that I was able to build and organization and
hold it (Flower, p.21).&quot; Everyone in the organization answered
to Walt and Walt ran the organization and imbued it with a culture
of quality that grew naturally from his own notion of the company.
The management structure was a flat-hierarchy with Walt leading
and controlling everyone below, and with everyone below on an
almost flat plane.
<P>
Thr trouble with this sort of organization seems to be in its
potential for perpetuity. Walt died on December 14, 1966 leaving
much of the world in tears, and leaving an organization he had
created and controlled form day one. The question became: could
anyone run the organization like Walt?
<P>
The second phase of the Disney organization was the religious
one. Without Walt, the plan for organization was simple and obvious:
make believe he wasn't dead. Needless to say, it didn't work.
Immediately after Walt's death, the company emabarked on a management
strategy grounded in the question: what would Walt have done?
All the individuals in the company seemed to have different ideas
about the answers, so the separate interests within the company
began to battle. This strategy was crystalized by later imagineer
then teacher Randy Bright's boss, a leader at the Disney University,
who pioneered, &quot;the Walt Disney Tradition,&quot; a training
program based on keeping Walt's traditions alive (Flower, p.50).
<P>
This system was unable to fill the space left by Walt's death.
Walt was an autocratic visionary and ran the organization in that
way. The &quot;shop-floor&quot; interactions between Walt and
his subordinates led people with Walt's qualities to leave the
organization: they could not compete. This created even greater
problems of leadership after his death. Flower writes:
<P>
Although Walt Disney Productions was a large organization...its
personality was an extension of Walt himself. Without him the
company was leaderless, and in some ways, brain dead. There was
no one who could take his place. He had shaped the organization
to meet his own needs (p.50).
<P>
It was in this environment that Roy Disney was forced to try to
keep WDC working and growing. Not being a dynamic leader and shirking
from decision-making, Roy tried to institute a rational-hierarchical
structure into the organization. He formed a committee system
which was supposed to oversee and coordinate the various aspects
of the company. However, the committees had no leadership and
in a creativity-based enterprise, decisions were difficult to
agree on. In organization structure, the system resembled, &quot;the
Roman Catholic Church, but without a Pope (Flwoer, p.51).&quot;
<P>
The committee structure proved ineffective. The committee of the
imagineers was unable to agree upon new designs. Further, the
competing interests of the various subdivisions were battling
constantly with no one to mediate and guide. For instance, the
ride operators were concerned with speed, turn-over, and ease
of maintenance. Conversely, the imagineers were concerned with
the overall quality of the experience. The competitions between
them were simply not addressed properly by a committee system
without a creative leader to make decisions. Ward Kimball, a Disney
Animator, indicated, &quot;any organization that was built by
one man, one man's tastes and choices, will have a tough time
adjusting to the rule of the committee where decisions are split
among a group of people (Flower, p.51).&quot;
<P>
In some ways, it was organizational inertiathat prevented the
system from working. It was not impossible for a committee system
to effectively run a creative enterprise like Disney; however,
the organization was simply not poised for such a transition.
It still craved the single-leader model and the power vacuum that
followed led to serious problems.
<P>
In the years that followed, the organization began to decline
further. These power vacuum years are particularly interesting
from an organizational standpoint. Early in the paper, the synergy
of the company was discussed. In the years since Walt died this
synergy had grown in necessity and breadth, but declined in quality.
The Disney company now had interests in consumer products, real
estate development, licensing, television animation, and television
production as well as its interests in film production, the theme
parks, and the original television program. The hierarchical structure
created in the next 20 years was completely unable to use this
synergy to the company's benefit.
<P>
A series of CEO's and CFO's were reasonably good financial managers,
but all lacked the creative direction the company had had under
Walt. In addition, they lacked the dynamic ability Walt had to
keep the parts of the organization connected. While Walt was dealing
with a significantly smaller organization, there was no question
that the connections between Disney's parts must be reestablished
if the company was to thrive.
<P>
The late 1970's brought a new series of managers and wiring diagrams;
however, they seemed to be ineffective. The hierarchical system
that was imposed, in combination with a still existing corporate
culture which relied on one individual to handle the synergy,
were ineffective in revitalizing the company.
<P>
Thus, in the early 1980's the company was still coasting on its
early successes but declining quickly. In 1984, the situation
drastically changed and two organizational problems presented
themselves. Saul Steinberg (the Jew who almost killed Disney)
began to buy significant amounts of Disney stock. The assumption
of the press, the public, and the Disney management, was that
Steinberg was going to attempt a hostile takeover and sell of
the individual parts of the company to the highest bidders. While
this may or may not have been the case, Disney management made
moves which actually forced Steinberg into a position where he
had almost no choice but to do so.
<P>
From an organization theory perspective, this interchange was
interesting because its showed the ineptitude of Disney executives
in dealing with real-world financial matters. The corporate culture
of Disney, which was concerned utmost with buffering the core
technology of Disney entertainment, also buffered the executives
from the outside business world. Disney executives often felt
that they were above such petty business dealings; however, the
risk of the end of the Disney Company was clearly real (p.102-105).
<P>
On another level, the takeover possibility seemed to tell something
more about the nature of the Disney company that I think has been
unadressed in the literature. In a hindrance-free market, bargaining
theory would indicate that the individual parts of a corporation,
if unrelated, would always be salable to someone who valued them
more highly. In the case of Disney, its parts were worth more
then its whole. This would not have been possible if the Disney
synergy had still existed. Had the parts been working together
towards unified goals, they would have been more valuable as a
whole then in their parts. Thus, the fact that Disney was ripe
for takeover was not merely a result of bad management of its
finances, but more directly a result of bad management of the
interactions of the various aspects of the company.
<P>
Disney employed a variety of buffering strategies in its interactions
with a series of corporate takeover-artists. Disney swallowed
a poison pill in the form of a greeting card company to artificially
value the stock. Disney also tried to dilute the stock with the
purchase of Arvida, a land development company. In the end however,
it was an outside White Knight in the form of the Bass Brother
Investment Company that saved Disney. They saw the potential for
the company under the right management and decided to reorganize
it and keep it together.
<P>
Mike Eisner and Frank Wells became the CEO and CFO of the Disney
Company in late 1984. Immediately they began implementing changes
which may well have saved the company. First, at Roy Disney's
suggestion, they began to rebuild the animation department. While
this strategy would take 6 years to pay-off, its end results were
staggering. Animation also helped increase attendance at the theme
parks by creating the materials for new attractions. Disney also
ventured back into television animation, a connection which also
helped fuel attendance at Disney films and theme parks as well
as leading to increased merchandising.
<P>
One problem Eisner faced was the need to produce non-Disney films
in order to show a profit. He proposed an organizational solution.
The company created Touchstone pictures, a division of WDC which
had no name affiliation with Disney. Through this company, the
studios were able to release a series of staggeringly successful
films without tarnishing the Disney image. Later, this would be
followed by the creation of Hollywood Pictures, another hidden-Mickey
studio.
<P>
Eisner also brought back the Sunday night television program,
an indication of his understanding of the need to coordinate the
activities of the various companies. It is telling that this was
one of his first tasks as CEO. Eisner began a series of policies
designed to recreate the synergy between the divisions. These
included hierarchical changes; however, they were primarily connected
to Eisner himself. In other words, Eisner became the first leader
able to replace Walt. He shared Walt's dynamism and ability to
see the company globally.
<P>
A rational systems perspective would not indicate significant
changes in the company when it began its rise in the second half
of the 80's. However, a natural systems perspective would reveal
that Eisner had been the first leader of the company since Walt
to merge organizational skills, a talent for entertainment, and
an understanding of the function of the company.
<P>
Eisner's changes in the hierarchical structure of Disney are difficult
to examine. It seems clear that some new executive positions were
created with the development of the new studios. However, for
the most part, the structure had not changed significantly. On
a natural level though, Eisner hired superb executives to fill
the important posts (Katzenberg). At the same time, some executives
who had been unable to work effectively under the old regime,
found Eisner to be more receptive to their ideas (Nunis). This
was mostly a function of Eisner himself. Variously described as
a risk-taker, high strung, and a lunatic, his hyperactive management
style seemed to fit the company perfectly. More importantly, Eisner
began to reinstate the synergy of the elements of Disney into
the corporate culture. And, while sometimes a micro manager like
Walt, has instilled a sense of hierarchical organization into
the company. There is a clear sense that Disney is a business
now and its executives treat it as such.
<P>
Two last interesting questions exist for Disney from the perspective
of organization theory. The first is a buffering problem. Disney
has always relied on extensive buffering of its core technology
so as not to dilute the magic. The company hates to explain its
technological achievements and makes sure the mouse is not used
in any un-licensed venues. Further, there is a sense that people
think of Disney, not as a business making a profit, but as a benevolent
charity existing for their happiness. This image is important
to the goodwill Disney has as a company and has always been protected
by the organization.
<P>
Until recently, part of this buffering involved limiting the venues
in which Disney entertainments could be consumed. From the seven
year re-release program with no television release for films,
to a limited consumer products line and relatively low visibility,
Disney had sometimes seemed to function on the idea that scarcity
of the mouse protected his value.
<P>
When Eisner took power, this strategy seemed to reverse. Disney
consumer products are now prevalent and the release of the films
to video (while an ingenious marketing decision) may hay have
long-range implications for the re-release of the classic films.
Disney can now be enjoyed, more then ever, in a variety of entertainment
venues. Further, as they become more prevalent, there is risk
of lowering quality. Already, Disney licenses its characters to
thousands of products, now readily available at every discounter
and grocery store. However, it is possible that these sorts of
products may actually increase people's appetite for the more
economically important Disney entertainments (movies and parks).
In terms of the theme parks, Disney's haste in opening the Disney-MGM
studios resulted in a quality-loss. In racing to open before Universal,
Disney opened what many believed was a marginal attraction However,
people have overfilled its capacity from day one.
<P>
Still, the problem is a reasonable one and can be looked at in
terms of buffering strategies. Eisner made the judgment that too
much buffering of the core technology was economically inefficient.
However, there probably exists some point at which the increasing
number of Disney entertainments actually represent a marginal
decrease in total revenue for the company. However, Eisner cannot
simply stop making Disney entertainment and tell the board of
directors that they have reached the limit. The American business
organization is not designed to function in that way. While Disney
can expand into other non-Disney labeled business ventures, the
power of the Disney name still poses a problem for the company.
<P>
The other interesting organization perspective on the company
is the extent to which Disney had tried to account for uncertainty
in its task environment in recent months. In a new buffering and
boundary spanning strategy, Walt Disney World will no longer offer
tickets which allow guests to &quot;hop&quot; between the parks
on one day. Only guests who stay at Disney hotels can purchase
these park-hopping passports. Disney hopes to encourage guests
to stay in their own hotels through this strategy. By controlling
the &quot;entire&quot; Disney experience the company hopes guests
will enjoy their stay more, and spend all of their money within
the confines of WDW. Disney seems to be forcing its guests to
view it as a vertical organization, controlling every aspect of
the vacation experience.
<P>
In conclusion, the organizational question Disney must now address
is: what will the company be like after Eisner. In my opinion
it will be stable. The most important reason for this is that
Disney is now a traditional hierarchical organization and its
corporate culture reflects that. While Eisner provided the impetus
to reconnect and restart the company, the organization had already
developed. However, this organization had not found its way into
the corporate culture of Disney because of the lack of success
of the company in those years. While Eisner makes many of the
decision revolving the company, many others are made by other
competent people in other executive posts. Further, the links
between the companies are firmly reestablished and seem to be
a significant part of the company's long-term strategy. When Walt
died, it was almost as if no one else in the company understood
the linkages between its operations. Now, those links are firmly
established and understood. No new movie is considered without
an understanding of its marketing potential in consumer products
and its possible relation to theme park development. Thus, I think
the company will survive if Uncle Eisner ever decides to leave.
