<h1>Groping</h1>

<p>On a crowded subway train, perhaps the only thing more delightful than brushing
  up against the odd bit of  tit is that half-pint of anonymous buttock
  you've got clenched in your fist like a Nerf football. <i>Groping</i> historically
  implies acting with uncertainty, reaching about blindly in the dark with hesitance
  or demonstrating a lack of confidence -- but we'll not make that mistake here
  today.</p>
<p>It's the American version of <i>frottage </i>-- a concept the French
  have known about for centuries -- in which one massages
  or <b>rubs </b>the
  body part of another to attain sexual gratification. The
  name is derived from an artistic technique attributed to Max Ernst,
  in which a charcoal pencil is laid across paper and scratched back and forth
  over a textured surface. </p>
<p>Celebrities, politicians, and groping go together like short skirts and mirrored
  wingtips. Actor <b>Christian Slater</b> was busted in May
  of 2005 for "forcibly
  touching the sexual [and other intimate] parts of another person for the purposes
  of degradation and abusement" as she stood in line to buy a soda. The
  woman indicated that he pumped up <b>more than just than her volume,</b> grabbing
  her round, ripe fanny in a manner so disturbing she was prompted to flag down
  a cop car. Police found him intoxicated a few blocks away, and placed him in
  handcuffs. "I
  didn't do anything," quipped
  the star of <i>Untamed
  Heart</i> to an assembled throng. Charges
  against Slater were later dropped after he threatened to sue his arresting
officer and the New York City Police Department.</p>
<p>As <b>Arnold Schwarzenegger</b> attempted to thrust his governor campaign
  into high gear during the California recall elections of 2003, allegations
  of <i><b><img src="g_arnold3.jpg" width="301" height="330" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" ></b></i>improper
  touching grew so extreme he was nicknamed the <i><b>Gropinator</b></i>.
  As many as <b>fifteen</b> women
  stepped forward to share their stories, including an unidentified 51-year-old
  who said Schwarzenegger "pinned her to him and spanked her repeatedly at a
  West Los Angeles post-production studio". <b>Three</b> other women named
  by the <i>Los
  Angeles Times</i> said Schwarzenegger fondled them in separate incidents outside
  a Venice gym in the mid 1980s, at a bar in the late 1970s and on the set of
  the movie <i>Predator</i> in
  1986. The day after that story broke, <b>six</b> women came forward to claim
  they were groped them between 1975 and 2000 -- including two
  dames who said Arnold harassed them on the set of the movie <i>Twins</i>.</p>
<p>E. Laine Stockton claimed Schwarzenegger came
  up from behind her, reached under her T-shirt, honked her breast -- and 
  then silently walked away. "I was just shocked, shocked to the point where
  I almost didn't know how to react, because it was so out of the blue and so
  unexpected," she
  told <i>The Times</i>. Another woman alleged Arnold pulled her into his lap
  and whispered "vulgarities" as other men watched and smiled. </p>
<p><img src="g_groper.jpg" width="150" height="235" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >The groping
  reports could not have come at a worse time in Schwarzenegger's campaign, already
  under attack for reports that he praised <a href="/library/bio/nazi/adolf-hitler/">Adolf Hitler</a> as a youth. He stopped
  short of denying  the women's accounts, insisting none of them told
  him (at the time) that he "went over the line." Schwarzenegger voluntarily
  took a training course about sexual harassment after winning the California
  election. He extended his apologies live to an enormous audience:</p>
<p><i>"I want to prove to the women that I will be a champion
  for the women, a champion of the women. Yes, I have behaved badly some times,
  yes it is true that I was on rowdy movie sets and I have done things that were
  not right which I thought then was playful but now I recognize that I offended
  people. Those people that I have offended, I want to say to them I am deeply
  sorry about that and I apologize because that's not what I'm trying to do."</i></p>
<p><i><img src="g_scarlett.jpg" width="470" height="335" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" ></i>Speaking of queers, on live television during the 2005 Golden Globe
  Awards, fashion designer <b>Isaac
    Mizrahi</b> groped,
    squeezed, fondled and paid complements to the lovely and talented tits belonging
    to <b>Scarlett Johannson,</b> both of
which were displayed effortlessly in a skintight red Valentino dress. "I
just wanna feel it," he squealed into the microphone. "Oh, I just love that."</p>
<p>That
    same night, Mizrahi tugged on <b>Teri Hatcher's</b> bronze halter top to
    look for hidden, folded-up notes: "Come on, you've got to have the speech
    somewhere." Hatcher then screamed <i>OH MY GOD HE TOUCHED MY STOMACH
    AND PULLED DOWN MY DRESS</i> to no one in particular. Later, Mizrahi would
    inquire of <b>Eva Longoria</b> what her hair was like "down there" and
    ask <b>Jessica Alba</b> if she was wearing any underwear. Finally, he asked <b>Charlize
    Theron</b> about her Oscar-winning role as "a scary dyke with bad teeth".
Mizrahi suffered no lasting backlash.</p>
<p>Others are not so lucky. <b>Galen Fox,</b> former Republican state representative
  of Hawaii and state House minority leader was ordered in January of 2006 to
  register as a <b>sex offender</b> after being convicted of a mile-high grope.
  During a five hour flight, Fox slipped his fingers under a blanket to fondle
  a sleeping 27-year-old-woman's thighs and tweak her puss-puss. "I have
  a right to sleep on a plane without being groped," the victim wrote. Fox
  acknowledged that his "entire
  career had been ruined," and his life shattered. </p>
<p><img src="g_clinton2.jpg" width="398" height="275" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >Former Commander in Chief <a href="/library/bio/presidents/bill-clinton/">Bill Clinton</a> regularly found himself at the center
  of grab-and-grope hearings during the terms of his presidency. During a 1998
  interview with <i>60
  Minutes,</i> former
  White House volunteer Kathleen Willey reminisced about an particularly awkward
  encounter. Willey alleged that while she and Clinton were alone in his private
  study near the Oval Office, Clinton embraced her tightly, kissed her on the
  mouth, fondled her breast and placed her hand <b>on his balls.</b></p>
<p><i>"I just remember
  thinking what in the world is he doing? I was just startled. I thought, well,
  maybe I ought to give him a good slap across the face. And then I thought,
  I don't think you can slap the president of the United States like that. I
  just could not believe that had happened in the Oval Office. I just could not
  believe the recklessness of that act. There are Secret Service people around,
  there are stewards around, his staff was around."</i></p>
<p><img src="g_clintongrope.gif" width="318" height="238" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Clinton
  was shocked and bewildered by Willey's allegations according to lead lawyer
  Bob Bennett. He emphatically denied the charges -- but later said that he <i>may</i> have
  kissed her on the forehead in an effort to console her about a job. Attorney
  Gloria Steinem, who steadfastly defended Clinton in opinion columns during
  the sexual harassment hearings, shaped an argument for limited groping liability
  -- the <b>One
  Free Grope</b> rule: "He's accused of having made a gross,
  dumb and reckless pass at a supporter during a low point in her life. She pushed
  him away and it never happened again. In other words, President
  Clinton took no for an answer."</p>
<p>Groping is an epidemic in Japan, where crowded city streets and subway cars
  conceal thousands of eager hands. In July of 2005, the CIA released a report
  which approximated the Japanese population at 128 million. Of these, only <i>nine</i> million
  are females aged zero to fourteen, leaving 42 million potential groping victims
  between the ages of 15 and 64.  </p>
<p><img src="g_chikan.jpg" width="500" height="375" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >Close to 2,200 instances of Japanese groping were reported in 2005, resulting
  in 416 arrests, an increase of <b>eight percent</b> from 2004. In recent years, train
  operators have introduced the concept of <i>women-only</i> subway cars labeled
  with pink stickers, but the service is limited to a mere handful of destinations
  and operate during reduced hours. </p>
<p>In major metropolitan cities like Osaka, Japanese authorities have started
  using forensic techniques which analyze fabric fiber evidence 
  in an ongoing effort to curtail subway gropers. The <b>Osaka Prefectural Police</b>  apply
  a special film to a suspect's palm, collecting tiny microfibers no longer than
  a hundredth of a millimeter in size. Using a powerful microscope, the fiber
  samples can be compared with a victim's clothing.</p>
<p><i><img src="g_honk.jpg" width="240" height="180" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" ></i>"Japanese
  men have been getting away with this for many years, and I think I've seen
  some instances over the years," quoted one Canadian-Japanese
scholar to <i>Osaka Day</i>. "It is disgusting." </p>
<p>Robert Marquand of <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> reports that at peak
  hours during Tokyo commutes, crowded subway cars can reach above <b>160
  percent</b> capacity. The lack of standing space translates directly into prime
  groping real estate, with consequences for women and men alike. In November
  of 2000, Mr. <b>Hideki
  Kato</b> was one such commuter on the Tonzei line, returning home from his
  human resources job on a train so round and fresh and firmly packed that barely
  five centimeters existed between himself and other passengers. At one point,
  according to police reports, a thirteen-year-old girl next to him started screaming.
  Kato was hauled off the train and placed in handcuffs.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">

    <td align="center" valign="middle"><img src="g_wide.jpg" width="740" height="300" vspace="5"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>According to Kato's "victim," she felt her someone flip up  her skirt so her
  "buttocks, thighs and genital areas could be touched". Kato argued his innocence:
  he's 184 centimeters tall, the girl is 162.5 centimeters tall. In train
  packed to 200% capacity, it would indeed be difficult (if not impossible) to
  maneuver one's elbows and grope the girl as she claimed, especially when he
  had a huge bag on his shoulder. Unfortunately, Kato languished
  in solitary confinement until
July of 2001. </p>
<p><img src="g_girls.jpg" width="400" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >After
  Kato was convicted of indecent assault, he became the first man ever in Japan
  to step forward and claim the charges were bogus. He formed a men's group
  called the <b><i>Network
  Of False Convictions Regarding Groping (NOFCR) </i></b>.
  If that sounds like an awesome name for your new band, consider also the <i><b>Society
  For The Prevention
  Of Antisocial Behavior In Railway Trains And Other Public Places (SFTPOABIRTAOPP),</b></i> who
  regularly hold conferences at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building after
  adopting a joint declaration on the <i><b>Eradication Of Molesters and Hidden
  Cameras (EOMAHC).</b></i>  Dude, my iPod screen is getting full. The premiere
  meeting of these teams was adjourned with a <b>loud
  group chant</b> in
  a show of solidarity against subway groping -- truly a super-terrific
happy fun good time serious bad hands hour. </p>
<p><img src="g_kato.jpg" width="150" height="193" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >In
  2003, Mr. Kato was released on bail and allowed to live at home. Not so lucky
  was the anonymous 40-year-old man who fled the JR Tennoni Station in 2004
  after a 20-year-old student accused him of groping her. He was tackled on the
  platform by four male passengers, one of whom was an off-duty police officer
  -- and he died later at the hospital. The Japanese groping "problem" has since
  spawned a miniature mafia of conniving young boys and girls who <b>blackmail</b>  or
  otherwise extort fearful subway riders. Innocent men are spontaneously (and
  falsely) accused by  girls -- and rather than risk jail in a system inclined
  to assume guilt, pay-offs in excess of $500-$1,000 are made to the "husbands
  and boyfriends" who
  lurk nearby.</p>
<p>So simply
  put, guys and gals: if you can't handle a little groping -- or being accused
  of groping -- the terrorists win. If you've got a big pouty problem with
  the necessary restrictions that go hand in hand with freedom, scrub off that
  whore paint, crawl back in that burka and stop watching television. The
  Bush administration <b>cannot be any clearer</b> on the issue. Increased security
  measures and mandatory grope checks aren't just for adult bookstores anymore:
  they can be found at bus terminals, ferry lines and airports across the United
  States </p>
<p><img src="g_airport.jpg" width="450" height="358" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >The <i>Seattle
    Post-Intelligence's</i> own Vanessa Ho (say it loud, squeeze
  it proud) related the tale of Lisa
  Lynch (rhymes with pinch), a 44-year-old doctoral student from Edmonds. She
  endured two such groping searches during a round trip to Denver Colorado, including
  one in which a female screener ran two fingers under each breast and a hand
  up the inside of both thighs. The incident reduced Ms. Lynch to a trembling
  pile of crybaby: "I couldn't work the next day. It was awful. What if I was
  a rape victim, or had a history of sexual abuse?"</p>
<p><i>What if?</i> Christ lady, yank down those pissy panties  and <b>let's make
  a deal,</b> you goddamn prima donna. And don't think we're letting another
  citizen, Caroline Snipes, off the hook either. She slipped off her high-wedged
  sandals and heavy-knit sweater at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport
  in 2004, according to the Ho report. Snipes actually had to stand with her
  feet and arms apart for <b>several moments</b> while an airport screener  --
  a total stranger -- touched her breasts! <img src="g_frisk.jpg" width="450" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >Good
  god almighty, is this an excerpt from <b>Stephen King's</b> <i>The Groping?</i> "She
  basically felt me up," the 25-year-old Snipes said of the anonymous agent. "I'm
  not a real squeamish person, but I just felt violated." Meanwhile, in a particularly
  hard-to-digest moment of perspective, Snipes herself was revealed to be 
  a law enforcement officer.</p>
<p>Jennifer Peppin, a spokesperson for the National Transportation Security Administration,
  has this to say about groping: "I think we understand the feelings of privacy
  and being uncomfortable. I think also our screeners understand that, and the
  process is certainly not one they necessarily enjoy."</p>
<p><b><img src="g_ladies.gif" width="150" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right">BZZZT.</b> Sorry,
  looks like Ms. Peppin tried to waltz through our <b>truth
    detectors</b> with
  a big fat exaggeration
  stuffed down her brassiere! Eight hours a day fondling breasts <i>not
  a job one can enjoy?</i> Soap up your tits and smoosh
  'em against the glass ceiling a little harder next time. Ever since public
  anxieties over the distress of the suffering of the consequences
  of the tragedy of the aftermath of <a href="/library/crime/terrorism/september_11/">9/11</a>, many
  so-called "interstate travelers" have complained openly about the new pat-down
  groping searches. What passengers seem to forget is that they're being given
  the once-over in pursuit of <b>illegal airplane contraband,</b> like explosives
  or cuticle trimmers. Security won't just pat you down if a metal detector
  goes off -- <img src="g_big.jpg" width="350" height="263" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left"> you'll be pulled from a line just for wearing something
  "bulky or baggy" which makes the contours of your body invisible
  or unclear to the human eye. 
Droopy, saggity-ass trousers which hang below
  your balls means you're a prime target for getting your knockers bonked plain
  and proper.</p>
<p>
What
  are the options for those among us who wish to fight back? In Green
  Bay, Wisconsin, a 62-year-old woman retaliated <b>tit for tat</b> against a
  female airport screener at the Outagamie County Regional Airport by grabbing <i>her</i> breasts
  and giving her a righteous shove. Phyllis Ditenfass, a retired technology school
teacher was taken to a screening area where supervisor Anita Gostisha (a three-year
  veteran) attempted to follow protocol with a screening wand and a limited pat-down
  search. She touched Ditenfass on the sides and back, but when the screener
  touched her precious 62-year-old boobs, Phyllis lashed out, according to court
  transcripts:<br>
  <br>
"She
  said <i><b>how would you like it if I did that to you,</b></i> and slammed
  me against the wall," Gostisha testified. "She came at me and grabbed
my breasts and squeezed them with firm pressure."</p>
<p>Federal prosecutor Tim Funnell argued that Phyllis punished Anita for doing
  her job. Phyllis, charged with assault of a federal employee, was found guilty
   and faced up to a year in federal prison and a fine of $100,000. These days,
  Phyllis leads workshops where individuals can learn how to make <i>beaded necklaces</i>  on
  spiral ropes. Without irony, Ms. Ditenfass -- like millions of unseen gropers
  across our wonderful world -- now refers to herself as a master beader. </p>
