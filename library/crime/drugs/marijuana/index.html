<h1>Marijuana</h1>

<img src="/library/crime/drugs/marijuana/bong.jpg" height="240" width="320" hspace="15" vspace="15" align=right>

Congratulations on the purchase of your brand new <a href="/library/culture/bongs/">bong</a>! Take that sticky bud, cram it into the bowl and smoke until you cough and see stars, whichever comes first. That's some good shit, man. <p>

Cost: $60-80 for 1/8 ounce, $300-$350 for 1 ounce. (As of the year 2000 in the Big City, anyway.) <p>

Nicknames: Dope, Mary Jane, Pot, Bud, The Green Guy, Weed, Grass, Reefer, Ganja, Stuff, Boo-ya, Chronic, Herb, THC, Indo, <a href="/library/culture/jerkcity/">HULAGHULAG</a>. <p>

Effects: You have your choice: bong, joint, pipe or baked into a delicious chocolate brownie. Getting high includes short-term memory loss, mild sensory distortions, dizziness and a general euphoric feeling associated with well-being and relaxation. Higher doses, in the form of daily bonghits, can lead to depersonalization, anxiety, hallucinations, delusions, and <a href="/library/conspiracy/">paranoia</a>. 

<p>
On the plus side, the intoxicating effects of the drug lead its users to giggle, eat junk food, form drum circles and watch children's television programming for hours on end. One very noticable effect is redness in the eyes. 
<p>

Getting Busted: Penalities can be stiff (years in <a href="/library/crime/prison/">prison</a>) or a slap on the wrist depending on which country, state or county you are in and how much you've got vacuum-packed in the trunk. 
<p>

Sure, you can make it into a rope, wear it as a shirt or feed it to starving nations, but wouldn't you rather be smoking it? 

The major psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is tetrahydrocannabinol otherwise known as THC. Over 400 other chemicals are found in marijuana, including tar and carcinogens. Modern man knows this much: You smokes it, you gets stoned. 'nuff said. 

<p>

Modern day pot culture is annoying and benign at the same time. Beyond the tacky clothing, college students snickering when the clock strikes 4:20 and the <a href="/library/culture/pink-floyd/">stoner music</a>, nobody likes hippies.

<p>
While the United States Government has bent over backwards to weed out this gift from Mother Nature, the drug is considered to be a mild stimulant, not a habit forming substance like <a href="/library/crime/drugs/overdose-deaths/">cocaine, alcohol or heroin</a>. Perhaps the popularity of marijuana has something to do with the never-ending disinformation campaigns designed to scare people into trying it for themselves. 

<p>

In 1996, California enacted Proposition 215, which legalized marijuana use for people suffering from <a href="/library/medicine/epidemics/aids/">AIDS</a>, cancer, and other serious illnesses. While the state has respected the voter's wishes, the Federal Government continues to raid medical marijuana farms and distributors. Surely this proves that marijuana is on the minds of the middle class: An estimated 24 million persons have used marijuana and approximately 3.4 million are current users.
<p>
<img src="/library/crime/drugs/marijuana/mc.gif" height="138" width="158" hspace="15" vspace="15" align=right>

Despite the embarassing dark age the United States is stuck in, sending record numbers of citizens to prison for possessing and distributing marijuana in the name of a War on Drugs, The Netherlands and <a href="/library/history/countries/canada/">Canada</a> have more relaxed laws when it comes to cannibis. Dutch cafes will sell marijuana openly, making various flavors and price ranges available to those over 18, much to the delight of Germans living near the border. Canada, much to America's embarassment, is flirting with legalization while the United Kingdom all but ignores users. 

<p>

"When I was in England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and I didn't like it. I didn't inhale, and never tried it again."
<br>
  -- <a href="/library/bio/presidents/bill-clinton/">Bill Clinton</a>, during his 1992 Presidential campaign
<p>

"I tell them I don't need drugs to get high or be cool:<br>
 I can do it with alcohol, my anti-drug."
<br>  -- The Onion<p>


Well, they'll stone ya when you're trying to be so good, <br>
They'll stone ya just a-like they said they would.<br>
They'll stone ya when you're tryin' to go home.<br>
Then they'll stone ya when you're there all alone.<br>
But I would not feel so all alone,<br>
Everybody must get stoned.
<br>
  -- Bob Dylan
