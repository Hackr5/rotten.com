<h1>Methamphetamine</h1>
<p><i>"Who wouldn't want to use it? You lose weight and you have great sex." --
    Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Laymon</i><br>
    <br>
  Hey kids. Crystal meth is created by cooking the <i>ephedrine</i> or pseudoephedrine
  found in cold medicines or weight loss aids. The pills are crushed into powder,
  then blended to a steady boil with other solvents like starter fluid or Coleman
  fuel. This creates a bubbly, sudsy chemical reaction which can be strained
  through one of your children's diapers and set aside to dry in the basement
  or living room.</p>
<p>The foaming white, crumbly residue can be smoked in a traditional, contemporary
  American crack pipe made from glass or ceramic [high in 3-5 minutes] -- or
  placed gently upon a small sheet of tinfoil, heated from below with a cigarette
  lighter and the vapors inhaled [high in 2-3 minutes]. If the end product looks
  more like crystals than powder, they can be melted over a spoon, sucked into
  a communal syringe, and injected into your bloodstream [immediately high].
  <img src="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/methChatRoom.gif" height="138" width="178" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10> If you just want
  to put it in your mouth and swallow, you have to wait fifteen minutes. A single
  dose of meth lasts for six to eight hours. The identical portion of cocaine
  would get you high for maybe twenty minutes.</p>
<img src="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/meth_user.jpg" height="302" width="338" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>Dr. Mary Holley, obstetrician and chairperson of Mothers Against Methamphetamine,
  informed the Associated Press that one's initial hit of meth is the equivalent
  of ten orgasms all on top of each other, each lasting for 30 minutes to an
  hour, with a feeling of arousal that lasts for another day and a half. She
  is quick to confess that the effect doesn't last long: "After you've been using
  [meth] about six months or so, you can't have sex unless you're high. After
  you have been using it a little bit longer you can't have sex even when you're
  high. Nothing happens. [Your penis] doesn't work."</p>
<p>And you're not obligated to keep referring to it as <i>methamphetamine, </i>Poindexter.
  Popular slang for this drug of course includes <i>crystal</i>, but more commonly <b>tina</b> --
  a corruption of the word <i>sixteen</i>, based on the concept of one sixteenth
  of an ounce. When you see Craigslist classified ads from people searching for
  a "party with Tina," you can rest assured they're willing to spend anywhere
  from three to five dollars.</p>
<img src="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/methgoogle.gif" height="84" width="209" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>
<h1>Meth Labs</h1>
<p> Eighty percent of meth comes from Mexican drug cartels operating in the desolate
  expanses of central and southern California. Enterprising individuals armed
  with orange rubber hoses stretched like octopus arms across gas torches heating
  Big Gulp cups of isopropyl alcohol can make about <i>280</i> doses per concoction
  -- provided there's enough cat litter to absorb stray toxins. With commercial-grade
  lab equipment, a single basement can churn out close to <b>a million units</b> every
  two days using high-thread-count Martha Stewart linens to filter solids from
  liquids. <i>The Oregonian</i> reports that California's Central Valley, according
  to Fresno prosecutor Carl M. Faller Jr, is "Columbia for meth".</p>
<img src="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/rocket.jpg" height="200" width="300" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>Might a <b>portable meth lab</b> in your car adequately pimp your ride? The <i>Narcotics
    Digest Weekly</i> tells of a federal grand jury in Kentucky who indicted
    two men for concealing ice methamphetamine in a motorized, 3-foot hobby rocket
    -- connected by wires to the vehicle's cigarette lighter. If stopped by police,
    the men planned to open the trunk of the vehicle, raise the methamphetamine-filled
    rocket into launching position using a string and pulley system, and launch
    the rocket into the air. These two men now host <i>Methbusters</i> on the
    Discovery channel.</p>
<p>Creating methamphetamine is a dangerous process. The chemicals and solvents
  are more than just flammable; they're highly volatile and downright explosive.
  If you're bubblin' up paint thinner in a $19.00 Family Guy coffee mug you ordered
  off a web site -- and it cracks in half over the <i>Spider-Man 2</i> laser
  pointer doubling as a Bunsen burner -- well, nobody ever said finding the perfect
  recipe was gonna be easy. <img src="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/methfire.jpg" height="281" width="180" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>
  It's not Julia Child in the kitchen, it's Julia Child on meth in the kitchen:
  and she's in there whackin' on turkeys with croquet mallets and makin' those
  weird meth faces, going <i>duh</i> with all her stupid meth friends, knocking
  the pie into the propane, and generally being careless. When meth ingredients
  explode and glass containers burst, hot sticky chemicals splash outward in
  every direction. Meth labs don't "catch" fire, they're instantly placed into
  a state of violent, raging fire climbing up the walls and ceiling of your trailer
  home or apartment complex. So <b>wear an apron. </b>Nothing beats a picture
  of a burned-out Volkswagen bus meth lab with an upside-down teddy bear in the
  corner.</p>
<p>Perhaps investing in better lab equipment becomes pointless when (a) it might
  blow up at any moment, and (b) the police can seize all of it at any time.
  Individuals busted for developing in-house meth labs now face the same scrutiny
  as captured sex offenders: in December of 2005, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation
  launched an Internet Registry of convicted methamphetamine manufacturers. </p>
<p>In North Carolina, crystal meth is considered a <b>weapon of mass destruction,</b> invoked
  in accordance with the Patriot Act under the state's Nuclear, Biological, and
  Chemical Weapons Act. Under the law, a meth conviction results in a sentence
  ranging from 12 years to life in prison on each count.
</p>

"The difference between a sex offender and someone involved in illegal narcotics
is that you can get out of the illegal narcotics business," claims Sergeant Jason
Grellner, commander of the meth unit in Franklin County, Montana. Mug shots and
photographs of the offenders will not be included in the online expose, primarily
because most rural sheriff's departments can't afford all that big-city digital
camera paraphernalia.</p>

<p>
<img src="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/methsmurf.jpg" height="210" width="300" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

One side effect of these new drug laws is the practice of "smurfing," a colloquialism
  so poorly coined it brings to mind only a handful of uptight squares or parents
  who don't understand. <i>Smurfing</i> is the act of considering every possible
  store in your area which might sell products with pseudoephedrine, driving
  to each store, and purchasing that store's two-package limit. The reason it's
  called <b>smurfing</b> is because large groups of meth addicts can be seen
  assembled together in this ritual, standing in a big conga line, clutching
  bottles of blue cough medicine. Plus if you squint your eyes and you're a totally
  uneducated huckleberry from Sticksville, Stupidland -- something about the
  whole deal reminds you of a bunch of Smurfs. Which makes the police Gargamel
  and the DEA Azreal. The word <i>smurfing</i> was originally a banking term
  which described the process of evading government scrutiny by breaking up one
  single mammoth financial transaction into many smaller ones. The term has been
  further corrupted to describe forging packets on a computer network to produce
  denial of service attacks.</p>
<h1>Q: What's a cat's favorite drug?<br>
  A: MEOWthamphetamine
</h1>
<p>In December of 2005, Linda Green, the widow of an Oklahoma State Trooper
killed by a violent meth addict, filed a wrongful-death suit against Pfizer,
Wal-Mart, Walgreen, Dollar General and United Supermarkets -- arguing the
companies knew they were supplying meth addicts with the tools of their trade.
The word <i>smurfing</i> does
    not appear once in the document. </p><img src="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/methmakeover.jpg" height="360" width="480" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>The War on Drugs is stronger now than it's ever been, and states like Oklahoma
  have already pioneered new laws banning certain types of cough syrup containing
  pseudo-ephedrine and other ingredients. The purpose of this legislation is
  to get pain relievers off the shelves where they might be bought in bulk. The
  bill passed easily in 2004, ushering in a new era of red-flagged sales, purchases
  tracked with fingerprints and photo IDs, and signature logs establishing direct
  paper trails capable of linking you and your stoner buddies to that basement
  treasure trove of Winnie the Pooh Sneezy-Head Flu gelatinous caps. Ephedrine
  all by itself, as an ingredient, can fetch $3,000 per pound on the street. </p>
<p>But law enforcement is essentially helpless: they can't possibly bust every
  single mobile and stationary lab in town. In Georgia, police chased the "Mailbox
  Meth Gang," a group of twenty talented addicts who kept an eye out for raised
  red flags on the mailboxes of their neighborhood's housing subdivisions. Such
  mailboxes were observed to contain checks, bank statements, credit card offers,
  and other forms of ID suitable for plundering. The Mailbox Meth Gang secured
  roughly 14,000 credit card numbers, which they used in the service of securing
  more meth. One defendant who pled guilty to fifty-six counts of identity theft
  received close to a full year in the county jail.</p>
<h1>Symptoms</h1>
<p>Dry mouth, one immediate side effect, is the result of depleted saliva glands,
  easily exacerbated by the acidic nature of the drug when smoked or snorted.
  Meth users often try medicating themselves with crazy, delicious liters of
  Mr. Pibb and Red Vines -- but syrupy, sugary candies and sodas only contribute
  to the decay. Meth cavities usually start <i>between</i> two teeth, trapezing
  from cuspid to cuspid across the network of enamel. The desire to grind one's
  molars together can easily result in multiple teeth snapping right out of your
  mouth and into the hot tub, or being left behind after a bite of your peanut
  butter sandwich. The meth mouth epidemic is widespread in prisons as well,
  where clean, sharp teeth are not always valued. Prisons are now obligated to
  devote a growing portion of their health-care budgets to emergency dental care,
  which costs taxpayers in every state a small fortune each year. Meth culture
  has emerged just in time to intersect with price reductions in false teeth
  and DaVinci Veneers. </p>
<img src="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/meth_mouth.jpg" height="252" width="389" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>The drug causes so much weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth that the
  phrase <b>meth mouth</b> has entered the public discourse. The heated substance,
  when fully aspirated, swirls through the users' teeth and gums, inevitably
  leading to sores which never heal. Tooth enamel wears away quickly as entire
  <a href="/library/crime/drugs/self-dentistry/">rows of teeth</a> dissolve to the gumline. It collects in the nasal passages which
  drain in the back of the throat, effectively corroding your entire face.</p>
<p>Regular meth users are referred to as tweakers, so-called because they can
  go <b>ALL TWEAKEND LONG, BABY.</b> They can be awake for three to fifteen days
  straight: irritable, violent and paranoid. On the show <i>Cops</i>, tweakers
  are frequently witnessed at the scene of automobile accidents and domestic
  disputes, freaked out with their shirts off and not at all surprised they're
  being filmed by <i>Cops</i>. Prairie View Prevention Services, Inc. in association
  with MAPP, the Meth Awareness and Prevention Project, have created a small
  instructional flyer on how to handle tweakers:</p>
<p>
    <b><i>If you notice that someone is tweaking, be careful how you handle the
    situation. Keep in mind these six safety tips for approaching a tweaker:</i></b></p>
<p><i> <b>1. Keep your distance. </b>Coming too close can be perceived as threatening. </i></p>
<p><i> <b>2. No bright lights.</b> The tweaker is paranoid and bright lights
    may cause them to react violently.</i></p>
<p><i> <b>3. Slow your speech,</b> lower your voice.</i></p>
<p><i> <b>4. Slow your movements.</b> The tweaker is paranoid and may misunderstand
    your movements.</i></p>
<p><i> <b>5. Keep your hands visible, </b>or they may feel threatened and become
    violent.</i></p>
<p><i> <b>6. Keep the tweaker talking. </b>A tweaker who falls silent can be
    extremely dangerous. Silence often means that his paranoid thoughts have
    taken over reality, and anyone present can become part of the tweaker's paranoid
    delusions.</i></p>

<h1>Gayness</h1>
<p><i>Meth</i> is the shortest word in the English language one can lisp while
  drunk and underage at a gay bar. It can therefore be no surprise that homosexual
  males have congregated around the substance since its inception. For every
  meth mouth, there is an equal and opposite <b>meth dick.</b> Just ask graphic
  designer and 27-year-old Chad Upham, who grew so concerned about how easily
  he could enjoy drug weekends and unprotected sexual encounters with same-sex
  partners found online that he printed up T-shirts bearing the slogan<b> I USE
  CRYSTAL METHAMPHETAMINE.</b></p>
<p>"A lot of people I've met [online] are just messes," Chad confessed to Will
  O'Bryan in the <i>D.C. MetroWeekly</i>. "Their entire lives revolve around this.
  There's nothing but Gatorade in the refrigerator and candy all over the house.
  I saw a guy freak out, just yelling on his bed."<br>
    <br>
  <img src="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/methpride.jpg" height="321" width="316" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10> <b><i>Rrrrrowr!</i></b> But
  have you ever tried <i>searching</i> for such a needle in a gaystack? Not cool.
  Methamphetamine even has its own gay rainbow flag, a byproduct of the the cooking
  and straining process which commonly contributes unique colors, hues, and saturations
  to the dose. To be sure, unscrupulous dealers sometimes add food coloring to
  their stash, either to disguise their amateur technique or to peddle their
  warez more effectively.</p>
<p><b>RED: </b>Meth was made from pseudo-ephedrine, and the red coloring of the original
  tablet was not adequately washed away.
</p>
<p>
    <b>ORANGE:</b> Ephedrine sulfate was used, and a portion of the sulfate was reduced
  to sulfur.</p>
<p>
    <b>PURPLE:</b> Iodine from a phosphorus-iodine reaction was not washed out.</p>
<p><b>GREEN:</b> Copper or other metallic salts made their way in to the mixture,
  probably due to the reaction vessel.</p>
    <p><b>BROWN:</b> Oxidized red coloring or tablating agent was present in the reduction.</p>
<img src="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/raptor2.jpg" height="242" width="150" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>Doctors and health advocates alike have come to demonize the drug, insisting
  that meth is systematically hunting down and exterminating the gay community
  from the inside out, just like that dinosaur in <i>Jurassic Park</i> who stalks
  and kills the one guy who looks like a cross between Gene Wilder and French
  Stewart. Consider the delicious warnings from Grant Colfax, a leading researcher
  with the San Francisco Department of Public Health:</p>
<p>"It makes them feel sexy," Colfax reports. "They feel that it enhances their
  sexual behavior. Meth enhances the release of neurotransmitters -- especially
  dopamine -- and this release is associated with increased energy, increased
  libido, and increased feelings of invulnerability."<br>
    <br>
  Sage advice and brilliant wordsmithing indeed, although he could have just
  said <b> if you want more dope, switch to meth. </b>Furthermore, it's unclear
  if Colfax was referring to gay sex among adult males or velociraptors. Statistically
  speaking, gay men, with their patterns of heavy alcohol use and incessant where's-the-hood-at
  party mentality are far more likely in any city, suburb, or backwoods farmhouse
  (let's all say it together) to bend over willingly and take crank for hours.
  Meanwhile, health campaigns targeting the lesbian and gay community have only
  begun searching for the right words and pictures to deliver anti-meth messages,
  often referred to internally as <i>anti-methages.<br>
  </i><br>
  <img src="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/meth-hiv.jpg" height="295" width="210" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10> <b>PARTY 'N' PLAY...
  OR PARTY 'N' <i>PAY??</i></b> spurts one mammoth 8 x 11" placard positioned
  directly over the center-stage urinal at <i>TUGS</i>, an uptown gay bar in
  <a href="/library/travel/cities/seattle/">Seattle's</a> famed Pike-Pine Corridor. Let us guess: it's a matter of life and
  meth? Another anti-crystal print and outdoor ad kicked off during Gay Pride
  in Canada, resulting in the wrath of Philip Morris' Marlboro brand but paving
  the way for mushy, meth-mouth movie magic like <i>Brokeback Mountain.</i> </p>
<p>Or maybe you just need a <i>booty bump,</i> a method of administering meth
  by mixing it with water, putting the liquid in a syringe with the needle broken
  off, sticking it up your ass and injecting it. Don Baird, former meth enthusiast,
  describes booty bumping as "an unusually high-maintenance spectacle which screams
  LOOK AT ME I'M PUTTING DRUGS UP MY ASS". It's no exaggeration to say the act
  casts an awkward shadow over the traditional greet-n-snort or ritualistic <a href="/library/sex/dildos/">passing of the pipe</a>.<br>
    <br>
  So whether you're a spazzed-out <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/music/clay-aiken/">circuit queen</a> or a skinhead. Whether you call
  it crank, chalk, <a href="/library/crime/blood-diamonds/">glass</a>, ice, trash, tina, amp, laundry detergent, altoids,
  nazi dope, white house or just plain crystal, <b>know the facts before making
  a meth out of your life.</b></p></p>
