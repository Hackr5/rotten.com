<h1>Road Rage </h1>

<p>According to the Department of Transportation, <b>road rage</b>  takes place
  when  "an
  angry or impatient motorist intentionally injures or kills another motorist,
  passenger, or pedestrian -- or attempts or threatens to injure or kill another
  motorist, passenger or pedestrian". It can be likened to any other traffic-related
  incident by its willful and criminal nature. Nearly 2,000 individuals suffer
  injuries from raging motorists each year. Nobody knows how many <i>hundreds</i> of
  thousands of motorists just get <a href="/library/language/the-finger/">the finger</a>. </p>
<p>In 1997 Dr. Leon James, Professor of Traffic Psychology
  at the University of Hawaii, offered congressional testimony about the subject
  during a Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Infrastructure.
  He noted that road rage has deeply human psychological roots, ranging from
  the innate, subconscious tendency toward <b>territorialism</b> which lives
  inside us all -- to our individually
  accumulated perceptions of the world we live in today. Children inherit <img src="rr_club.jpg" width="230" height="181" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" > aggressive
  and dangerous driving patterns not only from their parents and friends, but
  by absorbing behaviors depicted in movies and video games.</p>
<p>Ask any cab driver who the most annoying motorists on the road are, and it's
  likely he'll say "other cab drivers". Road ragers typically exchange
  little more than a vindictive turn of phrase or an inappropriate gesture,
  but road rage cases remain exciting to news bureaus because
  of their ability to showcase raw human emotions <b>finally being tapped.</b> Police
  reports around the world are filled with perpetrators who have figured out
  how to communicate their many frustrations with award-winning creativity and
  innovation.</p>
<p>Road rage presents crime enthusiasts with plenty of girl-on-girl action. Woman
  driver Gena Foster of <img src="rr_rice.jpg" width="288" height="219" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Alabama died of a gunshot wound to the face after getting
  out of her car to confront the woman driver behind her. "She spit on me and
  I killed her," Shirley Henson quipped to the jury. "I always follow too closely."</p>
<p>In
  Rollinsford, New Hampshire, a female motorist irked by slow-moving traffic
  exited her van, attacked a construction worker and dragged her to the ground,
  repeatedly slapping her face with a sign labeled <b>Caution: Construction Ahead.</b></p>
<p>Departments
  of Transportation in nearly every state confess that road crews are frequent
  victims of road rage -- cursed at, spat upon, threatened with guns -- because
  they're stationary, unprotected human targets standing in the open air with
  nowhere to run. Between 2000 and 2001, when California entered one of the 
  hottest summers on record and <a href="/library/crime/corporate/enron/">Enron</a> was jacking up the price of electricity,
  it was not uncommon for a daily police blotter to cite an angry motorist who
  jumped from his car to attack a meter reader or utility crew, sometimes by
  pelting them with eggs or rocks.</p>
<p>The most popular method of engaging rage is to "flip off" your fellow motorists.
  Make sure you don't accidentally share your flipped bird with an off-duty
  cop, like citizen Daniel Shane did in November of 2000. <img src="rr_joe.jpg" width="411" height="334" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >When
  both vehicles screeched to a halt and the participants in the dispute climbed
  out to ascertain how best they could each "bring it on," officer Dwight Ray's
  response was to hose mace in Shane's eyes, and spray a few more squirts
  in the face of Shane's 5-year-old son as well. Officer Ray was suspended
  for three weeks. </p>
<p>The American Automobile Association has isolated four specific character
  traits which plague today's road ragers. Individuals easily predisposed to <b>anger</b> constitute
  the most obvious segment of the population. Anger is a momentary flare-up which
  quickly dies down, but a rapid sequence of hard spikes on one's emotional chart,
  when left untreated, can lead to perpetual righteous indignation. These drivers
   get angry at other drivers, whether they move too fast, or move too slow,
  or occupy what the road rager considers to be "the wrong lane". Everyday
  traffic occurrences which are part and parcel of standard merging procedure
  can take on a vicious, screaming life of their own.</p>
<p>Road ragers are quick to
  personalize a common affront: you cut them off, forcing them to slam on their
  brakes. The anger is further compounded when a road rager is acutely aware
  his brakes haven't been serviced recently; he knows that every unnecessary
  application of his foot on the pedal leads him closer to the repair shop. And
  do you really have to merge so <i>slowly?</i> Grow
  a cock and balls, you goddamn jizz bucket. If it's not man versus man, or
  man versus woman, it's man versus society: <i>everyone</i> is moving too slowly.
  The multi-lane highway is beginning to narrow, and motorists in front of
  you are still half-riding the shoulder. Pick a lane and stick with it, you
  stupid Ching Ping Chinaman. Even the passengers in your own car become a reliable
  source of anger: nothing makes a road rager more pissed off than being told
  by a spouse or co-worker to just calm
  down.</p>
<p> <b><img src="rr_dude.jpg" width="376" height="280" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Impatience</b> is
  the second weightiest matter, and these feelings can be triggered before the
  car is even in motion. Anticipation of the same monotonous jam during morning
  traffic manifests itself as a notable tension in the road rager's neck and
  shoulders. He's impatient for his passengers to kiss their stupid wives goodbye
  and <i>get into the goddamn car,</i> annoyed that he's
  been put in charge of a car pool. He can already anticipate how bloody fuckin'
  awful it's going to be driving his co-workers back home in reverse order, eight
  or nine hours from now. Road ragers regularly perceive themselves to
  be so "behind schedule" that the exhausting length of time it takes for the
  car engine to warm up is often enough to trigger a burst of adrenaline. The
  never-ending stream of stop signs at four-way intersections, at which fellow
  motorists suddenly forget the right-goes-first rule. The blinking stoplights
  which have <i>clearly</i> been
  broken for months, which fail to let an adequate number of cars go through 
  per cycle, are worthy of being ignored and summarily run straight through.
  The perpetual impatience and frustration associated with locating an adequate
  (and free) parking space is a constant irritant of road ragers, as is watching
  slow-moving pedestrians as they push their shopping carts and
  wheelchairs in front of them at the crosswalk.</p>
<p><img src="rr_red.jpg" width="340" height="255" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >Another
  studied character trait among road ragers is their predisposition toward <b>competition.</b> The
  road becomes a speeding courseway for gaming, in which the act of jockeying
  for a better position is paramount to achieving an arbitrarily assigned goal.
  A sense of one-upsmanship can start as simply as a personal bet with oneself,
  such as when a road rager decides he's going to beat the clock, or best his
  previous efforts. <i>This
time I'll make it to Palo Alto by 8:25.</i> Other vehicles on the
road are turned into <a href="/library/culture/chess/">chess</a> pieces -- plodding, retarded pawns to maneuver around
and ultimately remove as obstacles. Lane changes are made quickly and with greater
attempts at precision. Speed combined with a thumping movie soundtrack makes
the competitive road rager grow increasingly
deluded that he's actually a trained Hollywood stunt driver on a closed course. <i>Get
around the blue car. Then zip behind the red truck into lane four. </i>Pointless,
split-second gambles are made on which lane in front of him will open
up the fastest -- even when there's a tollbooth ahead. It is, after all, important
to idle in the fastest-moving queue. Competitive motorists genuinely believe
they're excellent drivers. They're  typically between the ages of 17 and 27,
often <i>Grand
Theft Auto</i> enthusiasts,
  military personnel, or off-duty law enforcement officers who for one reason
or another feel perfectly entitled to dominate the freeway. Their masculine
hard-top F<img src="rr_tacos.jpg" width="420" height="305" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >ord
Mustangs, muscle hot-rod Honda Civics with ridiculous wing-tipped spoilers, and
loud shitty music blasting from eighteen speakers often signal a competitive
road rager from miles away.</p>
<p>The fourth-most analyzed personality trait in a troublesome motorist is also
  the most recognizable. It's the desire one has to meter out  <b>revenge</b>  --
  in all its  subtle and classic forms -- to other drivers. The need to exact
  punishment for a perceived injustice, however slight, is a straightforward
  human quality which extends way beyond the world of the automobile. Even failing
  to acknowledge an slight act of courtesy can be grounds for a fight. You let
  someone in, and then they don't wave. The impulse to retaliate is the often
  result of feeling injured or invaded on the road, and can lead to further instances
  of rage ranging from repetitive horn honks, screaming at other drivers, or
  employing a well-extended middle finger.</p>
<p>More and more states in our blessed union are passing <i>Aggressive Driving</i> legislation,
  much of which is comprised of language so abstract you might think it was part
  of the Patriot Act. In New York, you can receive a traffic citation for "changing
  lanes or speed in a manner which serves no legitimate purpose". In Nebraska,
  you can get pulled over for "honking the horn repeatedly".
  In Maryland, drivers who deliberately drive "in a discourteous manner" are
  also subject to the same summary action. </p>
<p><img src="rr_oj.jpg" width="352" height="272" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left">Less than a decade  after <a href="/library/bio/sports/o-j-simpson/">O.J. Simpson</a> was found not demonstrably guilty of
  committing the twentieth century's most famous double homicide, he found himself
  facing 16 years in prison for a particularly disturbing bit of road rage in
  Miami, Florida. On December 4, 2000, 55-year-old Jeffery Pattinson reportedly
  slammed on his brakes to avoid a black SUV running a stop sign. Annoyed, he
  honked his horn repeatedly, then flashed his lights. The SUV screeched to a
  halt, forcing Pattinson to do the same. </p>
<p>According to the police report, Pattinson saw a black man emerge from the
  SUV and approach his car shouting, "So I blew the stop sign! What are
you going to do, kill me and my kids?"</p>
<p><img src="rr_duh.jpg" width="252" height="201" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Pattinson, still buckled in his driver's seat, replied, "What the hell
  is the matter with you?" -- and then instantly recognized Simpson. Pattinson
  claims O.J. was "reached through the partially-opened window and grabbed a
   $300 pair sunglasses right off his face -- scratching his temple in the process.
  At the same time, Pattinson says he heard a girl's voice screaming from Simpson's
  vehicle: "No,
  Daddy, no Daddy, no!"</p>
<p>Pattinson says he grabbed his glasses back from Simpson,
  who then turned around, returned to his car and sped off. The victim  went
  straight home, picked up the phone and called police to report the run-in.
  Cops began an investigation, starting with dusting the sunglasses for O.J.'s
  fingerprints,  ostensibly hoping for more of that elusive Simpson <a href="/library/medicine/dna/">DNA</a>. Simpson
  was  charged with assault, burglary of a car, and battery. <i>CourtTV</i> quickly
  seized upon the opportunity to construct a clip-art montage containing O.J.
  Simpson, some kind of SUV, and a pair of disposable sunglasses like the kind
  you'd buy at a gas station mini-mart in the middle of nowhere. </p>
<p><img src="rr_frogs.jpg" width="381" height="138" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >During
  the trial, O.J. insisted the incident was actually quite the reverse, contradicting
  nearly all of Pattinson's testimony. "The guy got behind
  me and he started beeping his horn and he sat on his horn," Simpson recalled
  during direct examination. "It was just
  one constant blare of the horn. I got out of my car. I said, 'You can't
  do this. I got a couple kids in this car. You can't do it.' At that he blew
  up. He puffed up like a <b>bull frog</b> and went off." A jury deliberated
  for less than two hours before pronouncing Orenthal James Simpson not guilty. </p>
<p><img src="rr_leo.jpg" width="276" height="310" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >All
  it takes for a road rage story to incite worldwide panic is a little animal
  abuse. One of the most infamous road rage cases in recent American
  history went down in February of 2001, near the San Jose Airport in California.
  Sara McBurnett was driving with her ten-year-old dog named Leo, a
  <i>bichon frise</i> of the same breed which won Best In Show at the
  Westminster canine
  competition that very year. In bumper-to-bumper traffic, she accidentally tapped
  the rear fender of the vehicle directly in front of her, a jet-black SUV with
  tinted windows and Virginia plates, driven by 27-year-old road rager Andrew
  Burnett. Both cars came to a stop, and Andrew exited his car.</p>
<p>When little Leo jumped up on Sara's lap to greet the man, Andrew reached through
  Sara's window and grabbed him by the collar. Then he hurled the dog end over
  end into the freeway, where it was
   promptly run over by an oncoming traffic. Panicked, Sara exited her car to
  retrieve Leo -- but the dog died on the way to the vet.</p>
<p>Andrew,
  meanwhile, ran back to his car and escaped out into traffic, fleeing the scene.
  Sara was left with only a minor description of the suspect -- and no license
  plate. The investigation faltered after Sara failed to pick Burnett out
  of two separate photo lineups. When the Humane Society offered a reward of
  $115,000 for information leading to Burnett's arrest, they were inundated with
  hundreds of tips for months. <img src="rr_andrew.jpg" width="191" height="280" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >Ultimately an anonymous e-mail led police in the
  right direction.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the <b>sixteen month</b> trial, observers in the courtroom
  burst into spontaneous applause when Burnett was given the maximum sentence
  --
  three years in prison.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry for what happened," he said. "If there's
anything I could ever say or do to bring Leo back, I would." </p>
<p>Burnett also served time in jail on charges connected
  to a stolen van belonging to Pacific Bell -- his employer at the time -- containing
   $68,000 worth of equipment. The reward money was split among John Mora ($75,000)
  a witness to the accident, and four others who each received $10,000. </p>
<p>"Words can never convey the depth of love I had for my dog Leo," Sara
  testified. "His clear intent was to terrorize me in the fastest
and clearest way he could under the circumstances."</p>
