"Hightower broke into a home, stole a gallon of milk and ran in front of the school bus, said Lt. Tom Foglia, a Homestead police spokesman. Hightower, whom police believe was under the influence of drugs, smashed a side window on the bus door to get inside. He then placed the female driver in a choke hold and forced her to take him to a hospital." Don't blame the drugs. That's unfair to the drugs. If you just have to blame something, blame the nudity.

"The Baghdad bunker which the United States said it bombed on the opening night of the Iraq war in a bid to kill <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam Hussein</a> never existed, CBS Evening News reported on Wednesday. The network quoted a US Army colonel in charge of inspecting key sites in Baghdad as saying no trace of a bunker or of bodies had been found at the site on the southern outskirts of the Iraqi capital, known as Dora Farms. 'When we came out here, the primary thing they were looking for was an underground facility, or bodies, forensics, and basically, what they saw was giant holes created. No underground facilities, no bodies.' ... Shortly after the attack, US Defence Secretary <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/donald-rumsfeld/">Donald Rumsfeld</a> told reporters: 'There's no question but that the strike on that leadership headquarters was successful. We have photographs of what took place. The question is, what was in there?'" Actually, Rummy, the question is: who concocted this bullshit?

"The United States Supreme Court has narrowed the historic right against self-incrimination, ruling that police and government investigators can force people to talk, as long as those admissions are not used to prosecute them. Tuesday's 6-3 opinion undercuts the well-known 'Miranda warnings', in which officers tell suspects of their right to remain silent. It appears to allow more aggressive police questioning of witnesses in the hope of obtaining evidence. While witnesses' words cannot be used against them in court, evidence can be. ... Similarly, unwilling witnesses called before investigating committees had the right to "plead the Fifth Amendment" and thereafter refuse to testify. But in Tuesday's opinion, the court majority said the Fifth Amendment came into play only when a suspect was tried in court."

"An Ottawa woman is demanding filters be placed on all computers in the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board, after her eight-year-old daughter came home from school and told her she'd watched www.sex.com on a grades 2 and 3 classroom computer. What Tracey Feldman's daughter said she'd seen was 'a person sucking another person's private.' ... 'I have no problems explaining where babies come from,' Ms. Feldman told the Citizen yesterday, 'but I wasn't quite prepared to deal with oral sex.'"

"A Nebraska lawmaker is so fed up with constituents crossing the state border to gamble that she proposed going to war with neighboring Iowa. 'I've been cautioned that the members of the Iowa Legislature might not take it kindly,' said Sen. Pam Brown of Omaha. Brown's proposed amendment read: 'The sovereign state of Nebraska declares a state of hostility with the sovereign state of Iowa until such a time as the state of Iowa ceases the unjust and relentless appropriation of the resources of the citizens of Nebraska.'"

"The Church of Scientology has sent out promotional brochures to national retailers such as the Gap and Banana Republic in an effort to lure more upscale businesses downtown. But city officials, largely caught off-guard, expressed surprise and disappointment at the strategy. ... Given the church's dominant presence downtown, there are people who refuse to spend money there because they think it would benefit Scientology, according to [one official]. 'If it looks to the public like the Church of Scientology is building downtown, people won't come.'"

"The grandmother of a 10-year-old blind girl from Oakdale, Minn., wrote Carey on her official Web site with a special request, since Carey recently canceled a concert at St. Paul's Xcel Energy Center. Hofland wrote to Carey, 'I know it is not very probable but you have no idea what it would mean to this child if she could meet Mariah even for 5 minutes. You would make one girl's dreams come true.' KMSP reprinted the response on its Web site: 'Miss with all due respect, I have my own problems. I have no time to accommodate everyone else's. My sister is suffering HIV right now. Is anyone worried about my problems? Some people can be so damn selfish. Next time you email me with any requests, you will be reported. Have a great day! m.c.'" <i>You will be reported?</i>

The proposals failed to sway many shareholders, who rejected the renewable energy measure with 79 percent opposed, compared with 80 percent opposed a year ago. ... Another measure calling on the oil giant to state it was against discrimination based on sexual orientation, was voted down with 73 percent opposed, down from 76 percent a year ago."

Andrew Liersch, 67, will appear in federal court Friday to face charges of money-laundering and wire fraud, which prosecutors and Goodwill officials say cost the charity $26 million. ... He was arrested Friday at Los Angeles International Airport after arriving from Guatemala where officials there expelled him when U.S. authorities alerted them that he had been indicted by a grand jury."
