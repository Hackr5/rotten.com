"Three people linked to white supremacist and anti-government groups are in custody. At least one <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/wmd/">weapon of mass destruction</a> - a sodium cyanide bomb capable of delivering a deadly gas cloud - has been seized in the Tyler area. Investigators have seized at least 100 other bombs, bomb components, machine guns, 500,000 rounds of ammunition and chemical agents. But the government also found some chilling personal documents indicating that unknown co-conspirators may still be free to carry out what appeared to be an advanced plot. And, authorities familiar with the case say more potentially deadly cyanide bombs may be in circulation."

"Iraqi scientists never revived their long-dead nuclear bomb program, and in fact lied to <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam Hussein</a> about how much progress they were making before U.S.-led attacks shut the operation down for good in 1991, Iraqi physicists say. Before that first <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/gulf-war/">Gulf War</a>, the chief of the weapons program resorted to 'blatant exaggeration' in telling Iraq's president how much bomb material was being produced... Seven months after a U.S.-British invasion toppled Saddam's Baath Party government, Iraqi scientists have grown more vocal in countering <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> administration claims that Baghdad had 'reconstituted' nuclear weapons development... Months of searching by hundreds of U.S. experts have found no trace of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/wmd/saddam/">nuclear, chemical or biological weapons in Iraq</a>, just as U.N. inspectors found none before the war. No Iraqi scientists have confirmed the programs were revived in recent years."

'It's disgusting, heartbreaking what they've done,' said Mary Koenig, whose husband, Gerry Koenig of Staten Island's Rescue 5 squad, ditched her and their two kids for Madeline Bergin, the widow of his friend and firehouse mate, John Bergin, after the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/wtc/">World Trade Center</a> attacks. An insider who has worked with firefighter families and a counselor who worked for one of the FDNY services told <i>The Post</i> there are about a dozen cases similar to the Koenigs."

The couple was riding home on a motorcyle when they were confronted by a 'bike gang' at 10.30pm on Friday.  They were forced to go to a nearby forest and told to have sexual intercourse in front of the group. When the boyfriend refused, the youths beat him up with their helmets and fists and dragged the Form Five schoolgirl to some nearby bushes where they took turns making her perform oral sex... Police have classified the case as committing carnal intercourse against the order of nature without consent under Section 377C of the Penal Code which carries a jail term of up to 20 years with possible whipping upon conviction."

"Bernalillo County Sheriff Darren White said this morning he was amazed at how easily thieves seemed to have pilfered 350 pounds of high explosives stored west of Albuquerque. 'I'm no expert in this field, but when I learned about it I was somewhat shocked that this material was only protected by a padlock,' White said. 'It does make you think how many more of these explosive magazines are around the country in the same situation.' The sacks of ammonium nitrate saturated with fuel oil - an explosive used in the April 1995 bombing of the Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City - had been missing for some time, possibly several days, before Titan Explosives discovered the theft and reported it Tuesday, White said... 'It appears to me that it was completely legal but in this post-9-11 era when we're spending billions on homeland security (and) we have this material virtually unprotected, it's almost bizarre.'"

Police said Crouch had driven his 1991 Chevrolet Cavalier to a dirt road in east Tampa on Sunday and allowed his son to ride on the rear bumper. Crouch intentionally drove the car forward and then in reverse several times in an attempt to throw the boy from the bumper, police said. The boy was thrown from the car and Crouch backed over him.

"Michael Braithwaite says money woes are forcing him to switch from turkey to chicken this Thanksgiving, a year after a religious awakening prompted him to switch his porn shop to a Christian bookstore. Business has been slow from the day Braithwaite decided to burn his $10,000 inventory of vibrators, leather goods, books and other porn paraphernalia, and restock the shelves with Bibles and Christian materials. 'The problem is that some of the Christians are still waiting to see if my walk with the Lord is real or not,' he said Wednesday, yet another slow day at Mike's Place (formerly known as Love World)."

"Leaning back on the opulent sofa, Ozzy's voice drops to almost a whisper as he admits: 'I was sexually abused when I was a kid... Two boys used to wait for me to come home after school. Then they would fuck around with me. They didn't fuck me but they messed around with me. They would force me to drop my pants and all that shit. They felt me and touched me and... it was terrible. The first time it happened was in front of my sister and that affected me even more. It became a regular thing on the way home from school. It seemed to go on forever.'"
