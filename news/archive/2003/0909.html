"A distraught passenger on board a Chinese plane en route to Beijing from Paris tried to commit hara-kiri with a pair of scissors, but was stopped at the last minute, state media reported on Friday. A stewardess on board the Air China flight was alerted to the situation when she noticed that the passenger, seated at the back of economy class, tried to slice his stomach open with the scissors, the <i>Beijing Today</i> newspaper said. Four crew members tried to subdue the passenger, while he attempted to smash his head into the wall, but a doctor on board finally managed to force a tranquilizer down his throat."

"Brianna LaHara said she was frightened to learn she was among the hundreds of people sued yesterday by giant music companies in federal courts around the country. 'I got really scared. My stomach is all turning,' Brianna said last night at the city Housing Authority apartment where she lives with her mom and her 9-year-old brother. 'I thought it was OK to download music because my mom paid a service fee for it. Out of all people, why did they pick me?'"

"A disabled woman has had to sleep in her wheelchair for a year because her local health trust would not allow staff to lift her into bed, a court has heard. Lorraine Wolstenholme, 50, of Monkston, Milton Keynes, has multiple sclerosis and is unable to get in or out of bed by herself. ... nurses who had been helping her out of bed were banned from doing so by Milton Keynes Primary Care Trust in June last year because of the perceived dangers of lifting her, though she weighs only eight-and-a-half stone. Mrs Wolstenholme has pressure sores on her body from sleeping awkwardly in the wheelchair."

"The note contained all the markings of a hate threat. There were two <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/racism/kkk/">KKK</a>'s scribbled, a hangman picture, eight likenesses of swastikas, four mentions of the so-called 'n-word' and a threat that <i>'I will hang you black nigger, get out of Hudson or die.'</i> ... The guilty party was, they say, a black Hudson freshman. ... 'I don't believe it,' said the 17-year-old junior who first contacted administrators and Rouson about the notes. ... The 17-year-old and his mother both said they believe the freshman was pressured into confessing. ... 'I don't believe it,' the mother of the threatened junior said. 'I've got the gut feeling the young man was pushed in a corner. Why would another black student -- with all we've gone through -- write a letter like that?'"

"In the world of accident reconstruction and safety analysis, the automobile 'black box,' a small silver-colored device located under seats or in the center console, has emerged in recent years as a valued technical resource, albeit one with limitations. ... Plugging into the system in GM cars from the 1994 model year forward will reward an investigator with concise charts and graphs that show speed, brake activation, throttle use, changes in velocity and seat belt use in the five seconds before a crash. Beginning with the 2001 model year, Ford cars with the technology offer more limited information about the crash."

"Yesterday, with cloth and cleaner to hand, his girlfriend, Manon von Gerkan, was hoisted up 40ft for a brief reunion with the illusionist -- albeit separated by perspex -- to wipe away the yolks that have impaired his view of the river Thames. ... 'I find it quite bizarre that people here have felt it necessary to throw eggs and other things at David,' she said, peeved. 'We never had anything like this in New York -- the worst we got was the odd fuck off. I must say I find these kind of people really strange.' The reaction of Britons to Blaine's widely self-publicised feat of survival and mind control has also included a volley of golf balls."

A search of the car revealed three 'cookies,' or large discs of crack, which would have been broken into smaller rocks for sale...

"An 8-year-old boy reported missing by his mother had been sleeping in a pile of trash in their home, police said. The woman was charged with child neglect. ... At 9 a.m., he emerged, well-rested, from his mother's bedroom. The boy showed police where he had been asleep, walking over stacks of trash to a corner of the bedroom where he had curled up under a pile of clothing and other debris. 'It's amazing -- the interior of this house was so cluttered and dirty that we couldn't find him in it,' Tampa police spokesman Joe Durkin said. The four-bedroom, 1,300-square-foot concrete block home had urine-stained floors and was covered with mounds of garbage, clothing, debris and cat feces, police said."
