<b>Viewership</b><br>
On the first full day this page went live, 100,000 people visited this Rotten
News page. Of course that was the day after the WTC attacks, so that number is
somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"Baby Jordan had his tiny toes crushed one by one, was hit so hard his bottom teeth went through the roof of his mouth, and was subjected to repeated punches to the stomach. The seven-month-old's torture and suffering ended only when he choked to death on his own vomit. Yesterday the man responsible for the brutal killing of the baby boy was sentenced to a minimum term of just eight years and three months. With time already served, Christopher Hoerler could be free in January 2010, at the age of 32... nobody heard Jordan scream during the attack because it was believed the first punch to his jaw, which drove his bottom teeth into the roof of his mouth, knocked him unconscious. His extensive facial injuries and fractured ribs suggested he had been dragged face down over carpet or a sofa and punched hard in the abdomen. Hoerler then set about crushing Jordan's little toes - one by one - with a fan clamp."

"18-year-old Eugene Weston Junior and his cousin planned to drown their pit bull in an old abandoned cotton gin across the street from their home. The gin hadn't been used in more than 30 years and inside the pit was a thick combination of water, oil, diesel fuel, hydraulic fluid, and dirt. As the son looked into the eight to ten foot pit, he slipped and fell in. The cousin ran for help and called 9-1-1. That's when the father, 42-year-old Eugene Weston Senior, jumped into the pit after his son... The pit bull is still alive and unharmed."

"While expressing regret over the incident, the Secret Service also stopped short of offering the apology that the waiter, Mohamad I. Pharoan, 58, has sought. He had expected to help serve lunch to 550 people at a banquet at which President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> raised $1 million for his reelection campaign. Instead, he says, he was given a few minutes to change clothes and was escorted off the premises after a manager asked him one question: 'Is your name Mohamad?' Last week, the Secret Service denied that it had requested the hotel's management to dismiss Pharoan for the day. But a spokesman said yesterday that after further review, the Secret Service found it was responsible."

"The Associated Press conducted a major investigation of Iraq's wartime civilian casualties, documenting the deaths of 3,240 civilians between March 20 and April 20. That investigation, conducted in May and June, surveyed about half of Iraq's hospitals and reported that the real number of civilian deaths was sure to be much higher. The Health Ministry's count, which was to be based on the records of all Iraq's hospitals, promised to be more complete. The ministry began its survey at the end of July, when shaky nationwide communication links began to improve. It sent letters to all hospitals and clinics in Iraq, asking them to send back details of civilians killed or wounded in the war, ministry officials said then. Many hospitals responded, [Dr. Nagham Mohsen] said, but last month, Shabandar told her that [Iraqi health minister Dr. Khodeir Abbas] wanted the count halted. He also told her not to release the information she already had collected, she said."

So proud that he snapped photos of Her Worship wearing the chain of office - and nothing else. Everything was fine until photos of a smiling Ms. Smith were allegedly copied from her home computer during a house party her kids threw, then circulated around the mill town of 4,300... 'My privacy has been violated in every sense,' Ms. Smith wrote in her letter earlier this month to <i>Houston Today</i>. 'These photos are private property belonging to my husband and me. I am very hurt and embarrassed.'"

"Beginning 8,000 years ago, atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide began to rise as humans started clearing forests, planting crops and raising livestock, a scientist said Tuesday. Methane levels started increasing 3,000 years later... Previously, scientists widely assumed it was only with the onset of the factory age that human activity had any significant effect on the global climate. The prehistoric changes in carbon dioxide and methane levels have been noted before but were attributed to natural causes, Ruddiman said."
