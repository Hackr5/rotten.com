Nugent said Illinois residents fail to reach out to their elected officials. 'I get to feel the pulse of working-hard, playing-hard America,' Nugent said. 'And right now one of the most embarrassing, and I believe grossly irresponsible regions of apathy, is right now listening in Illinois. Illinois people have become so sheeplike.

His poor, mostly minority high school of 1,650 students had a freshman class of 1,000 that dwindled to fewer than 300 students by senior year. And yet -- and this is the miracle -- not one dropout to report! ... Westside High here had 2,308 students and no reported dropouts; Wheatley High 731 students, no dropouts. ... KHOU broke the news that Sharpstown High had falsified its dropout data. That led to a state audit of 16 Houston schools, which found that of 5,500 teenagers surveyed who had left school, 3,000 should have been counted as dropouts but were not. Last week, the state appointed a monitor to oversee the district's data collection and downgraded 14 audited schools to the state's lowest rating."

Colsaun Bailey, the 17-year-old alleged owner of the gun, was arrested, though police said they did not believe he fired the weapon, <i>The Journal News</i> reported Wednesday. 'We are operating on the assumption that nobody picked up the gun and fired it,' police Capt. John McCoy told the newspaper. Police said Bailey put two handguns in a bag then placed it inside the oven, which someone later turned on. When the woman opened the oven door to see why smoke was coming from it, one of the guns discharged, striking her, police said."

Fox sued the former <i>Saturday Night Live</i> performer and his publisher, the Penguin Group, to stop them from including 'fair and balanced' in the title of his upcoming book. Filed Monday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, the trademark infringement lawsuit seeks to force Penguin to rename <i>Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right</i>, scheduled for release next month. ... 'I normally prefer not to be out of the country on vacation when I'm sued. However, from everything I know about law regarding satire, I'm not worried.'"
<p>

[<i>The lawsuit claims that the title will trick the public into believing that Fox News Channel published the book. Jesus Christ, the freaking thing is called </i>Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right<i>. If they actually believe that their audience will get confused by this, then they're effectively calling their own viewers morons.</i>]

"A Florida dad is in jail, after he allegedly left his kids in a pickup truck while he visited a strip club. Police in Tampa say Olvin Pabon paid a $20 cover at the Deja Vu bar, and spent about 20 minutes inside. A security guard outside heard crying and found the four children in the pickup truck. Security officers and several patrons blocked Pabon's pickup truck until police arrived."
