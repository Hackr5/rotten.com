"A Dougherty County woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to repeatedly 'renting' prepubescent girls to a known child molester for up to $30 per half-hour. Mary Helen Harris was sentenced to 20 years in prison after she told the court she let James Charles Wescott Sr., 68, rent girls for sex between June 2001 and June 2002... Harris described how she would grant Wescott a half-hour of access to the children for anywhere from $5 to $30. Wescott would tip the children about $5 afterward - money she would also take." But it was well-earned. One time, "Harris brought the older man baby oil because he couldn't penetrate one of his victims."

"Neil Bush, younger brother of President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a>, detailed lucrative business deals and admitted to engaging in sex romps with women in Asia in a deposition taken in March as part of his divorce from now ex-wife Sharon Bush... The Bush divorce, completed in April after 23 years of marriage, was prompted in part by Bush's relationship with another woman. He admitted in the deposition that he previously had sex with several other women while on trips to Thailand and Hong Kong at least five years ago. The women, he said, simply knocked on the door of his hotel room, entered and had sex with him. He said he did not know if they were prostitutes because they never asked for money and he did not pay them. 'Mr Bush, you have to admit it's a pretty remarkable thing for a man just to go to a hotel room door and open it and have a woman standing there and have sex with her,' Brown said. 'It was very unusual,' Bush said."

Within a month the 51-year-old had killed two prostitutes and cut up their bodies with a hacksaw, a court heard yesterday. A year earlier, he had murdered another woman and police said he would have got away with it if had he not killed again... But, in November 2002, mental health managers freed him saying they did not believe he was mentally ill."

"From Cape Cod in Massachusetts to McClellan Air Force Base in California, the Pentagon is facing mounting criticism for failing to clean up military sites contaminated with everything from old munitions to radioactive materials and residues from biological-weapons research... Last December, Defense officials drew up a 24-page strategy memorandum, laying out a plan for a 'multi-year campaign' to exempt the military from federal laws including the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Clean Air Act, as well as rules governing solid and hazardous wastes. The strategy also called for Congress to state 'that munitions deposited and remaining on operational ranges are not "solid wastes"' - a move that with one stroke would exempt the Pentagon from having to clean up the old shells, fuels, and other weapons 'constituents.'"

"At least 19 people who had gone to a county fair in Ohio in 2001 fell ill with E. coli after the bacteria apparently spread through sawdust in the air at an exhibition hall - the first time researchers have connected an outbreak to a contaminated building. Testing at the building in Lorain County found E. coli O157 in the rafters, the walls and the sawdust - in some cases 10 months after the fair... Tainted food is the most common source of E. coli outbreaks, which cause an average of 61 deaths and 73,000 illnesses a year in the United States.

The request - which has some suppliers furious and others busy re-labeling components - came after an unidentified worker spotted a videotape machine carrying devices labeled 'master' and 'slave' and filed a discrimination complaint with the county's Office of Affirmative Action Compliance... 'Based on the cultural diversity and sensitivity of Los Angeles County, this is not an acceptable identification label,' Joe Sandoval, division manager of purchasing and contract services, said in a memo sent to County vendors...

"<a href=http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/music/michael-jackson/">Jackson</a>'s legal team is said to be encouraging him to consider a plea bargain, possibly an insanity defence that would allow him to serve time in a state mental hospital instead of jail. There was speculation yesterday that the singer raised his $3 million bail with the help of Miami-based Al Malnik, a lawyer for notorious gangster <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/crime/mafia/meyer-lansky/">Meyer Lansky</a>, who died in 1983. Malnik reportedly began making large loans to Jackson when his career nosedived. Malnik, 69, was cited by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1980 and 1992 as a person of unsuitable character."
