"The former American diplomat who exposed false claims that Iraq was trying to purchase uranium from Niger has accused members of the Bush administration of a dirty tricks campaign against him. The revelation of Joseph Wilson's investigation in the African state forced President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">George Bush</a> to retract claims about Iraq's attempts to buy uranium made in his State of the Union speech two months before the war began. The Administration is alleged to have <b>leaked the name</b> of Mr Wilson's wife, <b>an undercover CIA operative</b> in the field of weapons of mass destruction, with the aim of discrediting him. ... US intelligence officials and the Democrats are furious about the move, arguing that it jeopardises Ms Plame's work and undermines her husband. They have called for an inquiry."

An eyewitness said between 11.30am and noon on Tuesday, a cocoa grower from a village along the Kuradui road shouted out in Tok Pidgin for everyone to come out of the shop at Talina -- telling them to take a look at 'this boy who stole my cocoa.' The eyewitness said the young man was stripped naked, had five fingers on his right hand slashed and was dripping blood.

The silver-haired Brooklyn judge was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs to begin a three- to nine-year prison term for taking thousands of dollars in bribes -- perhaps the most troubling scene so far in a judicial corruption scandal that one watchdog group calls the worst in the nation."

"Japan has tried all sorts of remedies to pull itself out of a 13-year economic slump, from huge public works projects to bailouts of failing companies. Many experts have concluded that the expanding the role of women in professional life could provide a far bigger stimulus than any scheme tried so far. But it often seems that the Japanese would rather let their economy stagnate than send their women up the corporate ladder. ... Earlier this year, former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, a member of a government commission charged with finding solutions to the population crisis, was widely quoted as saying the main reason for Japan's falling birthrate was the overeducation of its women. Mr. Koizumi's top aide, Yasuo Fukuda, was recently quoted as saying that often women who are raped deserve it, while a legislator from the governing party said, approvingly, that the men who carried out such acts were virile and 'good specimens.'"

"A team of Dutch filmmakers who said they had made a documentary about a snippet of film showing Vincent van Gogh admitted Monday that the claim was a hoax, the Dutch national news service said. The filmmakers had claimed a grainy passer-by in the film was the brilliant but troubled painter. Van Gogh committed suicide in 1890, when photography was still young and celluloid film had scarcely been invented. ... The film supposedly lay for almost a century in a damp attic before it was discovered in 1984 and restored."

"A widely publicized project to transform a man-made platform in the English Channel into a 'safe haven' for controversial Web businesses has failed due to political, technical and management problems, one of the company's founders said. ... HavenCo is located on a rusting, basketball-court-size fortress erected by the British military during World War II to shoot down Nazi aircraft. Roy Bates, the quirky 'crown prince' of 'Sealand' landed on the abandoned platform in 1966 and claimed it as an independent nation with its own currency, stamps and flag. Although its legal status is unclear, Sealand lies within the territorial boundary of 10 miles claimed by England. ... A Sealand representative said in an e-mail interview on Monday that 'HavenCo is a viable operation.'"

"A Wildwood man who bragged on television that he dumped his girlfriend for her mother was sentenced to one year in prison Thursday for criminal sexual contact. ... When Cape May County prosecutors watched the show on tape after being given a tip, they listened as Alexander and his 22-year-old girlfriend, Rita Koelle (pictured, right), spoke of their 7-year-old child, one of Koelle's five children. After doing the math, they charged Alexander with endangering the welfare of a child and second-degree sexual assault for having sex with Koelle when she was underage. He had been 20 years old at the time the child was born."
