Bush's call for a return to space would give Americans something new to hope for - amid a period of permanent anxiety about terrorism. It would also help move NASA beyond last February's space shuttle Columbia disaster. Sources said the president may also give the go-ahead to pursue a manned trip to Mars - a long range goal."

The sixth-grader tried to escape her home in Stockbridge just south of Atlanta, but she was only punished more severely - she was left without food, water, a bathroom or a bed, police said. The girl's father, 37-year-old Rodney Michael Reaves, and her stepmother, 38-year-old Charlott Lynett Reaves, were arrested Monday and charged with felony murder and cruelty to children. The girl, Joella Reaves, was beaten over her entire body with an umbrella and paddle for several days, according to the arrest warrant. Her cause of death was listed as blunt force trauma."

"Waynetta Nolan, 36, used her vehicle to run over Sherry Allen Jenkins, 43, a <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/crime/corporate/mcdonalds/">McDonald's</a> manager, prosecutors said, because her drive-through order was wrong... Nolan was verbally abusive to employees of the restaurant in the 10400 block of Bissonnet on April 23. When Jenkins told her to not talk that way, she then went outside to write down Nolan's license number. Nolan hit her with her car... 'She'd seen me. She laughed when she ran me over,' Jenkins said. 'She'd seen me. There's nothing wrong with this lady, but she needs to go to a penitentiary.'"

"This high-tech 'system' - the Kevlar vest and 'small-arms protective inserts,' which the troops call SAPI plates - is dramatically reducing the kind of torso injuries that have killed soldiers on the battlefield in wars past. Soldiers will not patrol without the armor - if they can get it. But as of now, there is not enough to go around. Going into the war in Iraq, the Army decided to outfit only dismounted combat soldiers with the plated vests, which cost about $1,500 each... Last month, Rep. Ted Strickland (D-Ohio) and 102 other House members wrote to Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, to demand hearings on why the Pentagon had been unable to provide all U.S. service members in Iraq with the latest body armor. In the letter, the lawmakers cited reports that soldiers' parents had been purchasing body armor with ceramic plates and sending it to their children in Iraq." [<i>Again we say: this is totally unacceptable. There shouldn't be <b>any</b> of this stuff sitting on retail shelves. The Pentagon ought to buy up all remaining stocks and ship them to Iraq.</i>]

"Patricia Vanlester, 41, was knocked unconscious and, her sister said, 'trampled by a herd of elephants' by a stampede of shoppers reaching for DVD players that went on sale at 6 a.m. the day after Thanksgiving, according to Orange City police and the sister, Linda Ellzey... An investigation by WKMG-Local 6 reveals Vanlester has filed 16 previous claims of injuries at <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/crime/corporate/wal-mart/">Wal-Mart</a> stores and other places she has shopped or worked, according to Wal-Mart, court files and state records. Her sister, who accompanied her Friday on the visit to Wal-Mart, has also filed a prior injury claim against Wal-Mart, with Vanlester as her witness, a company spokeswoman said yesterday... Vanlester has for years complained of head, back, neck, leg or arm pain caused by slipping and falling, objects falling on her and other accidents, according to medical records in a public court file examined by WKMG-Local 6."
