somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

According to the daily <i>Liberation</i>, one passage compared the fate of the Jewish people to the death of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/religion/jesus-christ/">Jesus Christ</a>. Another section said some Jews had paranoid reactions to the Holocaust while non-Jews felt overly guilty. ... one passage in the book spoke of <i>'the Jewish people, who have only very distant and politically very suspect links with real Judaism.'</i> Another passage said the Holocaust had prompted <i>'very odd behaviour among Jews and non-Jews, making both very sensitive to any possible resurgence of anti-Semitism. This amounts to an almost paranoid tendency on the one side and often unhealthy guilt feelings on the other.'"</i>

"In July 1980, almost 300 children who were competing in a brass band competition in a field near Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, were hit by vomiting, runny noses and sore eyes. The cause of the children's symptoms was never pinpointed, however health authorities at the time suggested it was a result of mass hysteria. But an investigation by BBC's <i>Inside Out</i> documentary team has discovered that the pesticide tridemorph -- which was sprayed near the fields at the time of the incident but later banned in 2000 -- may have caused the reaction. ... The official explanation for the fainting incident is still mass hysteria, although other causes such as <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/wmd/nerve-agents/">nerve gas</a>, contaminated water, radio waves and food poisoning were also considered."
