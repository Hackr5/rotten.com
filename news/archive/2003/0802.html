"Few things exemplify the chaos of Liberia more than the sight of doped-up, AK-47-wielding 15-year-olds roaming the streets decked out in fright wigs and tattered wedding gowns. Indeed, some of the more fully accessorized soldiers in Charles Taylor's militia even tote dainty purses and don feather boas. ... According to the soldiers themselves, cross-dressing is a military mind game, a tactic that instills fear in their rivals. It also makes the soldiers feel more invincible. This belief is founded on a regional superstition which holds that soldiers can 'confuse the enemy’s bullets' by assuming two identities simultaneously. ... Since flak jackets or infrared goggles aren’t available to the destitute Liberian fighters, they opt for evening gowns and frilly blouses."

"A car crash this week in a town near New Orleans revealed that a building thought to be a home improvement business was actually a white supremacist church, police said on Friday. The vehicle smashed into the brick storefront in Chalmette, Louisiana, after colliding with two other cars and came to rest amid stacks of racist books and pamphlets, including <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/nazi/adolf-hitler/">Adolf Hitler</a>'s <i>Mein Kampf</i>, they said. A sign proclaimed the building the 'Southern Home Improvement Center' ... but investigators found out it was the New Christian Crusade Church and headquarters of the Christian Defense League. Both organizations were the projects of building owner James Warner, a founder of the American <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/nazi/">Nazi</a> Party and associate of former <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/racism/kkk/">Ku Klux Klan</a> Grand Wizard and Republican gubernatorial candidate <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/david-duke/">David Duke</a>."

"Colorado authorities joined their colleagues in Utah on Friday in blaming 45 Denver-area cat slayings in the past year on wildlife, ending weeks of suspicion that budding psychopaths and devil worshippers were killing the pets. ... 'All of the deaths were caused by predators,' Police Chief Ricky Bennett said in suburban Aurora, where 29 cases were reported. Pet owners' reactions were mixed. 'I would be thrilled to know it was something natural, but I would like it explained to me,' said Christy Hughes, who assumed a fox killed her cat in June until animal control officers persuaded her humans were to blame."

"A man was fatally electrocuted by a faulty karaoke microphone lead in Vietnam, police said on Friday. Dang Tuan Hoang Than, 24, died after being electrocuted during a karaoke session at his home in Ho Chi Minh, said Nguyen Minh Hoang, a police officer from Trung An commune. 'Only his mother was at home at the time, and by the time she managed to switch off the power, Than's whole body had turned dark purple,' said Hoang."

"A post office and surrounding area were evacuated after a mail carrier came across a suspicious, vibrating package. ... U.S. Postal Service spokesman Michael Miles said the package aroused suspicion from a carrier and his supervisor, who took the priority-listed mail into the parking lot and called police. The Gwinnett County bomb squad, U.S. <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/conspiracy/batf/">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</a> and the Gwinnett County Fire Department evacuated the building and the parking lot Wednesday and shut down a nearby street. ... When it was opened, authorities found adult toys, including a vibrator and massage oil."

"The Trusted Platform Module... designed by the Trusted Computing Group, will encrypt and decrypt documents and is said to ensure that documents are stored in secure places of a PC. ... Privacy advocates have criticised the TPM system saying that rather than securing data, it will be used to monitor consumers' use of music, film and software for licensing purposes. However, Intel and Wave have rejected that their agreement relates to DRM (digital rights management), though Wave does supply products for that purpose." [<i>Yes, it's evil.</i>]
