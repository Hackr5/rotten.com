On the first full day this page went live, 100,000 people visited this Rotten

somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"Joseph Gottschalk, 52, received international media attention after the <i>San Antonio Express-News</i> wrote of his habit of riding around Southside Lions Park wearing nothing but a thong.  ... Peering down a sharp drop, the hikers saw Gottschalk’s body on a wide ledge about 100 feet below, park spokesman David Elkowitz said. ... Rangers said they found no sign of foul play nor any kind of note. ... In May, Gottschalk, who had become better known to many as 'Thong Man,' served as grand marshal for a parade of thong-wearers vying for free Spurs playoff tickets. Earlier this month, however, he was arrested for stripping down to a sack. While Gottschalk’s thong had covered body parts required by law, the tan bag he was wearing did not meet that legal standard." [<i>Goodbye, Thong Man.

"[King Mswati III of Swaziland] sternly warned prospective candidates not to murder innocent people in order to harvest their body parts to make a 'muti' to bring good fortune. 'During election times, we tend to lose our grandmothers, grandfathers and young children. They just disappear. But I want to warn you all that you should not resort to ritual murder,' Mswati said. Addressing more than 15 000 people at Ludzidzini Royal Village, 20km east of Mbabane, the king emphasised: 'Don't do that, because you might get caught and then you will not achieve your dream of going to Parliament.' ... Before the last parliamentary poll in 1998, the number of corpses with missing body parts discovered in rural or peri-urban areas increased from the usual three or four a year to more than a dozen. ... Mswati wants the first Parliament under a new constitutional dispensation to be elected without homicide, and is urging candidates to stick to conventional means of campaigning."

"Sexsomnia can affect both men and women. While the causes are unknown, researchers suspect stress, chronic sleepiness, or alcohol or drug abuse may play a role. Seizure disorders, an injury to the brain, or a history of physical or sexual abuse may also be triggers. In some cases, nocturnal sex may be considered 'odd but still within present social norms,' the authors write, 'particularly if the partner is a willing participant.' ... [But there have been] several cases of men who were charged with sexually assaulting their partners, or even their own children. All were 'exculpated' after doctors found evidence of sexsomnia, and the study suggests cases of alleged sexual molestation should be investigated for evidence of the sleep sex disorder -- a prospect that alarms groups who work with sex assault victims."

"Tracy the Burmese Python -- who has been missing for 24 hours -- has not been fed for over two weeks and is capable of eating small animals. Paul Tomlinson, 34, of Wincobank Lane, Grimesthorpe, Sheffield, warned that if she was threatened, the three-year-old constrictor snake could kill a small child. ... "If any adult spots her I would advise that they wash their hands then go up to her and pick her up. She might puff up a bit and look a bit intimidating but she never strikes humans." [<i>Except for children.</i>]

"Goat meat, cows' feet and decaying chicken made up some of the 30 tons of illegal meat seized in east London. Food safety officers backed up by 50 police officers raided an unlicensed food plant... They found the place was infested with rats and mice and found so much illegal meat it took them a day to remove it.  ... It is thought the meat, which was meant to become pet food, was bought at abattoirs to be repacked and sold for human consumption."
