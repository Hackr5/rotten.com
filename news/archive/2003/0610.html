"A move by the House of Lords to outlaw sex in public toilets has been slammed as 'blatantly homophobic' by gay rights campaigners. ... 'By singling out public toilets it targets sex behaviour between gay men and ignores sex in other public places involving heterosexuals. Sex outside the privacy of a person's own home should only be a crime if it is witnessed by members of the public and causes them offence.'"

"A Sydney company is involved in a secret plan to collect tissue from aborted babies and export it for medical experiments. The sensitive proposal, to harvest some of the 90,000 foetuses aborted in Australia each year has been condemned by pro-life groups for fostering an international trade in human body parts. ... It is believed to be the first proposed commercial collection of foetuses in Australia, but those behind the project were hoping to carry it out without the public knowing."
