The speech marked the start of a monthlong effort by the Justice Department to rebut criticism from civil liberties groups and politicians of both parties who say the Patriot Act has undercut civil liberties and jeopardized constitutional rights. ... The Patriot Act, Ashcroft said, allows the government to 'anticipate, adapt and outthink our terrorist enemy.
