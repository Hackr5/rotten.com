"A follower of the Falun Gong cult has shocked society by poisoning 17 innocent people, most beggars or vagrants, from May 25 to June 27 this year under the Falun Gongcult doctrines, according to a commentary to be carried in Tuesday's <i>People's Daily</i>. By now more than 1,700 innocent people have been killed by Falun Gong cult followers in practicing the cult's doctrines of 'clearing crimes committed in a previous life' or 'complete oneself in this life' either by killing themselves or killing others. ... The crime once again showed that the cult still threatens society's stability and safety and the crimes once again ridicule the cult's so-called doctrines of 'truth, kindness and tolerance,' the commentary says."

"They are among America's larger companies: Verizon Communications, AT&T Wireless, Barnes & Noble booksellers and Dole Food Co. But in the government's contractor database, they are listed as <b>small businesses</b>. The mistaken designations... mean the government has overstated the contract dollars that are going to small business at a time when the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> administration has been pressing to give smaller companies as much federal work as possible. ... Once a company's status is mischaracterized, it stays that way through the life of a contract -- which can be 20 years. That means smaller firms that the administration intended to help may be frozen out from fresh business by the bigger companies with the incorrect designations." Coincidentally, one of the miscategorized firms is a subsidiary of Halliburton.

"Paul Baker, a lecturer at Lancaster University, has been researching the dialect for six years and has written three books on the subject, including a dictionary of more than 200 words and phrases. ... The origins of Polari probably lie in the 19th-century slang Parlyaree used by fairground and circus people, as well as prostitutes and beggars, and it also has links to the older vocabularies of other stigmatised groups or outsiders such as thieves' cant, cockney rhyming slang, yiddish and the lingua franca of sailors. Usage reached its peak in the repressive 1950s when being gay was illegal and dangerous: men lived in constant fear of blackmail, exposure and the humiliation of electric shock and hormone 'treatments,' as well as imprisonment."

"Australia is giving itself the option of becoming a nuclear power through a deal with the US to obtain <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/atomic-bomb/">nuclear weapons</a> and extensive investment in atomic expertise, it has been claimed. A leading strategic policy expert says Australia is forging an understanding with the US that would ensure quick access to 'off the shelf' tactical nuclear weapons during a crisis. And a former senior Howard Government science adviser says the new $600 million reactor at Lucas Heights will ensure Australia has the skills and technology to launch a nuclear weapons program. ... A spokeswoman for the Federal Government said the claims were 'absurd'. 'Australia is a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has made a legal commitment to not acquire nuclear weapons, and this is enshrined in legislation,' spokeswoman Willie Herron said."

"The U.S. Supreme Court -- already in the news this week for its decisions on affirmative action -- is highlighted in a scientific journal. ... Lawrence Sirovich, a mathematician at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, calculated that the current Supreme Court of nine judges behaves as if it were made up of about 4.68 'ideal' judges -- adjudicators who make their decisions completely independently of each other. To put that figure in perspective, Sirovich says, a court with a strict liberal-conservative divide would behave as if it had only one judge because all decisions would be determined purely by which faction made up the majority."

"As a 37-year-old Norwegian man fell asleep on the street, extremely drunk after a night on the town in Denmark, his 7-year-old son was watching over him. ... At the end of the evening the father was so drunk he fell asleep on the pavement, according to <i>Dagbladet</i>. The man's 7-year-old son was sat on the pavement watching over his drunken dad. After a while, some locals discovered the father and his son and called the police, who arrived just after midnight."

"A doctor who recommended that thousands of his patients use marijuana is facing charges that could cost him his medical license, but the physician and his supporters say the case is merely an attempt to hush a vocal advocate for medicinal use of the drug. Tod H. Mikuriya, 69, wrote marijuana recommendations for 7,500 of his patients without conducting sufficient medical examinations, according to officials with the Medical Board of California, which has moved to revoke or suspend the doctor's license. ... Mikuriya, a psychiatrist specializing in the history of medical cannabis, insists marijuana is very effective in alleviating chronic pain, muscle spasms, depression and alcoholism."

"As a troubled youngster, Landon May worried he had inherited 'bad blood' from his father, a notorious killer on Pennsylvania's death row. Now, on death row himself for the torture killings of a school principal and her husband, May is hoping the state Supreme Court might give him another chance to argue he was fated to follow in his father's violent footsteps. In an unusual appeal, May's lawyer said experts should have been allowed to testify when jurors were deliberating May's sentence that he was genetically predisposed to violence, given his family history."

"A motorist who allegedly hit and killed a 3-year-old boy was dragged from his car and beaten by a group of men who saw the crash... More than a dozen men, friends of the boy's father, saw the crash and stopped the car about a half-block away... The men dragged Martinez, 37, out of the driver's seat and punched him in the head several times... After the beating, Martinez walked back to see how the child was doing, then said he was going to leave because he didn't have a driver's license... The group of men pounced on him again."
