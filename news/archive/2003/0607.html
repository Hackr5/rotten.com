"That was the scam: crush the bones of homeless people so desperate for a buck that they'd allow their own bodies to be maimed for money, then hit up insurance companies with a sob story about how badly and quickly their hurt 'relatives' needed the cash settlements. ... In most cases the injury would be a compound fracture with the bone showing through the skin, Bigg said -- the better to persuade insurance companies to come up with big settlements. ... Once the insurance checks were issued, the perpetrators would cash them at currency exchanges. The injured people 'got anything from nothing to $1,500' on settlements between $10,000 and $100,000."

"Of 2,088 deaths caused by overdoses last year, 60 percent were caused by legal medications while 40 percent were the result of illicit drugs... Cocaine and heroin killed more than 677 Floridians last year, but prescription drugs claimed 1,075 lives, a trend underway for several years. ... Not to be forgotten, alcohol directly caused 306 deaths and was a contributing factor in 3,013 others, far and away the most prevalent death-related substance in the report."

"Jessica Parks was born without arms. Friday, the 18-year-old put her contact lenses in with a toe, ate breakfast using utensils held in her feet, went to her part-time job as a secretary, then traveled to a Saturn dealership in Oakland County where she was presented with a new car and a cake, which she sliced with a plastic fork gripped between two toes. ... For kicks, she moves her foot to the top of the wheel at stoplights and watches for the reactions of other drivers." [<i>And people say we don't post any 'feel good' stories on Daily Rotten.</i>]
