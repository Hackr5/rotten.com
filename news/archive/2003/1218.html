'As you read the report, you're going to have a pretty clear idea what wasn't done and what should have been done,' [Thomas Kean] said. 'This was not something that had to happen.'

Cahum Pech, who was tied loosely to the beam by the neck, jumped to avoid the blows, which were delivered by his sister, 13, and brother, 8, with the traditional pinata sing-song rhyme, <i>'Hit it, Hit it, Really Hard.'</i> While he twisted to avoid one blow, Cahum pech fell from the beam, tightening the rope around his neck and leading him to die of asphyxiation."

"Andrew S. Natsios, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said earlier this year that U.S. taxpayers would not have to pay more than $1.7 billion to reconstruct Iraq - which turned out to be a gross understatement of the tens of billions of dollars the government now expects to spend. Recently, however, the government has purged the offending comments by Natsios from the agency's Web site... For months after the April 23 Natsios interview on ABC's <i>Nightline</i>, USAID.gov displayed the transcript. 'You're not suggesting that the rebuilding of Iraq is going to be done for $1.7 billion?' an incredulous Ted Koppel asked Natsios. 'Well, in terms of the American taxpayers contribution, I do,' Natsios said. 'This is it for the U.S. The rest of the rebuilding of Iraq will be done by other countries who have already made pledges, Britain, Germany, Norway, Japan, Canada and Iraqi oil revenues... But the American part of this will be $1.7 billion. We have no plans for any further-on funding for this.'"
