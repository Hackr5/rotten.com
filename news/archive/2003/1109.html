"The <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> administration is seeking to block a group of American troops who were tortured in Iraqi prisons during the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/gulf-war/">Persian Gulf War</a> in 1991 from collecting any of the hundreds of millions of dollars in frozen Iraqi assets that they won last summer in a federal court ruling against the government of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam Hussein</a>... If the administration is successful, the former prisoners would be deprived both of the money they won and, they say, of the validation of a judge's ruling that documented their accounts of torture by the Iraqis - including beatings, burnings, starvation, mock <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/death/execution/">executions</a> and repeated threats of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/sex/castration/">castration</a> and dismemberment."

"A doctor at a state mental health facility changed patients' medications last year so that they would be eligible for a study of a new psychiatric drug, violating basic guidelines for research on human subjects... patients' medications were switched without informed consent and without a clear medical need, the changes were made more than two months before the human-studies review boards approved the research protocol, and the patients involved were clearly not eligible under the criteria for the study, which specified that subjects be outpatients. One of the four patients whose medication was switched, a man who had been stable for 10 years on the drug Clozaril, became so ill and acutely psychotic that he spent months in and out of hospital wards."

"An automotive convenience that most people wouldn't consider dangerous, power windows have been blamed for at least 28 deaths since 1990, most of them children ages 3 and younger. Hundreds more are injured each year in power window accidents, including kids who have lost fingers or suffered crushed wrists or hands after the windows quickly zoomed up, exerting forces of up to 80 pounds in a matter of seconds... Power window injuries to pet dogs also have been reported."

"Deep Purple are considering donating some very special memorabilia to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: two of their CDs that were on the space shuttle Columbia. Astronaut Kalpana Chawla was a fan of the band and took three CDs into space: Deep Purple's <i>Machine Head</i> and <i>Down To Earth</i> [!?!], and Rainbow's <i>Purpendicular</i>... The discs were found in the debris, and Chawla's husband gave them back to the band during their Mexico City concert in September."
