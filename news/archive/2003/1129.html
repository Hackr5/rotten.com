"A rookie Manila policeman, apparently insulted by doubts on whether he was a real cop, went into a shooting rampage during a birthday party here Friday night, killing two guests and critically wounding two others, including a fellow lawman. Probers said PO1 Jonathan Baugh, assigned with the Western Police District's Station 3 at Central Market in Sta. Cruz, Manila, was waving his WPD identification card as he fired shots at a group of guests he had been drinking with. Laborer Rodel Dumalaog, 43, and tricycle driver Fernando Bagnes, 37, both residents of Barangay Canlubang, died while being rushed to the San Jose Hospital. Both had multiple gunshot wounds... Calamba policemen are now coordinating with the WPD for the arrest of Baugh, who escaped after the incident."

"Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali, who died on Wednesday aged 77, was the 'hanging judge' of the Iranian revolution, responsible for sending hundreds, possibly thousands, of people to their deaths; he became notorious in the West after he appeared on television poking the charred corpses of American servicemen killed in an unsuccessful bid to rescue hostages held in the American embassy in Tehran... Khalkhali acted as prosecutor, judge and jury in his own cases, regarding his rulings as 'the judgment and conscience of 35 million people.' He developed a new judicial concept called 'obvious guilt' - whereby the accused is presumed guilty if his or her 'crimes' were 'very clear' prior to the trial... Many of Khalkhali's victims were Iranian Kurds, on whom <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/religion/ayatollah-khomeni/">Ayatollah Khomeini</a> had declared a holy war in August 1979. At the height of the terror, up to 60 Kurds a day were being sentenced to death by Khalkhali's itinerant kangaroo court."

"Authorities on Friday pleaded with the public to call in any tip, 'no matter how insignificant it may appear,' as they investigated a string of 10 shootings along an interstate and nearby highway. Gail Knisley, 62, of Washington Court House, was killed Tuesday when a bullet tore through the door of a car she was riding in on Interstate 270. Franklin County Chief Deputy Sheriff Steve Martin said that 'nine other similar shooting-type incidents (have been) committed in the same general area' - eight in the last two months and one in May... Authorities have said that ballistics tests tie Knisley's shooting to at least one other case. They studiously have avoided using the word 'sniper.'"

Cops at the Santa Barbara County, Calif., Sheriff's Department, which is handling the case, discovered the microphone outside a door in an area popular with police taking smoking breaks... Cops are investigating the secret microphone, which was found Wednesday. They believe it may have been left by one of the hundreds of reporters who descended on the jail Nov. 20 for Jackson's surrender on charges he molested a 12-year-old boy during sleepovers at this Neverland Ranch."

"In 1984, when <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/crime/serial-killers/gary-leon-ridgway/">Gary Ridgway</a> wrote an anonymous letter to the <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i>, it was the only known time he surfaced to communicate through the media. But at the time, an <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/conspiracy/fbi/">FBI</a> profiler said the letter's author wasn't the killer. Now the profiler, John Douglas, acknowledges that he was wrong... Douglas, a project manager in the FBI's criminal profiling program at the time, reviewed the two-page letter and decided the letter's author 'has no connection with the Green River homicides,' according to his letter to a detective on the Green River Task Force. Douglas said the author had access to the task force and that the letter was a 'feeble and amateurish attempt to gain some personal importance by manipulating the investigation.' ... Douglas, who has worked many high-profile cases, said he had been recovering from stress-related viral encephalitis, a near-death illness, at the time he analyzed the letter. 'I was still going through rehabilitation. Maybe I shouldn't have analyzed it then.'"

One of the obstacles to establishing the system, the <i>Canadian Law Times</i> said, has been the Muslim communities' lack of unity and organizational strength. Muslims in Canada come from many different countries and different schools of Islam. Also, there are few Islamic legal scholars, known as <i>ulama</i>, in North America, which are essential to adjudicating complex issues."

"The man suspected of selling old sticks of dynamite to children in a Modesto neighborhood has turned himself into authorities, but his girlfriend says he didn't do anything illegal. Darrell Arnold Jr. contacted the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department Monday night... Investigators arrested Arnold, but they said they do not have all the dynamite in question... The investigation began at the Modesto Inn on Needham Street on Sunday. Someone called police, saying a person had parked a truck with a stick of dynamite in the back alongside the building. That stick was later destroyed. The dynamite led to a search for Arnold, who authorities believed was selling the dynamite to children for $10 to $15 a stick. The main focus of the investigation now is to find the remaining sticks of dynamite. 'This dynamite is very old, and it's extremely volatile. And so we are very concerned that if someone tries to move it, it could be detonated,' Letras said."

"Scientists have invented a credit-card chip they claim can be implanted into your arm, allowing you to authorise payments by simply standing near a cash register. The tiny chip, the size of a grain of rice, uses radio waves to tell registers or cash machines who you are. Experts believe it could replace credit cards and other forms of ID card... Simon Davies, director of human rights group Privacy International, said: 'This is an invasion of privacy on a level we have never seen before. Once this chip is implanted, it's going to be impossible to leave at home or cut up, as you can with a credit card. It could also allow companies to track your every move, and the only way to stop them would be to undergo a surgical procedure to have the chip removed. And what happens if it malfunctions? It's an idea born out of pure craziness.'"

"A website has dog owners upset and the person behind it is hoping no one will find out who he is. When KATU news started asking questions about the controversial website, the investigation took a very disturbing turn... since this summer's dog poisonings at Laurelhurst Park, the public, the police, and KATU News has been taking a closer look... The site no longer had photographs of dog owners and their unleashed pets. It was linked to a pornography site, with [KATU reporter] Anna Song's name posted throughout it. KATU contacted the webhost, which took the site down that night."

"Judge Ripley Eagles Rand of Raleigh ordered deputies Wednesday to go to the department store after he found a shortage of possible jurors for a murder trial set to begin Monday... Rand ordered the deputies to go to <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/crime/corporate/wal-mart/">Wal-Mart</a> because he said shoppers at the store would be representative of the county. He instructed the officers not to enlist anyone burdened with packages or small children... This was the second time in 15 months Rand ordered deputies to find jurors at a Wal-Mart."
