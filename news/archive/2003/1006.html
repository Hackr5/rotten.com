"A peddler of water purifiers poisoned a reservoir in central China to boost flagging sales, sickening 64 people, state media said on Monday. Cao Qianjin, 27, was detained on Sunday for tossing pesticides into the reservoir in Ruyang County in the central province of Henan, the official <i>Xinhua</i> news agency reported. Cao, a laid-off worker, admitted to poisoning the water in hopes of boosting sales of his goods... Cao bought 20 bottles of a pesticide named '3911' and threw 500 ml into the reservoir, which supplies 9,000 families in the county, on September 30, it said. About 64 residents were poisoned and 42 of them were sent to hospital. On Saturday, the last six victims were released from hospital and the water facility was reopened."

"James Arthur Marriner, 43, had pleaded not guilty to 16 charges including assault and indecent assault, but was convicted on 14 counts by a Brisbane District Court jury last Friday... Marriner, who was a sergeant based at Ipswich in Queensland's south-east, became involved with members of the Christian Brethren, a conservative religious group with strict rules, including prohibitions on watching films and television. The court was told Marriner had convinced the group they had to cut off their pubic hair, and take photos of themselves naked on the pretext such actions were mandatory before becoming police informants... Marriner's recruiting procedures also involved taking samples of blood and <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/medicine/bodily-functions/pissing/">urine</a> and canvassing victims' sex lives through detailed questionnaires... After one woman sustained a needle-stick injury, Marriner told her she had contracted a sexually transmitted disease and needed tests which required her to <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/sex/masturbation/">masturbate</a> and provide a vaginal swab."

"Residents of this northern Idaho lakeside town can't rid themselves of Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler. After Butler lost his nearby compound to bankruptcy several years ago, he moved into a Hayden tract house bought by a supporter. Now he is running for mayor of this town of 9,000, again linking Hayden with his anti-Semitic, white separatist views... Butler, who used to keep a wooden bust of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/nazi/adolf-hitler/">Adolf Hitler</a> on display at his compound, moved to northern Idaho from California in the early 1970s because the region was mostly white and he figured it would make a good place to launch a race war."

The euphoria and lack of fear provided by the drugs, the police say, is giving desperate criminals the courage to carry out more crimes... 'Most of our criminals take these tablets before they act.

He noted that Daniel would defecate in his pants to get out of going to school, where both sides agreed he was bullied mercilessly. Daniel also had problems with body odor and bad breath. His mental health had deteriorated to the point where he would hide in a closet in his bedroom with three knives and a spear that was made by taping a blade to an old broomstick."

"<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/pornographers/larry-flynt/">Larry Flynt</a> is a realist when it comes to his chances of winning Tuesday's election to replace Governor Davis. The <i>Hustler</i> magazine publisher says he doesn't have a chance, after commissioning a survey in August that showed only 1 percent of voters supported him. According to his survey, only 10 percent of voters had a favorable opinion of Flynt, with 75 percent holding an unfavorable one."
