somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"Libyan leader <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/muammar-qaddafi/">Moammar Gadhafi</a> said the U.S.-led war on terror has strengthened <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda/">al-Qaida</a> because Muslims have perceived the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as aggression against Islam and attempts to spread American influence. In an interview airing Sunday on ABC's <i>This Week</i>, Gadhafi stressed that Libya was cooperating with the United States to fight terrorism and the 'common enemy' of al-Qaida. But he criticized America's foreign policy as colonialist and controlled by Jewish groups. He also said America's targeting of al-Qaida's leader Saudi-born dissident <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/crime/terrorists/osama-bin-laden/">Osama bin Laden</a> has transformed him into 'a symbol for defending the Islamic world.' He did not elaborate."

"An international cult leader was denied entry to the country on Saturday for his beliefs in human cloning, immigration officials said. Claude Vorilhon, also known as <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/religion/cult/rael/">Rael</a>, was forced to leave South Korea after being detained for nine hours at Incheon International Airport. The French founder of the Raelian Movement arrived at the airport at around 2:17 a.m. from Toronto, Canada, with his wife, but was prohibited from entering the country by immigration authorities. The Raelian Movement is a religious group that believes aliens landed on Earth 25,000 years ago and started the human race through cloning."

David Kay, a special adviser to the CIA, said solid progress was being made, but would not be drawn on whether any actual weapons of mass destruction (WMD) had been found. Mr Kay said that Iraqi scientists were revealing new secrets about work on WMD and progress was also being made to unravel the regime's concealment tactics. ... People 'should not be surprised by surprises,' he said." [<i>Perhaps we've already seen our first WMD "surprise," in the form of the mysterious toxin that killed National Guard Spec.

Acting on them, the Americans have raided homes and villages, seizing guns and explosives, arresting bodyguards and aides of Hussein.

"Tony Blair knows it is one of the most delicate of subjects. When asked about it he squirms and tries to change to a more comfortable line of inquiry. But quietly the Prime Minister is putting religion at the centre of the New Labour project, reflecting his own deeply felt beliefs that answers to most questions can be found in the Bible. The <i>Observer</i> can reveal that Blair is to allow Christian organisations and other 'faith groups' a central role in policy-making in a decisive break with British traditions that religion and government should not mix. The Prime Minister, who this weekend becomes the longest continually serving Labour Prime Minister in history, has set up a ministerial working group in the Home Office charged with injecting religious ideas 'across Whitehall'. One expert on the relationship between politics and religion described the move as a 'blow to secularism.'" [<i>And he seemed so reasonable...</i>]

"Catapulted by advances in biotechnology, scores of researchers have begun to pinpoint genes that may prolong human life while delaying its late-stage diseases, frailties and maybe even gray hair and wrinkles. Their successes in laboratory animals -- like worms that live four times longer than normal -- have already germinated several drug companies. ... Tom Johnson, a University of Colorado geneticist, thinks people could one day live to be 350 years old, spanning the ages like Methuselah and other biblical patriarchs."

"'Pound for pound, forget gold, forget diamonds. There is nothing more valuable on Earth than an inkjet cartridge.' ... If the ink were gasoline, it would cost you $175,000 to fill your gas tank. ... You buy an inkjet printer. It comes with ink cartridges, but they are only partially filled and do not last long. ... The makers of the printers -- Lexmark, Epson, Cannon, Hewlett-Packard -- make the ink cartridges. A typical cartridge costs $3 to $4 to produce, industry sources say. The price to you is 10 times that. ... 'Some of their inkjet cartridges have three colors--and when the ink runs out in one, the cartridge shuts down and you have to throw it out. Amazing. They've been banned in China, you know.'" [<i>Well, that's just China for you -- known throughout the world for their progressive consumer protection laws.</i>]

"Japanese businessmen will be able to cast off their ties and dress like <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/music/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a> with a new lineup of suits planned for next spring. ... The company, based in Gifu, central Japan, signed an agreement with a Singapore-based agent to use the 'MJ' logo, photographs and other designs evocative of the singer, he said. ... Jackson's licensed products are available elsewhere in the world, but the suits in Japan are believed to be a first. The 44-year-old is extremely popular among Japanese, many of whom love American pop."
