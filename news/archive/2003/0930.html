Each could face more than 100 years in prison if convicted on felony charges of criminal deviate conduct, battery and neglect. The teenager told police she'd been kept locked in a room in the basement for long periods since she arrived from California last month. She said her mother and stepfather beat her and burned her with cigarettes, and forced her to eat cigarettes. Police say the couple also used electrical wires to shock the teenager's toes, ears, head and genitals."

"A man confessed to killing a friend and drinking his blood, a murder trial heard yesterday. A jury was also told that police had found a horror book in the home of Allan Menzies, with handwritten notes stating: 'I have chosen my fate to become a vampire.' ... Police found a video and a DVD of a film, <i>Queen of the Damned</i>, which featured vampires and depicted sacrifices and the drinking of blood. Also, there was a paperback entitled <i>Blood and Gold</i>, the latest in a series of vampire chronicles by Anne Rice."

"A US ice-cream firm has settled a lawsuit brought by weight-watching customers -- by giving them extra ice-cream. Florida-based DeConna had been hit by a class-action court case, after complaints that its famous Big Daddy brand was not as low-fat as its advertising had claimed. Although marketed towards the health-conscious consumer, Big Daddy has three times as many calories as some labelling claimed, the plaintiffs argued. But in a $1m settlement of the two-year-old case, the firm has offered angry customers two scoops of ice-cream for every one they purchased."

"A Stagecoach Auckland bus driver was convicted yesterday of assault after dragging a 12-year-old girl off a school bus and leaving her kilometres from home on the side of the road in pouring rain. ... Ashleigh was pushed off the bus and after she called out that she needed her 'stuff,' Pritchard grabbed her bag, thrust it at her and pushed her out of the bus again. He told police he believed Ashleigh was being cheeky to him. ... Stagecoach Auckland has since offered Ashleigh a monthly bus pass."
