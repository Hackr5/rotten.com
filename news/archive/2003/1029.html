"Edwin Wilson was convicted in Houston in 1983 of smuggling arms to Libya at a time when the threat of Libyan terrorism was major news... Wilson claimed he shipped 20 tons of plastic explosives out of Houston Intercontinental Airport at the request of the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/conspiracy/cia/">CIA</a>. The federal government denied this, and at the heart of the case against him was a CIA affidavit submitted by prosecutors stating Wilson had not done any work for the CIA since his retirement in February 1971. But U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes spelled out in his order vacating Wilson's conviction, that the CIA forwarded a memo to the U.S. attorney's office a few days after he was convicted - but before he was sentenced - alerting them that they had since discovered at least five projects Wilson had worked on for the CIA after 1971 - including a planned trip to Iran with the CIA's deputy director... Documents provided for the court showed that Houston prosecutor Jim Powers participated in lengthy meetings at the Department of Justice, Hughes wrote, 'where they discussed techniques for dodging the plain meaning of the (CIA) affidavit and its contradictions.'"

Margaret Dale had refused to help engineering student James Bailey at the former High Peak College in Buxton in September 2001. He was told to 'go home and stop causing a scene' when he complained of feeling ill. Mr Bailey said she refused to call for an ambulance for him when he collapsed at the college. Shortly after collapsing he awoke to find a Mars bar being forced into his mouth, a hearing was told."

"Italy's Roman Catholic hierarchy faced intense embarrassment today after a cross used by the pope to celebrate the Church's Jubilee year was found abandoned in a rubbish dump. The bronze, six metre cross was discovered in the dump on the outskirts of Rome, Italy's RAI Due television reported. The two tonne cross formed the centrepiece of the celebrations when Pope John Paul II celebrated mass before an estimated two million young people at Tor Vergata, outside Rome, which became known as the 'Catholic Woodstock.' ... The discovery comes as Catholic cardinals and the political establishment are up in arms after a court ordered the removal of crucifixes from the classrooms of a state school after complaints from a radical Muslim leader."

Ashley Clarke, 18, has the most extreme case of Gower syndrome (vasovagal syncope) to be encountered by medical experts. It is caused by a reflex of the involuntary nervous system which leads the heart to slow down and nerves to blood vessels in the legs to widen... The condition means that unlike most other people, he benefits from his blood pressure being raised by salt and fatty foods such as chips, crisps and chocolate... He takes 600mg salt tablets 10 times a day and has several rounds of buttered toast for breakfast, a pizza or burger and chips for lunch and a roast dinner with more chips for tea."
