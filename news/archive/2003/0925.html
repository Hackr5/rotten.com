"A computer security expert who contributed to a paper deeply critical of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/crime/corporate/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> has been dismissed by his employer, a consulting company that works closely with the software giant. Dan Geer, a longtime computer security researcher, and several colleagues released a controversial study on Wednesday that called the ubiquity of Microsoft software a hazard to the economy and to national security. ... Cambridge, Mass-based @Stake, where Geer worked as chief technical officer, said in a statement Thursday that the researcher had not gotten his employers' approval for the study's release, and that he was no longer associated with the company. ... A Microsoft spokesman said the software maker had not pressured @Stake to make any decision on Geer's status. However, @Stake did call Microsoft late Tuesday night (after news of the report's contents first broke) to say that Geer's findings did not reflect his employer's opinions, the spokesman said."

Dillard claims three guards violated his civil rights by setting up the rapes over two days in March 1993 to punish him for kicking a guard at another prison. ... Dillard's attorney, Robert L. Bastian, Jr., said department records document at least 25 instances in which Robertson assaulted or raped cellmates between April 1983 and November 1997, earning him the 'Booty Bandit' nickname."

"Josh's roommate invited him to Harmony Church. Josh liked it, but when his parents came to visit, they didn't. ... They told their son about their concerns, and over the next few years, the concerns grew. ... Now Josh won't speak to his family. He even denies they're his parents. They went to Tulsa last week to fight a restraining order their son took out against them. The judge ruled in Josh's favor, and extended the order. They say Josh wouldn't even look at them in court."

"<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/comic/david-letterman/">David Letterman</a> found a bear in his cabin over the weekend, and needed help from a local teenager to get the animal to leave. ... 'There, standing in my kitchen, is the largest bear I've ever seen in my entire life,' he said. 'I don't know how big, but he was the hugest bear I've ever seen in my kitchen. ... So I closed the door.' ... After chasing the bear around the house for a few hours, they called in Lightner -- and his M-80s. They dropped the large firecrackers into a room where the bear was sleeping, chasing it out."

"Red Lobster management had badly miscalculated how many times customers would refill their plates after paying $20 for an 'endless' crab entree. Meanwhile, crab prices were going up, sending the profit margin crashing. 'It wasn't the second helping on all-you-can-eat but the third,' said company chairman Joe R. Lee on a conference call. 'And maybe the fourth,' added Rivera."

"Former U.S. Attorney General <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/janet-reno/">Janet Reno</a> said Tuesday that the anti-terrorist Patriot Act needs to be rewritten, and she criticized her successor's limits on federal prosecutors in pursuing plea bargains. Reno, who served as the nation's chief law enforcement officer under President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/bill-clinton/">Clinton</a>, said she is concerned that the Patriot Act allows too many people, including American citizens, to be held in military brigs as enemy combatants. ... Reno's successor, <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/john-ashcroft/">John Ashcroft</a>, remains a staunch advocate of the Patriot Act and said during a Monday speech in Pittsburgh that it only extended to terrorism existing law enforcement principles used to fight organized crime and drug trafficking."
