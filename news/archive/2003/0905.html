"Hoping to clear the way for eliminating the firing squad as a means of execution, a Utah commission asked for and received a statement from the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/religion/mormonism/">Mormon church</a> saying it does not oppose the change. In a one-sentence statement provided Wednesday to the Utah Sentencing Commission, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said it 'has no objection to the elimination of the firing squad in Utah.' The clarification was needed, according to one commission member, because of a purported church doctrine that held that justice was not done unless a murderer's blood was shed."

Walden O'Dell, chief executive of Diebold Inc., told Republicans in an Aug. 14 fund-raising letter that he is 'committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year.' The letter invited guests to a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser at O'Dell's suburban Columbus mansion and asked them to consider donating $10,000 each. The letter went out the day before Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, also a Republican, was set to qualify Diebold, based in Green, as one of three companies eligible to sell upgraded electronic voting machines to Ohio counties in time for the 2004 election."

"A group of women announced they would picket the former bodybuilder's campaign headquarters on Friday to protest what they call his misogynist views and crude behavior toward women. 'I am not concerned about what he does that is consensual,' said Karen Pomer, the founder of the Rainbow Sisters Project, a group of rape victims. 'But women who do not want to be touched who he touches -- the reports of him harassing women -- they are of great concern. It's degrading to women.' ... Some published articles have portrayed <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/actors/arnold-schwarzenegger/">Schwarzenegger</a> as touching women's bottoms and breasts without their consent. In a recent interview with Reuters, his best friend Franco Columbu confirmed that such incidents have taken place, such as when he touched the breasts of a British television presenter."

[<i>uh... <b>what?</b></i>] The sentence handed down to Dean Edmondson by Justice Fred Kovach outraged the family and friends of the victim, even as Kovach himself noted that this type of sexual assault traditionally results in a sentence of at least three years in a federal penitentiary. As the justice read the sentence, supporters and family members of the now 14-year-old aboriginal girl stormed out of the courtroom, yelling 'bullshit' and 'racism.' ...

"Chronically short of musicians for military funerals, the Pentagon has approved the use of a push-button bugle that plays taps by itself as the operator holds it to his lips. Only some 500 buglers are on active duty on any one day, but about 1,800 people with military service die across the country each day and are eligible for honors ceremonies... So the Defense Department worked with private industry to invent the 'ceremonial bugle,' which has a small digital recording device inserted into its bell to play the music. A member of the honor guard at the funeral simply presses a button on the device. A five-second delay gives the guards time to raise the instrument to their lips as if they are going to play it. ... it plays 'an exceptionally high-quality rendition of taps that is virtually indistinguishable from a live bugler,' the Pentagon said."
