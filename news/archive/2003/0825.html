Investigators have been unable to identify more than 12,000 remains -- from body parts weighing as much as 100 pounds to those as small as a tooth or a bone chip -- because in most cases the DNA, the genetic code unique to each individual, was too badly damaged... The remains are being slowly dried, and when they are free of moisture, they will be vacuum-sealed individually in white opaque pouches. ... 'We have gotten DNA from mummies that are 3,000 years old.

The incident happened late Friday at Faith Temple, a six-family church in a strip mall in north Milwaukee, Pastor David Hemphill said. ... The adults formed a circle around the boy and placed their hands lightly over him as they prayed for him, Hemphill said. ... At the end of the prayers, one of the women noticed that Terrance was not breathing. One of the adults called 911, but when emergency services arrived around 11 p.m., the boy was dead."

"While it's easy to jump to conclusions, even Dewerth remains skeptical of what he saw. 'It may or may not be a <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/cryptozoology/bigfoot/">Bigfoot</a>,' he said. 'But it's something.' That's the attitude of the 40 or so people who attended Saturday night's meeting of the Multi-State Bigfoot Research Roundtable -- a group that meets monthly and is dedicated to tracking down every viable reported Bigfoot sighting, hoping to find the one that finally produces conclusive evidence the giant bipedal mammal exists."

"The Kentucky Corrections Department's acting medical director is an admitted sex addict who has been accused of improperly touching four women who work for the department. ... The former Paducah obstetrician-gynecologist lost his medical license in 1994 after being accused of unethical conduct for having sex with about 10 female patients in Kentucky, as well as nurses, staff members and other health professionals. ... The newspaper obtained a copy of a 476-page deposition taken in August 2002 in which Crall said he still considers himself a sex addict but has brought his addiction under control by learning 'a new approach to sexuality that is non-compulsive and nondestructive.'"

"Georgia is facing default because it cannot pay out its debts and interest, the <i>RIA Novosti</i> correspondent quotes Zurab Soselia, Georgian deputy finance minister. According to him, the Georgian government 'has put up with the inability of International Monetary Fund to appear in September before the Paris Club of creditors as a partner in rescheduling Georgia's external debt.' ... Georgia is to pay $160.6 mln in 2003. Since the IMF has suspended its program of financial aid to Georgia, its budget cannot repay the sum: it lacks at least $50 mln, the deputy minister said. ... Georgia's external state debt totals almost $2 bln."

"A twice-fired former Memphis police officer was arrested Thursday morning for impersonating an officer. Lenora Geneva Armstead, 39, is accused of flashing a police badge to avoid walking through metal detectors at the Juvenile Court building on Washington with her 17-year-old daughter. ... When an officer at the door tried to make her wait in line with others attempting to enter the building and clear the metal detector, Armstead continued down the corridor, according to the arrest reports. ... She had been disciplined previously by the department for tying the same daughter to a bed to prevent the youngster from going out."

"Shaken by a series of controversies that focused unprecedented attention on her usually obscure office, Clark County Recorder Frances Deane wants to clear the air. ... Deane acknowledged making mistakes since she took office in January. But she attributed the flurry of damaging stories to leaks by enemies inside and outside her office. She said she expects those leaks to continue. ... she has been forced to develop a management strategy in which she tests their loyalty by lying to them and seeing if the lie later surfaces in the media. 'Here's the thing: I tell a selective lie to each one,' she explained. 'The next selective lie that I expect to come out is that I'm being audited by the IRS. I am not being audited by the IRS.'"
