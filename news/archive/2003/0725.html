"If you are looking for some fun, and have a research grant to spend, try this. Visit an American university, bump into random students in the corridor and loudly call each one 'asshole.' Then measure their reactions. This is what a team of psychologists did in a controlled experiment at the University of Michigan. ... Students from the southern part of the United States reacted far more violently and aggressively than those from the North, were shown to have much higher levels of cortisone and testosterone, and in tests regularly suggested more belligerent solutions to problems."

"Last year's Government Security Expo and Conference (mostly high tech) show was so successful with 175 exhibitors, organizers said, that they expanded it and added the 'U.S. Law Enforcement' show with its somewhat more nitty-gritty exhibits for the 'gun and badge' folks. ... [<i>For instance:</i>] Grant Haber, president of American Innovations Inc., a firm that makes bomb-resistant waste receptacles, said 'our nation's security infrastructure has been compromised' because the exact specs of many such trash cans have been revealed on the Web, a boon to terrorists. 'It's sickening,' he said, adding that he keeps his specs secret except from potential buyers."

"A war of words erupted between the owner of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/pornographers/bob-guccione/">Penthouse</a> Boutique and the city after the adult megastore was barred from opening at the last minute Thursday because it lacked a required permit. The boutique's grand opening party fizzled when the city notified owner Dan Quinn that he didn't have a police permit needed to open his porn emporium at 9 Banner Drive. The permit could take a month to acquire. In retaliation, Quinn vowed to give away $500,000 in adult products until a license is granted. ... About 20 demonstrators picketed outside the boutique Thursday, claiming that the pornography store would increase sex crimes in Milford and corrupt families and children."

His rare condition resulted in his nose being cleft in two as his face developed and his eyes being too far apart. ... during the operation -- known as facial bi-partition -- the bones in the youngster's face would be broken, excess material removed and the face pulled together again."
