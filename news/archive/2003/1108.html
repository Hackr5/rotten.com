"An aspiring rapper convicted of killing his roommate and <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/death/cannibalism/">eating</a> part of her lung was sentenced Friday to life in prison without the possibility of parole... Superior Court Judge Jack Morgan also imposed a consecutive life sentence on Antron Singleton, 27, convicted in June of murder and aggravated mayhem for the April 2002 slaying of Tynisha Ysais... Testimony showed that the 21-year-old woman's chest had been cut open and her right lung, which had been removed, appeared chewed and torn. Singleton, whose stage name was Big Lurch, was arrested after he was spotted walking naked on a street with his mouth, chest and abdomen covered in blood."

She was above the age of consent and agreed to perform the act, but Annis Abdullah, 27, of the Police Coast Guard, landed in court because oral sex is against the law... veteran criminal lawyer Subhas Anandan explained: 'The act by itself is an offence. It is not a question of consent or no consent. Even between consenting people, it is an offence.' Technically, he said, a woman who performs the act can also be charged with helping to commit a crime, but he was not aware of any such case... The maximum punishment for the offence is life imprisonment."

"<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/crime/criminals/guy-fawkes/">Guy Fawkes</a> could have changed the face of London if his 1605 plot had not been foiled, explosion experts have said. His 2,500 kg of gunpowder could have caused chaos and devastation over a 490-metre radius, they have calculated. Fawkes' planned blast was powerful enough to destroy Westminster Hall and the Abbey, with streets as far as Whitehall suffering damage... In a report published in the <i>New Civil Engineer</i>, Dr Alford calculated that Fawkes and his fellow conspirators went for an overkill, filling the cellar beneath the House of Lords with 25 times the explosive necessary to bring the building down."

"A sex aid has caused a bomb scare at a South African rubbish dump, the <i>Cape Times</i> says. A group of women searching for items for recycling heard a ticking sound coming from a rubbish bag. Thinking it could be a bomb, they informed the manager of the Hermanus dump in Cape Town, Adolf Hansen. 'I thought I would just tear the bag open a bit, and then there I saw what it was - a vibrator, the batteries still working.' ... He recognised what it was immediately, he said, because he had seen vibrators 'more than once' before. This one, he said, was 'middle-sized.'

"McDonald's says it deserves a break from the unflattering way the latest <i>Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</i> depicts its job opportunities. Among some 10,000 new additions to an updated version released in June was the term 'McJob,' defined as 'low paying and dead-end work.' In an open letter to Merriam-Webster, McDonald's CEO Jim Cantalupo said the term is 'an inaccurate description of restaurant employment' and 'a slap in the face to the 12 million men and women' who work in the restaurant industry." [<i>Tough shit, pal. It's been in the lexicon for years. Anyway, if the U.S. Postal Service can endure</i> "snailmail" <i>you can certainly live with</i> "McJob."]

"The spacecraft Voyager 1 is still sending data back to NASA, the U.S. government space agency, after more than 26 years in space. It is now the most distant man-made object in space, traveling billions of kilometers from earth and perhaps reaching the outer edges of our solar system... There is no conclusion on whether or not Voyager has actually passed the so-called 'Termination Shock,' where the spacecraft would encounter a dramatic drop in solar wind speed and an increase in interstellar plasma or particles... [regardless] scientists are gathering data from truly unknown territory and are scratching their heads over numbers being sent from a spacecraft that should have died 20 years ago."
