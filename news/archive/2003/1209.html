"Kenyan police have arrested a man who allegedly killed his one-year-old nephew, and ate part of his head. The 45-year-old man was sipping blood from the infant's head when he was restrained by neighbours, police say... Koibatek police chief, Maurice Kiplagat, told BBC News Online that the man has confessed to killing the boy and has no history of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/death/cannibalism/">cannibalism</a>... After a heated dispute, he picked up the boy and cut off his head with a machete, forcing his sister to flee the home, said Senior Superintendent Kiplagat. The man then started boiling the head as soup and was later apprehended by villagers, while quietly seated in the kitchen waiting for the soup to boil, the police chief said."

"Ignacio Jesse Sanchez, 23, charged with first-degree murder in connection with the death of 26-month-old Evangelina Azteca Atencio Leija, told officers he was potty-training and disciplining the toddler at the time of her fatal injuries, police said. But Boise Police Chief Don Pierce said Sanchez beat the toddler severely, and evidence shows that the beatings had been going on for at least two weeks - repeated abuse that Pierce described as 'torture.' ... Ada County Coroner Erwin Sonnenberg completed an autopsy Monday. He said the toddler died from blunt force trauma to the head, and suffered a skull fracture and a massive cerebral hemorrhage. The toddler also had multiple bruises in the the abdomenal area, he said. 'This is one of the worst child (death) cases I have ever seen.'"

"Police want the home-made road spikes, made from housing nails, plumbing tube and butter knives - to be added to the list of prohibited articles or have them categorised as an offensive weapon... The home-made road spikes had up to 16 long housing nails driven through a section of thin, plastic plumbing tube 1.5-metres long. To ensure the sharp end of the nails remained upright, two blunt kitchen knives were taped to each end of the tube...

"A new Special Forces group, designated Task Force 121, has been assembled from Army Delta Force members, Navy seals, and <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/conspiracy/cia/">C.I.A.</a> paramilitary operatives, with many additional personnel ordered to report by January. Its highest priority is the neutralization of the Baathist insurgents, by capture or <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/assassination/">assassination</a>... Inside the Pentagon, it is now understood that simply bringing in or killing <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam Hussein</a> and his immediate circle - those who appeared in the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> Administration's famed 'deck of cards' - will not stop the insurgency. The new Special Forces operation is aimed instead at the broad middle of the Baathist underground. But many of the officials I spoke to were skeptical of the Administration's plans. Many of them fear that the proposed operation - called 'preemptive manhunting' by one Pentagon adviser - has the potential to turn into another Phoenix Program. Phoenix was the code name for a counter-insurgency program that the U.S. adopted during the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/vietnam/">Vietnam War</a>, in which Special Forces teams were sent out to capture or assassinate Vietnamese believed to be working with or sympathetic to the Vietcong."

'After consulting with legal counsel and advisers, the governor has concluded that it would be fruitless to carry through with an investigation, as this issue has become far too political,' [Schwarzenegger spokesman Rob Stutzman] said... In an Oct. 5 interview with NBC anchor Tom Brokaw, he declined to answer specific questions about the charges. He said he would 'get into all of those kind of specifics' once the campaign was over. After the election, however, the new governor called the women's claims 'old news.'"

He tied the youths to what he called the 'intelligent hobbyhorse' - a noodle processing instrument in his house and suffocated them to death with a piece of cloth. Over the past two years, Huang had kidnapped and murdered 17 high school students and injured one. His crime was not even detected by local police until last month, when the 18th victim, also a schoolboy, escaped from Huang's home with wounds and reported to the police."

"More than a month before <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/death/suicide/suicide-bombers/">suicide bombers</a> blew up Italian military headquarters in the southern Iraqi city of Nasiriyah on Nov. 12, Italian intelligence officers warned three times of an imminent attack on their country's contingent in the city, according to intelligence reports. The warnings were communicated up the Italian chain of command but resulted in no new security precautions at the headquarters, Western sources said. The Italian government has denied receiving specific warnings of an impending attack."

"Alan Alda had nothing against hard-boiled eggs until last spring. Then the actor, better known as Hawkeye from <i>M*A*S*H</i>, paid a visit to the University of California, Irvine... By the time he came to leave, he had developed a dislike of hard-boiled eggs based on a memory of having made himself sick on them as a child - something that never happened... [UCI psychologist Elizabeth Loftus] has persuaded people to adopt false but plausible memories - for instance, that at the age of five or six they had the distressing experience of being lost in a shopping mall - as well as implausible ones: memories of witnessing demonic possession, or an encounter with Bugs Bunny at <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/travel/disneyland/">Disneyland</a>."

"A New Zealand man who built a cruise missile in his garage claims the New Zealand government forced him to shut down his project after coming under pressure from the United States. Bruce Simpson says he built the missile using parts bought off the internet to show how easily it could be done... 'The New Zealand government at first said I had done nothing illegal. But then a US official was quoted as saying it was "extremely unhelpful,"' Mr Simpson told BBC News Online."

"SCO Group's stock fell 8 percent Monday after a federal judge ordered it to produce evidence supporting its claim that IBM's version of the Linux operating system infringed on the Utah company's rights. U.S. Magistrate Judge Brooke Wells gave the Lindon company until Jan. 23 to show where and how IBM's freely distributed Linux code misappropriated SCO's proprietary Unix code. The charge is fundamental to SCO's March lawsuit against IBM seeking up to $50 billion in damages... SCO spokesman Blake Stowell said, 'We definitely will provide that within the next 30 days, as the judge requested.'" [<i>This should be fun.</i>]

"Henry Thomas Buckner, 27, of Middleburg, died after getting a four-inch bream stuck in his throat. His stepfather and two friends were fishing on the Ocklawaha River when they noticed Buckner bleeding from the mouth. 'No one saw him put the fish in his mouth,' Capt. Keith Riddick of the Putnam County Sheriff's Office said Monday. 'They heard gurgling, turned toward him and saw him bleeding from the mouth and the fish sticking out.' The men could not remove the fish and Buckner was pronounced dead at Putnam Community Medical Center on Oct. 19."
