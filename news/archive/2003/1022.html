somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"North Korea has been accused of killing the babies of women who are forcibly repatriated from China. Kept in short-term detention camps, the women are either given abortions or their babies are killed at birth, according to a report by the US Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (CHRNK)... One woman told of being forced to assist injection-induced labours and then watching as a baby was suffocated with a wet towel in front of its mother. Many former prisoners told of babies buried alive or left face down on the ground to die. They were told by guards this was to prevent the survival of half-Chinese babies." Plus, torture techniques.

"A man accused of beheading three children said his wife told him to kill them because they were evil, according to a statement read Tuesday at his capital murder trial. 'My daughter started to speak like my grandmother who had passed away... She told me that she had taken Julissa's soul,' John Allen Rubio said in the statement he made to police a day after the children's bodies were found. 'Julissa started to laugh and was making growls at me... My wife told me to kill the children because they were evil.' Rubio, 23, is accused of murdering and decapitating the children, ages 2 months to 3 years, on March 11. Angela Camacho, a Mexican citizen, is accused of helping her husband in the slayings."

"The buxom blonde, who suffers from hepatitis C, has told <i>Us Weekly</i> that she expects the virus to kill her--possibly within the next decade. 'I think I got a good 10 years left in me, which is sad, too,' Anderson says in the magazine. 'Maybe 15, if I'm lucky.' ... Anderson blames her infection on ex-hubby, Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, who she says passed the virus to her through shared tattoo needles... Anderson, never one to pursue the traditional route, has shied away from taking interferon, the drug many hepatitis patients use to battle the virus. The drug requires frequent injections for months at a time, and can cause flu-like side effects. Instead the actress has been using <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/medicine/homeopathy/">homeopathic</a> methods to treat the hepatitis." [<i>Good luck with that nonsense.</i>]

The students are protesting efforts by Diebold to prevent them and other website owners from linking to some 15,000 internal company memos that reveal the company was aware of security flaws in its e-voting software for years but sold the faulty systems to states anyway. The memos were leaked to voting activists and journalists by a hacker who broke into an insecure Diebold FTP server in March... The Diebold memos contain a trove of information about the internal workings of the electronic voting machine manufacturer, which has been criticized for poor programming practices."

"A woman in Pakistan doing cut-rate clerical work for UCSF Medical Center threatened to post patients' confidential files on the Internet unless she was paid more money. To show she was serious, the woman sent UCSF an e-mail earlier this month with actual patients' records attached. The violation of medical privacy - apparently the first of its kind - highlights the danger of 'offshoring' work that involves sensitive materials, an increasing trend among budget-conscious U.S. companies and institutions... In the case of the threat to release UCSF patient records online, a chain of three different subcontractors was used. UCSF and its original contractor, Sausalito's Transcription Stat, say they had no knowledge that the work eventually would find its way abroad. The Pakistani woman's threat was withdrawn only after she received hundreds of dollars from another person indirectly caught up in the extortion attempt."
