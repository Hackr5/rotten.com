"Pygmy activists from Congo are demanding that the United Nations set up a tribunal to try government and rebel fighters accused of slaughtering and eating Pygmies during fighting in the northeastern corner of the country. Army, rebel and tribal fighters -- some believing the Pygmies are less than human or that eating their flesh would give them magic power -- have been pursuing them in forests, killing them and eating their flesh, the activists told a news conference Wednesday.

...

'In living memory, we have seen cruelty, massacres, genocide, but we have never seen human beings hunted and eaten literally as though they were game animals, as has recently happened,' said Sinafasi Makelo, a representative of the Mbuti Pygmies in Congo.

...

Earlier this year, human rights activists and U.N. investigators confirmed that tribal fighters and members of one rebel group killed, cooked and ate at least a dozen Pygmies and an undetermined number of people from other tribes during fighting with rival insurgents."

"A small sample of Afghan civilians have shown 'astonishing' levels of uranium in their urine, an independent scientist says. 

...

The UMRC says its team identified several hundred people suffering from illnesses and conditions similar to those of Gulf veterans, probably because they had inhaled uranium dust. 

...

To test its hypothesis that some form of uranium weapon had been used, the UMRC sent urine specimens from 17 Afghans for analysis at an independent UK laboratory. 

It says: 'Without exception, every person donating urine specimens tested positive for uranium internal contamination. The results were astounding: the donors presented concentrations of toxic and radioactive uranium isotopes between 100 and 400 times greater than in the Gulf veterans tested in 1999.'"

Back at the other location, men were seen leaving the parking lot. Within minutes, they had arrived at the alleged lookout point. Then, what appeared to be an exchange of money with the lookout took place. The out-door brothel appeared to be open for business.

Next a young woman, dressed in a mini-skirt, was seen carrying a blanket and leading a man to the spot. And in plain view, Garcia and Castro witnessed several sex acts.

From a recent discussion in the UK House of Lords: "These statistics on accidents are extremely fascinating; they prove that the British public can use practically anything in this world to hurt themselves with. It is understandable that there are an estimated 55 accidents a year from putty, while toothpaste accounts for 73. However, it is rather bizarre that 823 accidents are estimated to be the result of letters and envelopes."

"Common fire ants are believed to be responsible for the death of a 3-month-old baby, who was stung hundreds of times while napping in a crib. Arizona Department of Agriculture entomologists identified the Southern fire ants from traps recovered Wednesday outside the southwest Phoenix home where Autumn White was stung Monday. Detectives are still unsure why the ants were drawn to the girl. ... Stanley Faeth, an Arizona State University professor, said swarming is abnormal for Southern fire ants, but Monday's attack may have been 'defensive.'"

"A 52-year-old man bitten by a rattlesnake, instead of calling for help on his cellular telephone with a fire station just a mile away, drove to a hospital about 16 miles away that transferred him to another hospital where he later died, authorities said Wednesday. Ross Cooke, of Norco, was walking through a dry wash in Lytle Creek last week when he stepped on a rattlesnake, which bit him twice on the lower left leg, said Randy Emon, San Bernardino County coroner's spokesman. Cooke walked about 500 yards to his car and used his phone to call his wife. After speaking with her Friday, he called his boss at a refrigeration company, who then told him to drive to Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Fontana, about 16 miles away."

DCF officials say Ricardo Bell, 26, used 'poor judgment.' He was arrested on a traffic violation charge Sunday and freed Monday on $500 bail. Bell was hired in December and was training to become a child protective investigator."
