"Three brothers hacked their two sisters to death in Jordan in an 'honour killing,' one day after parliament rejected tougher sentences for such crime, officials are quoted as saying. The unidentified sisters, aged 20 and 27, were killed with axes in the capital Amman on Monday, according to a report in the <i>Jordan Times</i> newspaper. ... The 27-year-old left her family home nearly two years ago to marry a man without her family's consent, the paper says. Her 20-year-old sister ran away three months ago to join her. Tipped on their whereabouts, the brothers went to their home with axes, and hacked their sisters to death, the paper says. ... Under the existing law, people found guilty of committing honour killings often receive sentences as light as six months in prison."

"In the two years since law enforcement agencies gained fresh powers to help them track down and punish terrorists, police and prosecutors have increasingly turned the force of the new laws not on <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda/">al-Qaida</a> cells, but on people charged with common crimes. ... Civil liberties and legal defense groups are bothered by the string of cases, and say the government soon will be routinely using harsh anti-terrorism laws against run-of-the-mill lawbreakers. 'Within six months of passing the Patriot Act, the Justice Department was conducting seminars on how to stretch the new wiretapping provisions to extend them beyond terror cases,' said Dan Dodson, a spokesman for the National Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys. 'They say they want the Patriot Act to fight terrorism, then, within six months, they are teaching their people how to use it on ordinary citizens.'"

Panayiotis Zavos, who runs a fertility laboratory in the US, made the hybrid embryos by inserting human DNA into the eggs of a cow. Professor Zavos said the human-cow embryos were 'theoretically viable' but emphasised that he had no plans to allow such a hybrid to be born. 'We are not trying to create monsters,' he said, claiming his aim was to perfect his cloning techniques without the ethical problems involved in the use of human egg cells."

"British scientists have shown in a controlled experiment that the extreme bass sound known as infrasound produces a range of bizarre effects in people including anxiety, extreme sorrow and chills -- supporting popular suggestions of a link between infrasound and strange sensations. 'Normally you can't hear it,' Dr Richard Lord, an acoustic scientist at the National Physical Laboratory in England who worked on the project, said Monday. ... 'These results suggest that low frequency sound can cause people to have unusual experiences even though they cannot consciously detect infrasound,' said Wiseman, who presented his findings to the British Association science conference. Infrasound is also produced by storms, seasonal winds and weather patterns and some types of earthquakes. Animals such as elephants also use infrasound to communicate over long distances or as weapons to repel foes."

"Until now, doctors and parents believed infants could not smile until weeks after birth. But leading obstetrician Professor Stuart Campbell has pioneered groundbreaking techniques which demonstrate otherwise. He said: 'It is remarkable a baby does not smile for about six weeks after birth. Before birth, most babies smile frequently.' The images are made using 4D ultrasound, which records echoes from the mother's womb and stores them digitally. ... Anti-<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/death/abortion/">abortionists</a> are likely to seize on the advance as new evidence against the case for terminations, which can be legally done at 24 weeks. ... one consultant obstetrician, Maggie Blott, was unconvinced by the 'smiling' images. She said: 'It looks like these babies are making smiling movements, but I think they are just using their facial muscles.'

'I hate nuns and want nothing to do with them. I suffered at their hands and don't want any other nuns near me.' ... She was regularly beaten for minor transgressions, left to sleep in her own <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/medicine/bodily-functions/pissing/">urine</a> when she wet the bed, had her teeth knocked out during one assault and was hospitalised following a severe beating at 13 when she and a friend attempted to break out of the orphanage."

The mother of Kaya Kemp, 12, said the girl was showing off the 2-week-old cat to friends when the kitten escaped from her box. A man picked the cat up and 'put her head in his mouth. He bit down and blood spurted everywhere,' the woman told the <i>Sun</i>... The man then ran off with the body of the kitten."

"When District Attorney Robert M. Carney cleaned out an evidence locker in the county courthouse, he found the expected flotsam and jetsam of prosecutions: old legal files, murder weapons, blood samples and confiscated drugs. He also unearthed an old controversy: a copy of <i>Deep Throat</i>, a groundbreaking adult movie seized from a State Street theater 30 years ago in an anti-obscenity crusade. ... Released in 1972, <i>Deep Throat</i> was a cultural sensation. In an era of sexual experimentation, it was one of the first adult films to achieve wide-scale popularity as people discarded the shame of association with smut and packed movie houses. Made on a shoestring budget, the film grossed $600 million and made its star, <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/actors/linda-lovelace/">Linda Lovelace</a>, an unlikely celebrity. Lovelace, who later said she was forced to appear in the film and became a leading critic of the porn business, died last year after a car crash."

Researchers in the United States based their findings on a study of 324 lesbians living in California.

"The Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office told 7NEWS it was trying to evict an elderly woman from a foreclosed home when they went inside and discovered dozens of buckets filled with what is believed to be human waste. The deputies carted the buckets and piles and piles of junk items, such as old furniture and garbage, out of the woman's home Monday night and left it out in the front yard. ... Some of the woman's neighbors said that because she did not have running water in her condo unit, she was forced to use an orange ice bucket and other containers as makeshift latrines. Another neighbor said that a detective told him that the woman explained that God told her to collect <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/medicine/bodily-functions/pissing/">urine</a> and feces."
