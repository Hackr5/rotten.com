According to the <i>Washington Times</i>, it 'may also charge him later with the more serious charge of treason, which under the Uniform Code of Military Justice could be punished by a maximum sentence of life' in prison. ... Capt. Yee was assigned to minister to <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda/">Al Qaeda</a>, Taliban and other enemy combatants incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. ... When he was arrested, he was reportedly carrying classified documents, including diagrams of the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/crime/prison/camp-x-ray/">facilities</a> in which the prisoners are being held.  He may also have been facilitating communications between the detainees and perhaps fellow terrorists still at large in ways that could undermine U.S. efforts to interrogate the former and counter the latter."

"A little-publicized privacy bill signed into law Monday aims to protect California motorists from a little-known device dubbed the 'black box' that records data on how a vehicle was being driven just before an accident. The legislation, the first of its kind in the nation, prevents the recorded data from being obtained by police or others without the vehicle owner's consent or a court order -- except in cases of safety research in which the owner's identity is protected. The law, which takes effect July 1, 2004, also requires automakers to disclose the presence of the devices in the owner's manual. ... General Motors -- the main user of the devices -- began installing the boxes in some cars as early as the 1970s, said O'Neill, and now installs them in every new car. Ford also installs recorders in some of its vehicles, he said, but most other automakers don't yet use them."

"More than 17 per cent of Australians are involved in gay or lesbian relationships, putting the country equal first in the world for its proportion of homosexuals, according to a new worldwide survey. ... At the other end of the scale, Vietnam recorded the lowest proportion of gay and lesbian relationships, at three per cent."

"Customs such as polygamy and overdependence on cattle as a pillar around which all economic activity revolves are making the Himba particularly vulnerable to HIV/Aids. The Himba culture also encourages older men who are rich in cattle to monopolise the women -- many of the men marry several young girls whose offspring help in the important task of raising cattle. ... The Himba culture also allows loose sex -- an old uncle will readily offer one of his many wives to a nephew during visits. This has contributed to the spread of HIV/Aids among the Himba -- who lead a pastoralist life in north-western Namibia."

"eBay is willing to hand over everything it knows about visitors to its Web site that might be of interest to an investigator. All they have to do is ask. ... 'When someone uses our site and clicks on the "I Agree" button, it is as if he agrees to let us submit all of his data to the legal authorities. Which means that if you are a law-enforcement officer, all you have to do is send us a fax with a request for information, and ask about the person behind the seller's identity number, and we will provide you with his name, address, sales history and other details -- <i>all without having to produce a court order.</i> We want law enforcement people to spend time on our site,' he adds. He says he receives about 200 such requests a month, most of them unofficial requests in the form of an email or fax."
