"A $2 million lawsuit has been filed in Blount County Circuit Court against a Blount County church, the pastor, the youth director, two deacons and several other church members. ... The suit alleges that group members were blindfolded and handcuffed with Velcro, 'dragged out' to the parking lot and told to climb in the back of a truck. According to the suit, Janie Doe fought back and pleaded to be let go but was laughed and yelled at by one of her alleged captors. ... When Janie Doe refused to deny Christ, the suit says there was the sound of a gunshot and she was soaked with water, then she began 'screaming and crying' before being told to go inside the residence of another church member." And that's just for starters.

"A senior strategist of the opposition Conservative Party has revealed that he leads a double life as Britain's foremost organiser of upmarket sex parties. By day, Dougie Smith, 41, is the respectable co-ordinator of Conservatives for Change (Cchange), an influential Tory think tank. But by night, Mr Smith runs Fever Parties, a London-based organisation that hosts 'five-star' orgies for swingers. ... Mr Smith confirmed that for five years he had been bringing together a fashionable London set of professionals for sex parties in Mayfair townhouses and country mansions. ... 'I have never made a secret about the fact that I run both Cchange and Fever,' he said. 'The two things don't overlap and therefore do not pose a problem. Fortunately, we're living in the 21st century, and even naturally censorious people tend to feel slightly self-conscious about wagging their fingers at what consenting adults do behind closed doors.'"

"Nicholas Muton climbed onto the M1 with a noose around his neck, smoking cigarettes and swearing at police officers who tried to coax him down. A woman missed spending a final day with her terminally ill mother and a three-week-old baby had to be airlifted out of the traffic chaos during the incident which gridlocked the motorway.  ... By 1130 BST he had climbed on to the motorway bridge on the A47 with a packet of cigarettes, a lighter, a mobile phone and a bottle of water. He said he was planning to commit suicide but changed his mind when he was on the bridge."

"An American Predator drone aircraft firing Hellfire missiles destroyed a convoy last week that was believed to be carrying fugitive Iraqi leaders, and experts are trying to determine whether those killed might have included Saddam Hussein or his sons." Once again, acting with no real proof, U.S. officials have attacked and killed a large number of Iraqis that were posing no immediate threat to anyone. "American officials...on the condition of anonymity said the United States had never been certain that Mr. Hussein or his sons were in the convoy." This is getting more ridiculous by the day!
