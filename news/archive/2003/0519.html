<b>Viewership</b><br>
On the first full day this page went live, 100,000 people visited this Rotten
News page. Of course that was the day after the WTC attacks, so that number is
somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"The Pentagon is developing a radar-based device that can identify people by the way they walk, for use in a new antiterrorist surveillance system. ... If the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, orders a prototype, the individual 'gait signatures' of people could become part of the data to be linked together in a vast surveillance system the Pentagon agency calls Total Information Awareness. That system already has raised privacy alarms on both ends of the political spectrum, and Congress in February barred its use against American citizens without further congressional review." No doubt the system will be capable of distinguishing between American walking styles and that of foreigners.

He earlier told the court: 'I realised that I was committing a crime by strangling my children and I also put a cracker in my mouth, which exploded and caused serious injuries.

Dr. Steven J. Hatfill suffered a bruised foot and abrasions after the incident Saturday... Shortly before 4:30 p.m., Hatfill's car pulled into a parking spot on the street and Hatfill got out with a camera to take photos of those trailing him. Hatfill told officers the driver of the green SUV 'had been recording his movements all day when he decided to take a picture back,' according to the police report.

There will be fine linen, candlelight and a sit-down meal. He's much like any other smitten groom -- but with a twist that has exposed stark, sometimes ugly divisions among equally passionate Canadians on both sides. 
Cook wants to marry another man. He and his groom, Murray Warren, hope to tie the knot at the stroke of midnight July 12, 2004. That's the deadline by which Ottawa has been court-ordered to change a law that bars same-sex couples from the altar."

"Frederick R. James had a plan to make some money while he was on trial in a Downstate federal court for selling a large amount of marijuana. James, who argued, according to his religious beliefs, that his name was copyrighted, decided to charge everyone in court each time his name was used. The judge's bill alone, sent to his home, came to $151 million -- or $500,000 per use by the judge of James' name. ... At trial, James argued that his ancestors came from Africa, that he is a Moorish national and only has to follow the laws mentioned in an old treaty between the United States and Morocco. James isn't alone in his beliefs; they are shared by other adherents to an Islamic sect called the Moorish Science Temple."

"A 4-year-old Broadmoor Bluffs girl died after her 2-year-old brother put the family vehicle in gear and backed over her as she played in their driveway. Police said Adreanna Cook was standing behind the 2001 GMC Yukon as her mother washed the vehicle around 5:15 p.m Saturday. The vehicle was parked on a steep incline, and the ignition was on so the girl's mother could listen to the radio as she cleaned the truck."

"Justices rejected an appeal from a school district that wanted the court to allow it to bar redneck attire. It was a victory for a New Jersey teenager suspended for wearing a T-shirt he bought at a <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/">Wal-Mart</a> store. ... Officials in the district in rural Warren County, N.J., claimed Sypniewki's shirt, featuring jokes of comedian Jeff Foxworthy, violated an anti-harassment and intimidation policy enacted because of racial tension at the high school. Sypniewski was suspended for three days for wearing the shirt that bore comedian Foxworthy's 'Top 10 Reasons You Might Be a Redneck Sports Fan.' Among them: 'you wear a baseball cap to bed,' and 'you know the Hooter's menu by heart'."

"A 10-year-old girl apparently killed herself Monday morning by jumping from the top of a multistory Tokyo apartment building, police said. The unnamed girl left her home in the apartment just minutes before a passerby saw a person falling from the 10-story building in Koto-ku and raised the alarm. Her mother was devastated. 'She left home slightly later than usual but she was smiling at the time. I can't think of any reason why she had to take her own life,' the mother said."

Because the mere presence of spectators at a competitive event is likely to cause embarrassment, "[p]arents have been banned from attending a school sports day." Said one disappointed parent: "Children don't become scarred for life because they lose the egg and spoon race." Bear in mind we're talking about England here.

After 18-month-old David Macrelli died of a severe vaccine reaction, the hospital got into trouble for harvesting the toddler's organs without parental approval. So now they're suing the hospital. Fair enough. The mother gave a couple of soundbites to the news crews: "Our son David was all heart, and he was buried without that heart. ... He isn't resting in peace. He's resting in pieces." Not to be left out, the father had one of his own: "Our son was buried twice. He's buried in two caskets." Nicely done.
