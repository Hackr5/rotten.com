Maddison, an RAF engineer from County Durham, had been used as a human guinea pig by MoD scientists experimenting on the lethal nerve gas sarin. Like hundreds of others from the armed forces, Maddison had volunteered for the trials, believing he was going to Porton Down to take part in some 'mild' experiments to find a cure for the common cold. Instead, by dropping sarin onto Maddison's skin, they used him to help determine the dosage of the lethal <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/wmd/nerve-agents/">nerve agents</a>. ... 'I had never seen anyone die before and what that lad went through was absolutely horrific... it was awful,' he said. 'It was like he was being electrocuted, his whole body was convulsing. I have seen somebody suffer an epileptic fit, but you have never seen anything like what happened to that lad... the skin was vibrating and there was all this terrible stuff coming out of his mouth... it looked like frogspawn or tapioca.'"

The child suffered severe internal and head injuries as a result of the fall, police said. ... '(Banks) told us that she was bathing the child in the bathtub ... it reared up and went through the window,' Maj. James Carmody said. 'Our charge is that she deliberately threw a child out of a window.'"

"It was billed as the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/culture/gypsies/">Gypsy</a> wedding of the year. But the Saturday ceremony, launching a three-day party, got off to a bad start: The 12-year-old 'princess bride' -- daughter of a self-proclaimed king -- stormed out of the church in protest in front of 400 guests. <i>'Leave me alone!'</i> Ana Maria Cioaba screamed at reporters, swearing at them as she sought shelter in a nearby house. Her bridesmaids chanted slogans against the groom. She returned to the church minutes later and -- though she would hardly look at him -- was duly married off to her 15-year-old groom, a sign of the persistence of the ancient practice of child weddings in the Gypsy, or Roma, culture. ... After the ceremony, the bride stalked out and refused to look at the groom, who walked uncomfortably two steps behind."

"Madison fire officials are investigating a bizarre fire Friday at a historic house on the near West Side. ... When firefighters arrived shortly after 6 a.m. Friday following an internal alarm from the house, they couldn't find the source of the fire. Those who live in the home hampered the investigation, said fire department spokesman Jon Frank. ... It's unclear if the fire department will seek charges against the members of Sigma Phi fraternity, but Frank said the department 'is going to look into it.' ... The 12-foot by 20-foot room, used for meetings and other fraternity activities, was apparently added sometime after the house was built. The room contains candles, a podium and has church-style pews for seating. There is only one way into the room, which has no windows and is underneath the back yard."

"Police arrested a man Friday who used a catapult to launch paint-filled balloons at the plastic box that holds street illusionist David Blaine dangling near the River Thames. A 28-year-old man from London was charged with criminal damage after he fired several balloons filled with pink paint at Blaine's box from a nearby upper floor window, hitting his target at least once, police said. The alleged assault was the latest in string of attacks; the New York magician has been pelted with eggs, golf balls and insults as he attempts to live for 44 days in a glass box suspended by a crane near Tower Bridge. ... As well as attacks on his temporary home, the magician has had to endure people banging drums and baring their breasts or buttocks at him in an attempt to keep him awake at night."

"Slavercise will raise your heart rate but there isn't a treadmill in sight. Be very afraid -- and prepare to be whipped, slapped and intimidated into shape. Run by a famed New York City dominatrix, petite blonde Mistress Victoria, Slavercise is an aerobics class which truly enforces the mantra 'no pain, no gain' and has attracted several celebrity clients. Armed with a riding crop and clad in rubber, fishnet stockings and five-inch stiletto heels, 30-year-old Mistress Victoria puts 'slaves' through their paces in an S&M-inspired workout...

Rumsfeld</a> a 'psychopath' and a 'stupid man' on Saturday, denouncing him for predicting that the country's isolated communist regime will one day fall. Speaking before a group of U.S. and South Korean businessmen, Rumsfeld said last week that freedom will eventually come and 'light up that oppressed land with hope and with promise,' casting aside the dictatorship that has ruled the North for more than half a century. ... KCNA, North Korea's official news agency, said Saturday that Rumsfeld's 'outbursts ... cannot be construed (other) than a desperate shrill cry of a psychopath on his death bed.'"
