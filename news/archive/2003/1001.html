"An out-of-work Wall Street investment banker who was deeply in debt killed his 8-year-old son before taking his own life by crouching in front of a commuter train, authorities said. Richard Josephs, 53, of Short Hills was struck and killed by a train Monday afternoon. His son, Eric, was found dead at the family's home. Authorities would not elaborate on how or why the son was killed. A New Jersey Transit spokeswoman said Josephs crouched on the tracks as the train approached, ignoring the whistle. The engineer applied the emergency brakes but was unable to avoid hitting him."

Roque, 44, had admitted to killing Balbir Singh Sodhi, 49, an Indian immigrant, but his attorney had said his client suffered from mental illness and heard voices. Deputy Maricopa County Attorney Vince Imbordino said during closing arguments that the shooting 'is not mental illness. It's hatred, it's anger.'

"Greek dog lovers accused the city of Athens on Wednesday of poisoning and burning more than 3,000 stray dogs this year to try to clean up streets before the 2004 Olympics. 'The dogs have been killed, poisoned, burnt and dumped in garbage bins in various areas of the capital,' Marianna Polichroniadou, head of a new citizens' pressure group which includes lawyers, actors and politicians, told a news conference. ... Polichroniadou said strays were killed in three waves this year -- before the Greek presidency of the European Union, during an EU summit in April and in August when people were away on holiday."
