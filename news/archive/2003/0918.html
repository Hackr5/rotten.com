somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

Inside, they spent two hours disconnecting two computers, which they put on trolleys and wheeled out of the room, past the security desk, into the lift and out of the building. The brazen theft has prompted Australia's top security agencies to conduct emergency damage audits amid fears that terrorists may have gained access to highly sensitive intelligence from the computers. ... The Australian Customs Service has admitted the security blunder, but told customs officers in an email that no sensitive operational information was lost. This brought angry rebuttals from customs officers who claimed that the two mainframe servers held thousands of confidential files, including top-secret communications between customs investigators and the AFP and ASIO."

"Police say a skateboarder being pulled by a sport-utility vehicle on an Albuquerque street died after he lost control and fell. ... police believe this specific incident was modeled after a stunt on the MTV show <i>Jackass</i>. Police say several teenagers were inside a Jeep Cherokee riving westbound on Comanche Wednesday night while two of their friends held onto the back of the Jeep while on skateboards. Witnesses tell police the jeep was traveling very quickly when Cornelius lost control and fell."
