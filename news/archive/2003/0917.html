"Damned if the doctors hadn't amputated Grandpa's right leg, just below the knee! They also whacked the five toes off his left foot. And they did it while Grandpa was deep in a month-long coma at Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital, near-fatal complications from what was supposed to be a routine heart procedure. ... An artery ruptured during the angioplasty, flooding his insides. To stop the blood flow, the doctors performed an emergency bypass. That produced serious clotting in his extremities and the real threat of gangrene, leaving the doctors with a terrible choice: Cut off Grandpa's leg -- or risk killing him."

"Attorney General <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/john-ashcroft/">John Ashcroft</a> denounced as 'hysteria' the contention by some librarians and civil liberties groups that the FBI can use a new anti-terror law to snoop into Americans' reading habits. ... Ashcroft said people are being wrongly led to believe that libraries have been 'surrounded by the FBI,' with agents 'dressed in raincoats, dark suits and sunglasses. They stop everyone and interrogate everyone like Joe Friday.'" [<i>Straw man fallacy.</i>]
