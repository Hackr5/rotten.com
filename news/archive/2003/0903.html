"A firecracker accident which left a 26-year-old man incontinent and unable to have sex has prompted warnings from police and health authorities about imitating stunts from the cult prankster film <i>Jackass</i>. It is not known whether the Illawarra man had been imitating <i>Jackass</i>, in which men place firecrackers in their buttocks and fire them into the air. ... The man suffered a fractured pelvis and severe burns to his genital area after a firecracker exploded between the cheeks of his buttocks. ... The man suffered extensive injuries from the explosion and required emergency surgery. He now has a colostomy and a catheter, and is sexually dysfunctional. ... <i>'I have seen instances ... where people have tried to remove items from their rectum and rupture the sphincter muscles, but not anything like this,'</i> [his surgeon] said."

"Scotland's most senior legal officer has asked for a report into whether a five-year prison sentence given to a man who raped an 13-month-old baby was 'unduly lenient.' Lord Advocate Colin Boyd QC's move follows anger at the sentence given to father-of-three James Taylor, who took pictures of himself raping the baby. Children's charities said they had expected Taylor to be jailed for life. ... Taylor, 43, was caught after police involved in an international anti-porn probe were tipped off that he had been posting child pornography on the internet."

"A teenage horror movie buff accused of chopping up his friend wrote a rap song about how he planned to do it, a court heard yesterday. Nikos Karagiannis had plotted on paper the murder of his only friend Ramis El Baba, according to evidence tendered in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court. <i>With every day going buy his or my hatred increases/ I'm going to kill a friend and chop him up in pieces,'</i> Mr Karagiannis wrote in a song shortly before Mr El Baba's death. The song, titled 'Revenge Rap,' also referred to throwing the dismembered body into a bay so nobody would find it. Police later found the lyrics in Mr Karagiannis' bedroom, along with a sketch of his friend with dotted lines showing how to carve up the body."

"Steven Keim, 23, was hit with several shotgun blasts about 11:30 p.m. Monday. The man, from Apple Creek in neighboring Wayne County, was declared dead at a hospital early this morning. Authorities said about 10 people ages 15 to 23 were throwing tomatoes and firing paintball guns at passing cars from a corn field on state Route 241 near Mount Hope. Members of the group told deputies that the driver of a luxury car stopped when a tomato hit it and threatened that he would shoot if it happened again. The driver then turned around, passed the group and was struck again with tomatoes. Deputies said the car returned about a half hour later, and the driver got out with a shotgun and started shooting." [<i>Obviously a rich mental case looking for an Old West showdown.</i>]

As it has expanded, the tone of the group has also shifted. Ms Harris, who was quoted in one of her first interviews as saying <i>'We don't allow dogs to breed. We spay them. We neuter them. We try to keep them from having unwanted puppies, and yet these women are literally having litters of children,'</i> has since toned down her language. ...

Customs officers at Holland's main airport opened a smelly suitcase to find it full of rotting baboon noses. The suitcase, which had come from Nigeria, was packed with up to 2,000 decaying noses in plastic bags. The bag had been left in storage at Schippol airport, Amsterdam, but attracted the attention of customs officers because of the smell, reports the NU news website. A customs spokesman said it was believed the noses were either intended for human consumption or to make medicine. In Dutch.

Being nonpartisan, they refrained from accusing the Vice President of this crime. But as their Report shows, they included evidence that makes the crime evident for all to see. They also provided evidence of what the motive for the crime was. The Report quietly -- but tellingly -- notes that the Vice President's team 'solicited input from, or received information and advice from nonfederal energy stakeholders, principally petroleum, coal, nuclear, natural gas, and electricity industry representatives and lobbyists.'"

"Newly released documents have revealed that oil billionaire and museum founder J. Paul Getty was a friend and admirer of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/nazi/adolf-hitler/">Adolf Hitler</a> and even lent his support to <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/nazi/">Nazi Germany</a> in the early days of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/wwii/">World War II</a>. ... Getty appears to have been at the center of a shadowy group of financiers that provided support to Nazi Germany in the early days of World War II. ... In 1939, Getty returned from a trip to Europe talking jauntily about his 'old friend' Hitler. But the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and America's subsequent entry into the war on the allied side seems to caused a change of heart. Getty became a patriotic American seemingly overnight."

"The way we fight viruses is fundamentally flawed, because viruses spread faster than antivirus patches can be distributed. By the time the antivirus software catches up, the damage has already been done, says Hewlett-Packard researcher Matthew Williamson. ... Williamson's research, due to be presented at a conference in Toronto later in September, is the first time anyone has analysed how effective this antivirus software is. ... He found that even if a signature is available from the moment a virus is released, it cannot stop the virus spreading if it propagates fast enough. 'These fast viruses are what we are getting at the moment,' Williamson says, adding that they are getting better at being quicker."

"<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/actors/arnold-schwarzenegger/">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, skipping the first debate of California's recall election, was egged Wednesday on a university campus... A thrown egg splattered on the back of his left shoulder as he waded through the crowd at California State University, Long Beach. An aide tried to wipe it off, but he simply peeled off his coat and went ahead with his speech."
