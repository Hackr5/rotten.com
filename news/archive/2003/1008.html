"Timothy Treadwell, 46, and girlfriend Amie Huguenard, 37, were killed and partially eaten by a bear or bears near Kaflia Bay, about 300 miles southwest of Anchorage, earlier this week... The fearless former drug addict from Malibu, Calif. -- who routinely eased up close to bears to chant <i>'I love you'</i> in a high-pitched, sing-song voice -- was the subject of a show on the Discovery Channel and a report on <i>Dateline NBC</i>... 'I told him to be much more cautious... because every time a bear kills somebody, there is a big increase in bearanoia and bears get killed,' Miller said. 'I thought that would be a way of getting to him, and his response was <i>"I would be honored to end up in bear scat."'</i> A number of other people said that over the years Treadwell made similar comments to them, implying that he would prefer to die as part of a bear's meal." [<i>Mission accomplished.</i>]

"Turncoat mob capo Anthony Rotondo told stunned jurors that one of the oldest members of New Jersey's DeCavalcante family, Carlo Corsentino - who lived to be more than 100 - came up with the idea of using 'double-decker' coffins at his funeral home in Elizabeth, N.J. 'The family would put the body of the murdered victim below the regular customer, thus disappearing forever,' Rotondo explained to prosecutor Michael McGovern. He said the heavy weight of the coffins often surprised pall bearers when they went to carry the remains of their loved ones. 'Everybody would kind of look at one another,' Rotondo recalled. 'There would be six grown men carrying someone's 80-pound grandmother, and they looked like they were having a problem.'"

On her application for compensation, Nina Tichelkamp-Russell, the mother of Jonathon Russell, said he suffered injuries and died on company time after the July 1 shootings at Modine Manufacturing Co... The application said Russell suffered injuries to his head and chest. One section of the standardized form asks for a description of what the employee was doing when his injuries occurred.

"Derren Brown's Russian roulette stunt backfired on him after police confirmed on Tuesday that the bullet loaded into his gun was a blank. Three million viewers watched Brown fire a gun, said to contain a live bullet, at his temple on Sunday night. But police in Jersey, where the stunt took place, said it was a fake. 'There was no live ammunition involved and at no time was anyone at risk,' said Lenny Harper, Detective Chief Officer for the States of Jersey police. 'A prop company brought a number of props to the island and they included a quantity of blank ammunition. There is absolutely no way that the State of Jersey police would allow anybody to put themselves at risk and shoot themselves dead.' ... Brown had claimed the stunt needed to be filmed at a secret foreign location to bypass Britain's strict gun laws - but the laws in Jersey are just as strict."

Orrin Hatch says <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/actors/arnold-schwarzenegger/">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> should not be judged on past improper advances towards women but as the devoted husband he is today, adding that the foreign-born GOP candidate for California governor also should have the opportunity to run for president under a constitutional amendment Hatch is pushing... Hatch has introduced a resolution to amend the Constitution's ban on non-American-born presidents by allowing people who have been U.S. citizens for at least 20 years to be elected to the White House. While the measure was not introduced with Schwarzenegger in mind, Hatch said the Austrian-born superstar would be a perfect example of why the constitutional amendment is needed. <i>If Arnold Schwarzenegger turns out to be <b>the greatest governor of California</b>, which I hope he will, if he turns out to be a tremendous leader and he proves to everybody in this country that he's totally dedicated to this country as an American... we would be wrong not to give him that opportunity,"</i> said Hatch."

"Defense Secretary <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/donald-rumsfeld/">Donald H. Rumsfeld</a> said yesterday that he was not told in advance about a reorganization of the Iraq reconstruction, which he heads. He said he still does not know the reason for the shake-up. Rumsfeld said in an interview with the <i>Financial Times</i> and three European news organizations that he did not learn of the new Iraq Stabilization Group until he received a classified memo about it from national security adviser <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/condoleeza-rice/">Condoleezza Rice</a> on Thursday. Rumsfeld was asked several times why the changes were necessary. 'I think you have to ask Condi that question,' he said... Pressed, he said: 'I said I don't know. Isn't that clear? You don't understand English? I was not there for the backgrounding.' Rumsfeld's tart remarks offer a window on the tensions among members of President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a>'s war cabinet."
