<b>Viewership</b><br>
On the first full day this page went live, 100,000 people visited this Rotten

somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"A butcher has slashed six people, including two children, with his knife after going on the rampage in a village in south-western France. Michel Perroy, in his late 40s, attacked people in Salleboeuf, near Bordeaux, apparently at random, as he ran shouting through the streets. ... 'It's the end of the world, we're all going to die,' he screamed. ... 'He was on the ground, covered in blood, saying "The Jehovah's Witnesses have said it's the end of the world,"' said one bystander. ... 'I don't understand it -- he was always ready to lend a hand, a truly good man," said one villager, Michele Dugarry, who had noticed nothing unusual when the butcher came into her cafe about an hour before the attack. However, Ms Dugarry added that he had said he spoken about getting rid of some Jehovah's Witnesses who had called on him."

"By the time he finished testifying, 38 people, 35 of them black, had been convicted of selling small amounts of cocaine and sentenced to prison for as long as 90 years. For this, [Thomas Roland Coleman] was named <i>Texas' outstanding narcotics officer</i> in 2000. ... The arrests accounted for about 10 percent of Tulia's black residents. ... Coleman is 'the most devious, nonresponsive witness this court has witnessed in 25 years on the bench in Texas,' the judge wrote. Coleman also was a bigot who used the 'n' word on the job, testimony showed. ... A threatened civil suit against Swisher County was dropped in exchange for a total settlement of $250,000 for the defendants."

"Prosecutors at the war crimes trial of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/slobodan-milosevic/">Slobodan Milosevic</a> may have produced the first document linking the former Yugoslav president to the massacre of thousands of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica, legal experts said Friday. The killing of 7,500 Muslims at the UN-protected enclave of Srebrenica in July 1995 was the worse massacre in Europe since <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/wwii/">World War II</a>.

Milosevic faces 66 counts of war crimes, including genocide for Srebrenica. He has denied knowledge or involvement in the killings. He has been on trial since February 2002 and is defending himself despite serious heart trouble and illness that has repeatedly delayed hearings.

"At the age of three, [John Ssaybunnya] witnessed his mother being murdered... Traumatised by the horror of what he had seen, he fled into the jungle. And there he should have died, but he didn't. He survived because he was adopted by a troupe of African Green monkeys who fed him and raised him as their own. ... Throughout the centuries there have always been tales of feral children which have grasped our imagination and fascinated us. From Romulus and Remus to Tarzan and Jane, and Mowgli of <i>The Jungle Book</i>, stories have abounded about children reared by animals." [<i>And what do all of these stories have in common?

Omar died around 10 p.m. of a ruptured appendix in front of the other youths in his unit. When the guards who work the early shift arrived the next morning, they were devastated. One guard who had become close to Omar screamed at supervisors that they had allowed the youth to die. 'I left here with 28 children. I come back to 27 and one dead,' he screamed."

"U.S. and Iraqi officials have confirmed the theft of at least 6,000 artifacts from Iraq's National Museum of Antiquities during a prolonged looting spree as U.S. forces entered Baghdad two months ago, a leading archaeologist said yesterday. ... The June 13 total was double the number of stolen items reported by Customs a week earlier, and Gibson suggested the final tally could be 'far, far worse.' ... It now appears, however, that although the losses were not nearly as grave as early reports indicated, they go far beyond the 33 items known to have been taken from the museum's display halls."

The legislation replaces the term 'sodomy' with 'criminal sexual act' and replaces 'deviate sexual intercourse' with 'oral sexual conduct' or 'anal sexual conduct.' ... Advocates contend that though the term sodomy is often associated with anal sex, most sodomy charges in New York involve oral sexual assaults by men against women."

"The camp is an effort of the American Association for Nude Recreation. The organization is tapping into the increasing popularity of clothing-optional activities and is sponsoring summer camps across the country for nudists aged 11 to 18. Parents say such venues promote a healthy body image for their children at an age when confidence can crumble. But there are critics. 'That (camp) sounds like a colossally bad idea,' said Marlo Archer, an Ahwatukee Foothills psychologist. Archer said a youngster's increasing awareness of sex combined with pubescent hormones and nudity make for a dangerous mix."
