"A driver less than two weeks on the job hauling Toronto's sewage to Michigan dumpsites was killed when his 70,000-pound (32-tonne) load spilled on him as he was emptying the massive truck into a landfill trench, police say. Jovan Sarovic, 38, of Kitchener, was knocked into the trench early yesterday by the tailgate of the truck in which he had transported biosolids produced by Toronto's Ashbridges Bay sewage treatment plant. The contents of the truck then poured out on him... Preliminary reports were that the tailgate of the truck flew open with such force that it knocked him into the trench and the load then came down on him."

Mahathir said Jews ruled the world and got others to fight and die for them, but added that they would not be able to defeat the world's 1.3 billion Muslims. <i>'We are actually very strong, 1.3 billion people cannot be simply wiped out. The Europeans killed 6 million Jews out of 12 million. But today the Jews rule the world by proxy.

"It is a big mistake to venture out at night if you are young, male and unmarried in the Indian state of Bihar. Subhash Kumar, a bank clerk in Patna, let his guard down and paid the price by being kidnapped. Four days after being carried off by a gang of thugs, manacled to a bed, starved and severely beaten, Kumar found himself married to a girl he had never seen before. His tears and offers to pay ransom led to beatings, at least until the nuptials were complete. During the marriage ceremony a rope was tied around Kumar's waist in case he disgraced the bride's family by trying to flee. But by then, the resistance had been beaten out of him. In those dark hours, all he wanted was for the nightmare to end, even if it meant being married to a complete stranger. The next day a sullen Kumar took his wife home, vowing vengeance against his in-laws. But, like thousands of similarly married Bihari grooms, he feared the kidnappers' vengeance. Unwilling to face more beatings, he resigned himself to marriage."

Robert Jay Renz, 27, was arrested Wednesday and charged with two felony counts of animal cruelty, according to Lee County sheriff's reports... Deputies went to Renz's home on Friday and Monday, both in reference to reports he was trying to kill himself. When they arrived Monday, they found blood on Renz's hands and arms and found a pickax and hatchet, which had hair on it matching the color of the dead dog, according to sheriff's reports."

"A French magistrate caught <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/sex/masturbation/">masturbating</a> during a court session was locked up on Thursday and put under investigation, justice officials in the south-western city of Bordeaux said... According to <i>La Charente Libre</i>, a local newspaper who had a reporter in court at the time of the alleged offence, the magistrate had discreetly lifted up his ceremonial robe while a lawyer was presenting final arguments, undid his pants and 'engaged in gestures that left nothing to the imagination.'"

"Ali Abbas, the 13-year-old Iraqi boy whose armless torso, horrific burns and haunted eyes came to symbolise all the brutality of the Iraq invasion, has been successfully fitted with artificial limbs... Ali sustained burns to a fifth of his body and was not expected to survive. Then, after four months in a Kuwaiti hospital, he was flown to England for specialist medical treatment. Understandably, his joy over his new arms is tempered by his anger over the bombing... <i>'I hoped the pilot who hit our house would be burned as I am burned and my family were burned.'"</i>

"In majority of countries, humans usually <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/medicine/bodily-functions/pissing/">urinate</a> at a toilet. Public toilets are often separate for men and women. Those for men often have also urinals. These may have partitions between them to avoid men being able to see the penises of other men. In contrast, the subcontinent has a peculiar culture which accepts public urniation. Men are seen urinating openly in public places without feeling any embarrasment... Maybe for a change we should allow public kissing of opposite sex in our culture, which is a much more scenic view than seeing somene urinating in front of you." [<i>To each his own.</i>]

"The world's largest study into the effects of prayer on patients undergoing heart surgery has found it appears to make no difference. The MANTRA study, run from Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina, involved 750 patients. Before their operations, they were randomly split into two groups, and half were prayed for by Christians, Jews, Buddhists and Muslims. However, checks revealed they had fared no better than those not prayed for."

"The Danish-born mother of Russia's last tsar Nicholas II is to make a final journey back to her adopted country, 80 years after her death. The Danish Foreign Ministry says the remains of the Empress-Dowager Maria Fedorovna are to be moved next year from Denmark to a cathedral in St Petersburg... Nicholas II and his wife and children were killed by a firing squad in the Siberian city of Yekaterinburg in 1918, about eight months after the Bolshevik revolution. Their remains were exhumed in 1991 and buried in the St Petersburg cathedral in 1998 after years of argument about their authenticity and several genetic tests."

"Hunters who bait bears with large blocks of candy are creating addicts with health problems ranging from tooth decay to lethargy, wildlife officials say... bears become addicted to the blocks, returning to the area even after the sugar is gone. Biologists found that addicted bears suffer from tooth decay, hair loss, weight loss and lethargy, said David Cobb, chief of the Wildlife Management Division of the Wildlife Resources Commission... a $15 block can be up to four feet square and five feet deep and made of bubble gum, chocolate, licorice and hard candy. Some weigh more than 2,000 pounds. Martin said many recent blocks have come from Hershey Foods in Pennsylvania... Cobb once found a bear lying down in the middle of the road, moaning and unwilling to move out of the vehicle's way. He compared the image to that of humans addicted to cocaine."

"The purple, small-headed creature with tiny eyes, protruding snout and a bloated appearance belongs to a new family of frogs that scientists thought had either never existed or had disappeared without trace millions of years ago. The frog has been named <i>nasikabatrachidae</i>, which is Sanskrit for frog with a nose... Its closest living relatives are a family frogs called <i>sooglossidae</i> that are found only in the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean, about 3000 kilometres from India. 'You could say it is a living fossil,' said Dr Bossuyt, referring to the new species." With photo.
