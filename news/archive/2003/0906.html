"Maintenance workers at Carver Park Estates watched in disbelief yesterday morning as a tenant dragged a naked and bloodied body from an apartment and laid it in the grass. The workers, standing just feet away, said the tenant looked at them, walked back into his apartment and returned seconds later with a mop. He cleaned up some blood left just outside his door, they said, then went inside again. 'He didn't care,' worker Willie Chaney said. 'He dragged the man outside in broad daylight.' ... [The suspect] had a reputation as a finicky tenant. He made regular requests for renovations, several said, and kept his apartment in pristine condition."

"About 30 cows had to be removed from a barn that authorities said was filled nearly floor to ceiling with manure. Marathon County sheriff's deputies and veterinarians spent Wednesday and Thursday at the site in the town of Holton. The sheriff's department began removing cattle from the barn Wednesday, digging through the manure looking for animals that were dead or alive, Capt. Randy Hillman said. One veterinarian found a steer on one end of the barn buried up to its head in cow manure, and it had to be euthanized, according to the sheriff department's report."

"A huge silo filled with treated human feces for use as fertilizer exploded early yesterday, sending an unpleasant wave of burnt fecal odor into the Hunts Point section of The Bronx. Officials at the New York Organic Fertilizer Company said the silo, which held about 650 tons of dried fertilizer pellets, exploded at around 6:30 a.m. after a computer indicated one of the tanks was overheating. Workers rushed to empty the silo, but pellet dust ignited inside the tank, causing what witnesses described as a huge explosion."

"A former state official and soccer dad has been charged with harassment and misdemeanor assault after he allegedly tackled, then pulled the shorts and underwear off an 11-year-boy at a soccer practice in Palmer in June. ... At first, Bailey said, he assumed it was a joke. But then he saw Weaver tackle the boy, strip off his clothes and throw them onto the grass a short distance away. The boy crawled over to retrieve his shorts and ran off into the woods using his clothes to cover himself, Bailey said. ... Weaver said in a telephone interview Thursday there was 'lots more' to tell about what happened but that he did not want to discuss it before his trial, scheduled for December. He said his actions were 'unusual in an unusual situation.'" [<i>More on this story in three months.</i>]

"An inmate can pursue his legal challenge to a Department of Correction policy preventing him from ordering or receiving pornographic materials depicting sexual penetration, the Indiana Court of Appeals ruled Thursday. ... The lawsuit was filed by Jerry Montgomery, an inmate at the State Prison in Michigan City. He was convicted of murder in Lake County in 1986 and sentenced to 40 years.  He said he was entitled to pornographic material based on a state law that says the DOC can inspect all printed matter and exclude any material that is contraband or prohibited property. 'However, in the case of a confined adult, the department may not exclude printed matter on the grounds that it is obscene or pornographic unless it is obscene under Indiana law,' the law says. Montgomery claims that under the statute, he is entitled to receive 'penetration pornographic material' that does not run afoul of Indiana obscenity laws."

"Being drunk on duty is one thing, but the Dutch government is concerned that too many of its police officers are getting stoned on and off duty... The government is under pressure to act after a television documentary revealed that senior officers in Amsterdam regularly used hard drugs and even dealt ecstasy and cocaine to colleagues. The investigation was launched after a detective saw a police brigadier popping ecstasy while on a stakeout. Witnesses described occasions when officers were so high on ecstasy that they could not even find Amsterdam's main shopping street, just two minutes away from the station."

Hoffine stepped out from behind a parked van Thursday afternoon and fired several shots at the boy, then reloaded his pistol and fired into the fallen boy's head as his teammates scrambled for cover, witnesses and police said. Hoffine then drove to a friend's home and spent nearly 10 hours in on-and-off negotiations with police before shooting himself in the head early Friday."

"Police discovered a home in deplorable conditions and four children hungry, hot and scared after their mother left them in their southeast Houston home alone. ... The oldest child -- a 5-year-old girl -- was left to care for the three younger children, according to officials. ... 'The officers reported that the house was in complete filth. There were insects crawling all over the floor ... just a general mess,' Davis said. ... Davis said two of the children suffered numerous insect bites. A pack of uncooked hot dogs were on the bed, and a loaf of bread and a bottle of Coke were underneath the bed. Officials said there were bite marks on the plastic wrapper of the hot dogs."

"Cops ordered to book as many motorists as they can twice told a schoolgirl who had been attacked: 'Can you come back later?' The shocked 15-year-old fought off a man who tried to force her into his rusty white car. She fled home and her parents took her to a police station in Caernarfon, North Wales. As she told of her nightmare ordeal an officer said: 'We're very busy. Can you come back later?' She and her stunned parents returned after an hour but were sent away again."

"The jury of one officer and three enlisted personnel will decide whether Funk is guilty of 'shirking important duty,' a charge that could lead to a year in prison. Funk has said the Marines are trying to make an example of him because he attended anti-war rallies and later made public that he is gay. In opening arguments Friday, defense attorney Stephen Collier said Funk's research and his attorney at the time led him to believe he would be removed from his unit when he declared himself a conscientious objector. But Marine prosecutor Maj. Mike Sayegh said that when Funk was contacted four days before a Feb. 13 deployment, he gave no indication that he was not going to show up. When he did arrive, it was with reporters and supporters in tow, Sayegh said."

"As Matschke walked past his car, Roelofse said to her: 'If you ever again touch my cat I will shoot you in your fucking poes.' Magele and Shapiro agreed with prosecutor Natasha Veldsmann that it was 'disgusting' for a man to use such language towards a 'decent' woman. Roelofse was found guilty of <i>crimen injuria</i> [criminal insult].  Matschke told the court the incident left her feeling disgusted and humiliated, as though she had been undressed and raped. 'I was horribly shocked and flabbergasted, as I didn't know him from a bar of soap.'"

"HIV may have been passed between two sisters who shared a razor to shave their legs, scientists said today. The report, in the journal <i>Aids</i>, is described as a 'sobering' reminder that the disease can be spread in unusual ways. In this case, an 18-year-old girl from Australia caught the disease on the first occasion she had sex. Her 16-year-old sister later tested positive for the virus when she donated blood."

"A former Precinct 3 deputy constable was convicted Thursday of trying to intimidate three garbage collectors by brandishing his semiautomatic rifle in front of them after their truck had blocked his way home. ... Prosecutor Ed Porter told the six jurors that Pascual became enraged at Harris County garbage collectors whose truck blocked the path to his Channelview home in the 1100 block of Heathfield. Porter said Pascual got out of his car and yelled at the men, flashing his badge and saying, 'I am the law.' When they arrived at Pascual's home moments later to pick up trash, Pascual came out to his driveway and loaded his semiautomatic AR-15 in the workers' view, Porter said."

He then walked out of the restroom and into the lobby, where he stood in front of a wall and exposed himself to everyone in the bank, arrest reports state. Whitney then went into a private kitchen area and lay on a couch, where he passed out naked, police said. When police tried to awake him, Whitney said: 'This is the bar. Go away,' arrest reports state."

"The trailer home formerly at 69 Copper Avenue was primed with 30 gallons of a gasoline/diesel mixture, so when firefighters cracked open two flares and tossed them in the windows the explosion of flames was instantaneous. The smoke detectors in the home went crazy but were silent within seconds, overwhelmed by the heat. ... The burning was the culmination of a month-and-a-half-long effort by Evansville, Natrona County and Health Department authorities to destroy the trailer. Funeral home workers first discovered the garbage, rodents and fecal waste in the home when they went to fetch the body of Judith Kasola, 38, who died July 14. ... Town Public Works Coordinator Ron Reed said burning the trailer did not pose a significant health hazard, aside from the flaming can of Spaghetti-O's that was ejected 75 feet from the trailer."
