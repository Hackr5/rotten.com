The book says the Soviet plots were cancelled after Stalin's death in 1953 by his successor Nikita Krushchev who was a fan of the larger-than-life star of more than 100 films."

"A passenger-screening system designed to help capture terrorists <i>could also be used to target people suspected of violent crimes</i>... The new proposal shows that officials intend to use the system -- potentially the largest surveillance network created by the government -- more broadly to keep dangerous people off planes. That could include people wanted for domestic terrorism or violent crimes. Anyone flagged by the system would receive extra screening or, in some circumstances, be detained. ... David L. Sobel, general counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said he worries that CAPPS II will become a 'massive enforcement mechanism.'

The decision to close down the national nuclear security administration advisory committee -- required by law to hold public hearings and issue public reports on nuclear weapons issues -- has come just days before a closed-door meeting at a US air force base in Nebraska to discuss the development of a new generation of tactical 'mini nukes' and 'bunker buster' bombs, as well as an eventual resumption of nuclear testing. ... The committee's charter said that its meetings 'will be held approximately four times each year.' In fact, it was not summoned at all in the last year of its existence."

"A couple allowed a relative who had been convicted of molesting their 10-year-old daughter to babysit the girl, police said. Police have charged the parents, who live in Hopewell, with endangering the welfare of a child for allowing Ronald E. Dodson, 53, of Saxton, to watch the girl two years after he was convicted of molesting her. ... Dodson, who is the father's uncle, was sentenced in 2001 to four years' probation and a $500 fine. He was still on probation when he allegedly molested the girl this spring."

"A three-year-old White River girl was locked in a cage while her grandparents allegedly sexually assaulted her and failed to provide for even her most basic needs, Mpumalanga police said on Wednesday. Visser said that when police went to investigate they found the girl had already been removed from the cage. However, she said there was evidence the child had been battered with sticks or other weapons and had been sexually assaulted. It also seemed the child had no clothes of her own and had to beg naked for food. She slept on bits of plastic in the cage."

"A Russian man paid the price for training his guard dog too well when the snarling animal held off paramedics long enough for him to die of heart failure. The ferocious Staffordshire bull terrier kept doctors at bay as they tried to approach the middle-aged patient Wednesday. 'Doctors and the man's wife tried to approach the man for a long time, but the dog was furious and would not allow it,' Andrei Rudomyotov, a regional police chief, said by telephone from the city of Chelyabinsk near the Ural mountains."

"Opponents of an AIDS memorial designed in the form of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl thought they had scored a victory when California Assembly members removed a line from the state budget that reappropriated $400,000 for the project. But through last-minute maneuvers, backers of the controversial plan managed to set aside the taxpayer money by shifting the project from the budget bill, passed Tuesday, to a trailer bill where it was buried at the bottom of a collection of unrelated items."

"Monsignor Timothy Verdon, on the staff at Florence's Duomo, or cathedral, held a news conference this week to denounce the lack of respect shown to that church. He decried the dozens of souvenir vendors outside the cathedral's exit and the messy trash cans in the piazza, 'which are already spilling over by midday.' Even worse, Verdon added, officials at several churches in Florence, a city renowned for grace and beauty, say that the areas around their churches have been transformed into 'open toilets.' 'There's always more and more bums and tourists sleeping outside,' Livi said in a telephone interview Wednesday. 'The tourists sit on the steps and leave all the crumbs.'"

"A Frenchman attempting to row across the Atlantic called his mother for help as he sat atop his capsized boat in rough waters 160km off Cape Cod, the head of the American Ocean Rowing Society said on Tuesday. Emmanuel Coindre, who set off for France from the coast of Massachusetts last week, capsized early on Monday due to inclement weather and used a satellite phone to call for help as the boat took in water. 'After five hours (trying to right the boat) he phoned his mother in France who called the French coast guard who called the US Coast Guard.'"

He said the party's members would 'continue to exist' as the 'lesbigay' league of the newly formed DPP. The DPP would campaign for the death penalty to be reinstalled. It would also campaign for the rights of criminals to be restricted and for rapists to be castrated."
