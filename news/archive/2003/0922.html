"Britain's estimated nine million domestic cats are being blamed by scientists for infecting up to half the population with a parasite that can alter people’s personalities. The figures emerge from studies into <i>toxoplasma gondii</i>, a parasite carried by almost all the UK's feline population and maybe elsewhere in the world. They show that half of Britain's human population carry the parasite in their brains, and that infected people may undergo slow but crucial changes in their behaviour. Infected men, suggests one new study, tend to become more aggressive, scruffy, antisocial and are less attractive. Women, on the other hand, appear to exhibit the 'sex kitten' effect, becoming less trustworthy, more desirable, fun-loving and possibly more promiscuous."

"The children of Lui scoop their beans and mush from plates laid out on the dirt, using only their tiny fingers, often aware that something bad is about to happen. Their necks begin to swing forward and back. 'Nodding disease,' as the malady has been called, takes hold. 'I don't feel good when I eat,' said Malesh Reuben, a skinny 12-year-old who has been nodding this way for five years. About 300 children in and around this jungle village in southern Sudan have the mysterious ailment. It typically strikes during or just after a meal. The neurological disorder has left epidemiologists baffled. ... Nodding is just one effect of the unusual malady. The children who begin nodding eventually stop growing when still small. Their brains stop developing as well, leaving victims mentally retarded. Eventually, the disease kills."

"A smuggling ring operated for several months in Ohio's largest Amish community, transporting hundreds of illegal immigrants from Mexico and Guatemala, investigators said. Three Guatemalan men admitted in federal court in recent weeks that they packed undocumented people in vans and hauled them to Ohio, where they sought work in Amish communities. For months, translators helped illegal immigrants lie on identification forms at the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles in Holmes County, prosecutors said. The State Highway Patrol began investigating when bureau employees became overwhelmed by the number of people seeking help."

Jury selection begins today in Plymouth Superior Court in Brockton in the first-degree murder trial of Zapp's alleged killer, 40-year-old Paul J. Leahy, a former Burger King employee. ... State Police Lieutenant Stephen O'Reilly, heading home from work, was in the men's room and heard shouting and scuffling. He entered the ladies' room and found Zapp's body in one of the stalls and Leahy washing blood from the knife he allegedly used in the killing. ... Leahy had previously been convicted of forcing a woman into the back room of a Brockton pizza shop and raping her. He served 13 years of a 15-year sentence before being released in 2000. One year later, he was convicted of accosting a minor and demanding oral sex and was jailed again. He was released on that charge in November 2001, eight months before he allegedly killed Zapp."

That's the assertion of Los Alamos and University of California investigators, who today cleared Anaya of any wrongdoing... Anaya received a request from the Lab's Engineering Sciences and Applications division for 20 transducers last April. So she phoned in an order to what she thought was the Fluid Conditioning Company in Phoenix. The company had moved, however. And its number now rang in the back office of All Mustang Performance, a Ford parts and accessories shop."

"The head of the Anti-Defamation League accused Mel Gibson yesterday of holding anti-Semitic beliefs based on the actor's response to criticism of his upcoming movie depicting <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/religion/jesus-christ/">Jesus</a>' death. ... Gibson, who is Catholic, has repeatedly denied that his movie <i>The Passion</i> maligns Jews. ... In <i>The New Yorker</i>, Gibson discussed how some Catholic theologians have been criticized for their depiction of Jews. <i>'Modern secular Judaism wants to blame the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war-crimes/holocaust/">Holocaust</a> on the Catholic Church. And it's a lie. And it's revisionism. And they've been working on that one for a while,'</i> Gibson said. ... Gibson also expressed regret about editing out of the movie a passage from the Gospel of Matthew that reads, 'His blood be on us, and on our children.' ... Gibson, referring to his critics, told the magazine: <i>'If I included that in there, they'd be coming after me at my house, they'd come kill me.'"</i>
