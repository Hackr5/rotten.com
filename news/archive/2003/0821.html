A couple who left Utah with their 12-year-old son, defying a court order to give the boy chemotherapy for cancer, were missing Wednesday after the father was released on bail from a weekend arrest in Idaho. ... Utah doctors testified that Parker Jensen has only a 5 percent chance of living without chemotherapy for a cancerous tumor, Ewing's sarcoma. ... But the parents refused, and state lawyers obtained a juvenile-court order for chemotherapy that was supposed to begin Aug. 8. ... Before a court hearing last June, the Jensens told Salt Lake City television KUTV that 45 weeks of chemotherapy would stunt their son's growth and leave him sterile. 'We are totally competent parents, and it's ridiculous that we have to come here (to juvenile court) and prove we can make decisions for our child,' Barbara Jensen told the station."
