"At least six Brazilian prisoners suffocated in a sewer after an attempted escape from the Sao Paulo State Penitentiary on Sunday afternoon, the state Security Secretariat said. In all, 87 inmates fled the penitentiary around 2 p.m. local time through a series of sewage pipes and tunnels. Police recaptured 13 fugitives in a house 500 yards away where a tunnel had been dug to meet up with the sewers... In addition to the confirmed six dead, another seven prisoners are suspected to have died in the labyrinth of pipes around the prison after losing their way, bringing the total estimated number of dead to 13."

"Denmark says it will let a group that worships Thor, Odin and other Norse gods conduct legally recognized marriages... The 240-member Forn Sidr, which worships Odin, Thor, Freya and the other members of the Norse pantheon, sought recognition in 1999, says Tissel Jacobsen, the group's president... Officially recognized religious communities can marry people and exempt their members from the 1 per cent income tax that is imposed on members of the state church. People born in Denmark are automatically made members of the state church, but can choose to leave it. Members of other recognized religious communities, such Catholics, Muslims and Jews, are also exempt from the tax."

According to the report, a large crowd turned up in a square in the city to watch the hanging of the woman-beast, only to be met by police who attempted to convince them that the bizarre rumour was in fact absolutely false... elaborate rumours had been circulating whereby a woman had 'insulted religious values' during the fasting month of Ramadan and as divine punishment had had her head turned into that of a ferocious feline."

"Richard Hammock, 48, died Nov. 2 from a shotgun wound. His dog had been shot with a pellet gun and he went to his neighbor's house to confront him about the incident. Hammock was carrying a three-foot club when he went to 33-year-old Eric Griffin's home. The district attorney says Hammock broke out the glass on Griffin's front door and then Griffin shot him. Griffin was arrested for the shooting, but district attorney Al Dominguez says he can't prosecute him because of the court's interpretation of the Make My Day Law. He says he believes it was a mistake for the state Legislature to pass the law. The law recognizes that citizens have the right to expect absolute safety within their homes. The occupant is justified in using any degree of physical force, including deadly force, against another person who makes an uninvited entry into the home and either has or might commit a crime there."

Further, the couple says - and Fish admits - he removed only the right arm of the fetus, leaving Sicker to unexpectedly pass the remainder at her home weeks later... Fish performed the procedure on June 18, 2001. On July 6, Sicker became ill at home, went to the bathroom and delivered a lifeless, 10-week-old fetus that was missing its right arm. Fish now concedes the procedure performed removed only the arm, leaving the rest of the body inside the uterus."

"Troop 34 in Alaska is learning to trap and skin beavers. In a practice that has angered animal rights activists, the girls are killing the beavers as part of a state flood-management program... Last spring, about 10 members of the Fairbanks troop and their families helped catch two beavers using snare and lethal traps. The girls were taught how to find the animals' dens and how to lay the traps. Working under close supervision, the girls used knives to skin the beavers. The troop had the pelts tanned and plans to make hats and mittens once a dozen hides are collected. The girls also want to cook beaver meat. They plan to begin setting traps out again this month."

Since the investigation is subject to secret grand jury hearings, the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/conspiracy/fbi/">FBI</a> is not officially commenting. But <i>Variety</i> and <i>The New York Times</i> report that the FBI has started calling in Hollywood big shots for questioning."

"Erik and Tyronna Green, who live in the 12400 block of Silverwyck, were shooting pool in their garage about 7:30 p.m., while Tyronna's 10-year-old daughter, Lisa Eglin slept. Tyronna's brother, Andrew Morrison, was just getting out of the shower. His girlfriend was in the house, and their cousin, Dennis Ceasar, was in the kitchen cooking gumbo. That's when about a dozen deputies with the Gulf Coast Violent Offenders Task Force burst into the home. 'All of a sudden, they were everywhere,' Morrison said of the deputies. 'Telling everybody, <i>"Get down! Get down! Get the fuck down!"</i> None of us knew what was going on. We kept telling them they had the wrong house, but they wouldn't listen.' Tyronna Green said her daughter was awakened by men pointing guns at her and yelling at her to get on the floor... Van Pelt said the deputies involved in the raid also denied the family's complaints that they had used vulgar language, including with the 10-year-old girl. 'Of course, they can certainly come forward and file a complaint, and it will be investigated,' he said."

"Defense officials notified the services in mid-October that they intend to close 19 commissaries and may close 19 more, mostly in remote areas. At the same time, the Pentagon is finishing a study to determine whether to close or transfer control of the 58 schools it operates on 14 military installations in the continental United States. The two initiatives are the latest in a string of actions by the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> administration to cut or hold down growth in pay and benefits, including basic pay, combat pay, health-care benefits and the death gratuity paid to survivors of troops who die on active duty."
