Last Friday, Lenhart, an engineer by trade and with no medical training, performed a crude castration in the dining room of the victim's home.

"Loren J. Adams ... says he likes to watch animals have sex with humans because it's taboo. 'It's kind of like a train wreck,' explains Adams, who was in court Monday as part of his ongoing legal troubles regarding this matter. 'Nobody wants to see the blood, guts and gore. But everybody slows down to watch it.' That logic explains how Adams justifies owning videos depicting animals and people having sex. ... It said that Adams was advertising the use of his own dog for sex. Indianapolis Police Department detectives were assigned to the case, and two undercover police officers, pretending to be interested in making a movie with Adams, met him at a bar. He invited them to his Southwestside mobile home."

"The head of a Montana cattlemen's group criticized the premier of Alberta for saying Canada's mad cow scare could have been avoided if the rancher who owned the sick animal had simply killed and buried it. Premier Ralph Klein said his comment to the Western Governors' Association meeting in Big Sky, Montana, Sunday was made in jest, and he was just reflecting on the 'absurd situation' Canada has found itself in since the mad cow discovery in Alberta in May. ... Mr. Klein said the rancher who owned the cow 'knew nothing about cattle ranching,' then added: 'I guess any self-respecting rancher would have shot, shovelled and shut up,' rather than ship the sickly animal for slaughter."

"The internet and text messaging are fuelling a practice which involves unprotected sex with strangers in public parks. Health chiefs in Kent have taken to posting messages on sites promoting 'dogging' -- warning of a rise in sexually-transmitted diseases. ... Dogging is an extension of 'swinging' parties -- and involves exhibitionist sex in semi-secluded locations such as car parks or country parks. The location of dogging 'events' is now frequently advertised on websites or communicated via mobile phone text message. Those attracted by these messages may simply act as voyeurs -- or be invited to participate."

The website is that of an elderly failed American presidential candidate, Lyndon LaRouche, who is also a convicted fraudster who has stood for President in elections since 1976. LaRouche was sent to prison after being convicted in the late 1980s of swindling elderly people for campaign money and tax evasion. <i>Time</i> magazine reports he has accused Queen Elizabeth 2 of drug trafficking and blamed the International Monetary Fund for creating and spreading the Aids virus. ... Ced Simpson, Amnesty International's New Zealand executive director, said basing information on a website like LaRouche was hardly reliable.

"[Craig] Wallace, a baby-faced tennis player fresh out of Spanish Fork High School, had almost the entire physics faculty of Utah State University hovering (and arguing) over an apparatus he had cobbled together from parts salvaged from junk yards and charity drops. The apparatus is nothing less than the <i>sine qua non</i> of modern science: a nuclear fusion reactor, based on the plans of Utah's own Philo Farnsworth, the inventor of television. The reactor sat on a table with an attached vacuum pump wheezing away. A television monitor showed what was inside: a glowing ball of gas surrounded by a metal helix. The ball is, literally, a small sun, where an electric field forces deuteron ions (a form of hydrogen) to gather, bang together and occasionally fuse, spitting out a neutron each time fusion occurs."

The <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> Administration has allocated nearly $1 billion in fiscal 2004 for protection of critical infrastructure, including cybersecurity.

With a monstrous federal deficit looming and the war against terrorism being refocused for the moment as part of the massively expensive campaign in Iraq, the job of securing the digital backbone of America's critical infrastructure may get even less federal support in the coming years.
