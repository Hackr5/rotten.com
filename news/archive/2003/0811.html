"The rearing of grossly overweight pigs in Taiwan for ritual slaughter has been condemned by animal welfare groups. They said it was time to end the annual 'Pigs of God' contests that revolved around the force-feeding of animals to see which could achieve the greatest mass. Pigs weighing in excess of 900 kilograms have been reported. The animals, which are incapable of standing, are dragged in front of thousands of people before having their throats cut. ... 'This competition, which involves animal abuse, should be abandoned,' East told the <i>Taipei Times</i> after showing a video about the animals. 'Most pigs were terrified. They screamed loudly and failed to control their bowels when they were moved to the scales by several people.'"

"France called emergency talks on Monday on overheating at nuclear power plants as Europe's heatwave entered its second week, with officials torn between output cuts and allowing hotter water to pour into rivers. After Paris sweltered through its hottest night since records began, a doctor in the city said more elderly people were dying from the heat and accused health authorities doing little about the crisis. Temperatures have hit around 104 degrees Fahrenheit in the past few days, spelling trouble for France's nuclear reactors, many of which are cooled by river water. The plants pour water back into the rivers but only once it has been cooled to a certain temperature to protect the environment. With river levels falling and the mercury rising, authorities face the choice of spewing out hotter water, risking ecological damage, or cutting output, potentially leading to blackouts."

"There aren't many trees that are compared to mass murderers; then again, there aren't many trees like the <i>ailanthus</i>. 'This tree has no social redeeming value whatsoever,' said Lloyd Hipkins, a Virginia Tech weed scientist. 'If you wanted to find a positive side to <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/crime/serial-killers/charles-manson/">Charles Manson</a>, you could. The same could be said of <i>ailanthus</i>.' ... Thomas Jefferson was fond of the tree that he grew around Monticello, and Fredrick Law Olmsted included it in his plans of Central Park. It has since found its way into at least 42 states, including Hawaii."
