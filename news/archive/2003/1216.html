"A construction worker was decapitated when co-workers tried to dig him out of a collapsed ditch with an excavating machine, officials said. The 39-year-old man, whose name was not released, became trapped in the ditch Monday afternoon at the intersection of Taylor Street and DeGroot Place on Staten Island. Colleagues tried to free him and another trapped worker with a backhoe, accidentally severing the first man's head... It had not yet been determined whether the man died because of the decapitation or when the trench's walls collapsed, said Paul Iannizzotto, a fire department spokesman."

The late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin ordered the mission in retaliation for the 39 Scud missiles Iraq fired at Israel during the 1991 <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/gulf-war/">Gulf War</a>. Members of Sayeret Matkal, an elite Israeli special operations force, were to sneak into Iraq and kill Saddam with special missiles while he attended a funeral. The commandos, all volunteers, were supposed to commit <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/death/suicide/">suicide</a> rather than be captured alive... The plan was cancelled when five commandos were killed while training for the mission. A live missile had been wrongly substituted for a dummy missile during the training exercise."

The accident occurred at about 10:15 p.m. at Mission and Sixth streets when a 14-Mission double electric bus slammed into the Golden Gate Adult Superstore... 'I was in the back of the bus. The next thing I know, I'm flying through the air,' said a man who declined to be identified. 'It was a big bang. No brakes, we went full speed into the building.'"

India (Nini) Bryan died at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center on Sunday night after suffering internal bleeding and brain trauma. The dancing tyke had been the life of a tenants association party inside a vacant apartment at her W. 160th St. building the night before. The festivities were winding down with a slow song by R. Kelly when Nini had fallen behind Williams. 'When I bent down to pick up the baby, I fell,' said Williams, 46, who lives across from the child's fifth-floor apartment... She disputed that she landed on the girl, and was unsure how the child was hurt."

"A Brisbane prison guard's love affair with a female inmate was exposed when she sent his love letters to his de facto wife. The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, worked as the intelligence officer at Brisbane Women's Prison and resigned several weeks ago after management confronted him with allegations of his relationship. Prison sources claimed he and the inmate were having a sexual relationship while she was housed in the residential section of the jail at Wacol in Brisbane's outer west. The inmate was eventually released from jail and the relationship continued for some time before the woman ended the affair with the officer."

"Released from prison, Ronald A. Mahner's first mistake was driving back to get his stuff. Mahner returned to the Seminole County Jail to reclaim his personal property four days after being released. He had served a sentence for drunken driving, auto theft and habitually driving with a suspended or revoked license. But when asked to provide identification, Mahner handed a sheriff's deputy his license, which after routine computer check was found to have been revoked for life."

For three days, almost half a million of people in Italy boycotted television networks owned by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, to protest the Gasparri Bill which relaxes limits on media ownership. Critics say the law would allow Berlusconi, who already owns three TV stations, to strengthen his hold on the media. Article in Italian.

"Keiko, the killer whale star of the <i>Free Willy</i> movies, was buried Monday in a snow-bound pasture during the deep darkness of Nordic winter in a ceremony kept secret from the public. 'We wanted to let him be at peace,' said Dane Richards, one of his caretakers... Richards said the burial in a pasture just yards from where Keiko, about 26, died was done in secret to avoid a media circus."

"Picture, if you will, an information infrastructure that encourages censorship, surveillance and suppression of the creative impulse. Where anonymity is outlawed and every penny spent is accounted for. Where the powers that be can smother subversive (or economically competitive) ideas in the cradle, and no one can publish even a laundry list without the imprimatur of Big Brother... 'The social, economic and legal priorities are going to force the Internet toward security,' says Stratton Sclavos, CEO of VeriSign... 'It's not going to be all right not to know who's on the other end of the wire.'"
