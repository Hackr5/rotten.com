"A consumer advocate says he's amazed by the furor he set off when he revealed part of the Social Security numbers of eight lawmakers who failed to support a financial privacy bill. ... The foundation listed the first four digits of the lawmakers' Social Security numbers on its Web site after the Assembly Banking and Finance Committee rejected a bill designed to protect consumers' financial information. ... The foundation's actions sparked furious reactions from several legislators. The committee's chairwoman, Assemblywoman Patricia Wiggins, who voted for the bill, fired off a letter to Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson, asking if there was any action the Assembly could take against Court. 'This is a blatant attempt to coerce members on an issue that reasonable people may disagree upon,' said Wiggins, D-Santa Rosa. 'In fact, I believe this borders on extortion.'"

In April, <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> ran stories alleging that a prominent British politician had received $10 million in bribes from <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam Hussein</a>. They apparently based their story on a set of forged documents for which they paid $800. It was only after outside parties began demanding corroboration for this story that the paper sent the documents out to test their authenticity. Now that they've been proven to be fakes, the <i>Monitor</i> is tapdancing. They claim that their original story mentioned that there were questions whether the documents were genuine. But they omit the fact that their April story also contained this claim: "David Blair, the British reporter who first broke the story, told the BBC: '<i>I think it would require an enormous amount of imagination to believe that someone went to the trouble of composing a forged document in Arabic and then planting it in a file of patently authentic documents and burying it in a darkened room on the off-chance that a British journalist might happen upon it and might bother to translate it. That strikes me as so wildly improbable as to be virtually inconceivable.</i>'"

"A nine-year-old tribal girl in eastern India has married a stray dog as part of a ritual to ward off an "evil spell" on her, Indian newspapers have reported. ... The girl, Karnamoni Handsa, had to be married quickly because she had a tooth rooted to her upper gum, which is considered a bad omen by her Santhal tribe in the remote village of Khanyhan, about 60 kilometres (37 miles) from Calcutta. 'Members of the village jury asked us to get her married to a dog or to face the bad omen,' the girl's father was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. The tribe elders said the marriage would not affect the girl's life, and that she would be free to marry again later and did not need to divorce the dog. ... 'I have no regret in marrying the dog Bacchan. I am fond of the dog who moves around our locality,' the girl told the AFP." With photo.

Authorities said they found six bodies in a back building at the Sherrill Harden Funeral Home, 639 Indiana Ave., and two in an adjacent garage. The bodies appear to have been there for at least several months. At least one of the bodies was 'badly chewed' by rodents on its face, fingers, hands, and feet, Toledo police Capt. Ron Spann said."

"Under a deal struck Wednesday between Erotic Empire's owners and <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/pornographers/bob-guccione/">Guccione</a>, the new store will now be known as The Penthouse Boutique. The agreement marks the first time that <i>Penthouse</i> has licensed its name to a retail store, officials said. The firm has struck similar agreements with strip clubs, including one in New York. ... Word that Milford will be the first town in the country to have its own <i>Penthouse</i> retail store sent shockwaves through the city's conservative community. 'It may say "Penthouse," but it is still in the gutter,' said Jack Fowler, a former city alderman and an associate publisher at the <i>National Review</i>, a conservative publication. Anti-pornography activist Tom Huebner said he is troubled by the new development, but was not planning any protest of next month's opening. 'I would encourage people to pray. There are people who still pray out there.'" [<i>Good idea, pray for a</i> <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/pornographers/larry-flynt/">HUSTLER</a> <i>store.
