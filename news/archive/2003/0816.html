"Former Ugandan military ruler <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/idi-amin-dada/">Idi Amin</a>, blamed for hundreds of thousands of deaths in the 1970s, has died in a hospital in Saudi Arabia, according to medical officials. ... Amin's rule was marked by extreme nationalism. He ordered the persecution of several Ugandan tribal groups and kicked all Asians out of the country in 1972, an action blamed for the collapse of the country's economy. The dictator was personally involved in the 1976 Palestinian hijacking of a French airliner to Entebbe. According to the <i>CIA World Factbook</i>, during his eight years in power, Amin's 'dictatorial regime' was 'responsible for the deaths of some 300,000 opponents.' Human rights groups say that figure is much higher, arguing that as many as 500,000 people were killed or simply disappeared under his rule. Exiles said he kept severed heads in his refrigerator, fed corpses to crocodiles and had one of his wives dismembered. He was also accused of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/death/cannibalism/">cannibalism</a>."

"The FBI's most damaging spy left clues over two decades, but lax security and the bureau's reluctance to suspect one of its own helped Robert Hanssen elude detection, according to a harsh Justice Department report. ... <b>ongoing security flaws</b> -- <i>such as an inability of agents to immediately know if someone reads their sensitive computer files</i> -- make the bureau vulnerable. 'We believe that what is needed at the FBI is a wholesale change in mind-set and approach to internal security,' the report said. ... 'Hanssen escaped detection not because he was extraordinarily clever and crafty, but because of long-standing systemic problems in the FBI's counterintelligence program and a deeply flawed FBI internal security program.'"

The elevator car then moved upward, severing the doctor's head, Jordan said. A woman who also works at the hospital was on the elevator at the time and witnessed the accident, police said.

Speaking at the Edinburgh Book Festival, Clive Bromhall said that humankind's evolution has resulted in our present state of 'infantilism,' in which we break the primate mold by being playful, creative and childlike right into adulthood. ... 'Homosexuals excel as artists, thespians and other playful, mimetic professions. Being playful is at the heart of being human. It's something that should be celebrated.
