"Jefferson County's new sheriff wants investigators to interview a former deputy who apparently was told years before the Columbine High School massacre that the gunmen bragged about making pipe bombs and were looking for a 'ground zero.' A report discovered last week indicates then-deputy John Hicks was given information in 1997 about a Web site that included the boast and the 'ground zero' reference by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Sheriff Ted Mink, who took office in July, said Wednesday the investigation of the Web site apparently went no further... Mink said an anonymous tip in 1997 had led another deputy to the Web site, run by Harris. The deputy filled out a report and sent it, along with printouts from the Web site, to Hicks, who was in charge of computer-related crimes."

"Senior Republicans have begun raising concerns about the administration's strategy in Iraq amid daily attacks on U.S. forces there... The number of attacks on U.S. forces has increased to about 30 a day in recent weeks, and a series of apparently coordinated attacks rocked Baghdad on Monday... 'Honestly, it's a little tougher than I thought it was going to be,' [Senator] Lott said. In a sign of frustration, he offered an unorthodox military solution: 'If we have to, we just mow the whole place down, see what happens. You're dealing with insane suicide bombers who are killing our people, and we need to be very aggressive in taking them out.'"

"About 3,000 people got the wrong results when they were tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia over an 18-month period, health officials say. Because of a faulty diagnostic machine in this southeastern British Columbia town, test results for the two sexually transmitted diseases were reversed... 'The machine was flipping the tests results,' Paine said. 'In other words, if you were a positive, you would have received a negative reading. If you were a negative, you would have received a positive reading.' About 3,000 people are believed to have been tested between Nov. 1, 2000, and May 24, 2002, and about 83 were told they were clean when they actually had one of the diseases... The rest of the 3,000 were told they were infected and were given treatment although they did not have the diseases."

Meth cooks spend the majority of the spring, summer and fall cooking the drug outdoors, in remote places in Iowa's countryside... 'Hunters would be well advised to not pick up or open a backpack or box or gas can laying out in the middle of nowhere. It was probably left there intentionally and probably has the remains of meth ingredients,' he said. 'Don't pick it up, don't go near it.

"The dog, a female Maltese and terrier mix, is between 9 months and 1 year old... Popcorn has an extra, or supernumerary, leg on her left back side. It is about 80 percent complete, with a femur, a tibia and one toenail. The other leg is normal, but it has been pushed to the side by the extra bones... Because of the unusual bone structure, the veterinarians may end up removing both back left legs, leaving the five-legged dog with just three."
