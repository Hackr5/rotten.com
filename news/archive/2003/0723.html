"Over six decades, likely more than 1,000 people were molested by Roman Catholic priests and church workers while leaders in the Boston archdiocese engaged in a 'massive, inexcusable failure' to do anything about it, the Massachusetts attorney general said... 'the magnitude of the archdiocese's history of clergy sexual abuse of children is staggering,' Attorney General Tom Reilly said in his report. 'The mistreatment of children was so massive and so prolonged that it borders on the unbelievable,' he said. 'The choice was very clear, between protecting children and protecting the church. They made the wrong choice,' Reilly said. 'In effect, they sacrificed children for many, many years.'"

"The U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to roll back a key provision, which allows the government to conduct secret 'sneak and peek' searches of private property, of a sweeping anti-terrorism law passed soon after the Sept. 11 attacks. The House voted 309-118... It would be the first change in the controversial USA Patriot Act since the law was enacted in October, 2001. ... 'Given its overwhelming passage this evening, the amendment is highly significant and a herald of more fix-Patriot measures to come,' said Laura Murphy, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Washington legislative office. U.S. Attorney General <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/john-ashcroft/">John Ashcroft</a> -- who has become a lightning rod for concerns over the possible erosion of U.S. civil liberties -- defended the Patriot Act on Monday, saying criticism of it was based on exaggerations and falsehoods."

Cynthia Simpson, 47, sued the board in December for refusing to add her name to a list of clergy invited to give the invocation at meetings. Miss Simpson practices Wicca, a religion based on respect for the earth, nature and the cycle of the seasons. Wiccans consider themselves witches, pagans or neo-pagans. County Attorney Steven L. Micas told U.S. Magistrate Dennis W. Dohnal that the board is within its rights in requiring invocations to reflect 'a monotheistic faith consistent with Judeo-Christian tradition.' If stripped of all control, he suggested, the board would have to allow invocations by the white-supremacist World Church of the Creator and other fringe groups." [<i>Now you're getting it.

"In a deposition released last week, the Rev. Dr. Edwin 'Ned' Cassem said he saw no need to meet the Revs. James Foley, Jay Mullin, Paul R. Shanley and Paul Tivnan before giving often harshly worded assessments of them to Archdiocese of Boston officials. One reason, he said, was because he expected them to 'lie.' Those comments -- and testimony in which Cassem spoke of Shanley as a 'scumbag' and said 'castration would have been too good for him' -- were called 'unsettling' by Dr. Spencer Eth of New York Medical College, chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's Ethics Committee."

"The parents of Ghyslain Raza, the Quebec teenager who became a celebrity this spring after classmates posted on the Internet a video of him mimicking a Star Wars character, allege that their son was so humiliated by the experience that he had to get psychiatric care. The revelation is made in a lawsuit his parents have filed against the families of four classmates they accuse of maliciously turning their son into an object of mockery. The video of Ghyslain, a portly 15-year-old pretending he is wielding a double-bladed light sabre, has been downloaded millions of times from several Web sites, which dubbed him Star Wars Kid. ... the Razas say that Ghyslain was so widely mocked at his private high school that he dropped out. ... Ghyslain 'will be under psychiatric care for an indefinite amount of time.'"

"It's a rare museum where visitors are welcomed by the founder's skeleton. But the father of the Bangkok's Forensic Museum donated his body to his life's cause, and his bones now rest in peace at the entrance for medical students and ordinary onlookers to examine. ... Visitors can study hemorrhaged brains, severed arms with tattoos, and lungs with stab wounds. In one case are skulls punctured by bullet holes, shot at from different angles by forensic scientists in an experiment to study how bullets ricochet inside a human head. Results helped them analyze evidence in murder cases. ... By far the most popular display is the mummified body of Si Ouey, a notorious cannibal and serial killer of boys and girls in the late 1950s."

The Seattle Police Department didn't discipline the veteran officer, who had been accused of domestic violence before, in 1998 and 1999. ... Over the past five years, 41 officers in King and Pierce counties alone have been accused of assaulting, stalking, threatening or harassing their wives, girlfriends or children, a five-month investigation by the <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i> has found."

"Bayer at first was told by Watanabe that Ferdinand had been 'given to a friend.' When she asked for more information, she was told Ferdinand 'was gelded and I think he's at a riding club far away from here.' In fact, records showed Ferdinand was bred to six mares in 2001 and then two in 2002. He spent a period of time at Goshima Farm near Niikappu, where a former handler at Arrow Stud had seen him. Finally, when Bayer told Watanabe she wanted to see Ferdinand, the story changed yet again. 'Actually, he isn't around anymore,' she was told. 'He was <i>disposed of</i> late last year.' ... 'In Japan, the term "disposed of" is used to mean <i>slaughtered</i>,' Bayer wrote in <i>The Blood-Horse</i>. 'No one can say for sure when and where Ferdinand met his end, but it would seem clear he met it in a slaughterhouse.'"

'It conjures up all kinds of horrendous pictures, like <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i> or <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>,' she told WBZ-Radio. '(But) it isn't anything like that. ... I was just so fortunate that this miracle form, ECT, happened,' Dukakis said."

'I think all foreigners should stop interfering in the internal affairs of Iraq,' said Wolfowitz, who is touring the country to meet U.S. troops and Iraqi officials. ... Washington has several times warned neighboring countries -- in particular Iran and Syria -- to keep out of Iraq's internal affairs. Tehran hit back, saying Washington was being hypocritical, having invaded the country."

"The notorious 'elephant man' may have suffered from two rare disorders, according to scientists. They believe Joseph Merrick, who lived in Britain more than 100 years ago, could have suffered from type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) and Proteus Syndrome. They believe both conditions may have combined to trigger his severe physical deformities. Their claim, which is featured in a new series on the Discovery Health channel, follows DNA tests on the man's hair and bones."
