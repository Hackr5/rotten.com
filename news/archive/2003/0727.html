"Juan Batista and his former girlfriend went out together last week to buy party decorations for their 2-year-old son Omar's upcoming birthday. That party won't happen now. Batista, enraged after seeing his ex with a new man Friday, hung Omar with a brown electrical cord in the bathroom of an Elmhurst hotel room, law enforcement sources said. Then the father went from his third-floor room at the Crown Motor Inn to the hotel's front desk. 'There's a body upstairs,' Batista told the night clerk at about 1:30 a.m., according to police. 'Call 911.'"

Nixon</a> personally ordered the burglary of Democratic headquarters at the Watergate complex. Jeb Stuart Magruder -- then a 'callow' campaign aide, now a retired Presbyterian minister in Ohio -- says in a new documentary for PBS that he heard Nixon's voice on a telephone as the president instructed then-Attorney General John N. Mitchell to go ahead with the break-in. ... What he recalls hearing Nixon say was: 'John, we need to -- we need to get the information on [Democratic Party Chairman] Larry O'Brien. And the only way we can do that is through Liddy's plan. And you need to do that.'"

Schwarzenegger, who declined to be interviewed, has professed interest in a new career in politics. ... If he wishes to lead the state, political analyst Bruce Cain said, the recall election is his 'best chance.' 'All his liabilities won't matter if he needs just 21 percent of the vote,' the University of California, Berkeley political science professor said. 'There are going to be enough Californians who don't care about the dope and the women. ... The hedonist vote is probably at least 25 percent of the vote in California.'"

But relatives say that's impossible; they claim the 32-year-old, who was black, was found with his hands tied behind his back. Rumors began swirling that Ray Golden was lynched. Friends say Golden was dating a white policeman's daughter in this rural farming community of about 15,000, divided almost equally between black and white residents."

On a larger scale, the case illustrates Attorney General <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/john-ashcroft/">John Ashcroft</a>'s vow to beef up Justice Department efforts to target obscenity. In the past 10 years, the Justice Department has focused resources on child pornographers or pedophiles who prowl Internet chat rooms looking for children to molest. Ashcroft is adding resources to combat adult material. Ashcroft also changed a policy that required prosecutors from the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section to seek approval from a local U.S. attorney before filing obscenity cases. Now, these specialized prosecutors in Washington can pursue obscenity cases after simply notifying local U.S. attorneys."

"For instance, there was the family of a Canadian man who was killed when he started rocking a 925-pound Coke machine and it tipped over on him. The lawsuit said the machine should have carried a warning that if a person rocks a 925-pound Coke machine, it might tip over and kill him. Or the Pennsylvania man who let go of a stretched elastic cord on the hood of his coat, which then snapped back and hit him in the eye. He sued the maker of the coat because it failed to offer a warning that an elastic cord, when stretched and let go, will tend to snap back. Or the parents of a man killed when he sneaked into a pool containing a large killer whale at SeaWorld in Florida. They sued because the pool offered no warning that it is not a good idea to be in the same pool with a large killer whale. Or the man who leaned too close to the stage at a Canadian strip club and was kicked in the nose by a stripper who was swinging around a pole. He sued the strip club because it failed to warn patrons that if they leaned onto the stage, they might be kicked in the nose by the stripper swinging around a pole."

"Rod Paige, the secretary of education, yesterday defended the record of the public schools in Houston, where he was superintendent before joining the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> administration. Advances in student achievement, Dr. Paige said, were genuine and 'still standing,' though he said 'there <i>probably</i> was' a dropout problem. ... The state audited 16 middle schools and high schools and found that of 5,500 teenagers who had left school in the 2000-1 school year, about 3,000, or 55 percent, should have been reported as dropouts. ... Houston as a whole reported a 1.5 percent annual dropout rate, though education experts estimate that the true percentage of students who quit before graduation is nearer 40 percent."

"New Yorkers have been using forwarded e-mails to coordinate 'flash mobs,' or not-so-random crowds that appear and dissipate within a matter of minutes. ... To protect the planned serendipity of each event, participants aren't told exactly what the mob is supposed to do until just before the event happens. ... 'It's really stunning to be in the mob as it comes together,' Bill wrote, 'to see all these people, who up until that very moment seemed unaware of each other, suddenly converge.'"
