"An FBI agent says there was little that police in Erie, Pennsylvania, could have done to save a man who said he was forced to rob a bank by someone who strapped explosives to his body. ... Police probably could not have saved Wells from the bomb if it was armed with a timing device, FBI special agent Ken McCabe, whose agency is helping in the investigation, said. ... 'As soon as they confirmed that he in fact had a bomb on him, they backed off, did a perimeter of at least 300 yards around him. They protected innocent lives,' McCabe said. 'Police and agents are not trained to go and defuse a bomb. It's not like TV shows where we go up and try to guess, <i>"Do we cut the red wire or the green wire?"</i> It's too dangerous.'"

Even a very modestly dressed woman could stir up desires in the opposite sex by applying glossy lipstick or perfume, he said. ... the controversial minister regularly appears to place the blame for men's failings on women.

Pater had acknowledged molesting the girl when he was confronted about a decade ago, she said. ... In addition, the Rev. Lawrence Breslin, a pastor of the church where the abuse began, told the News he had spoken twice about Pater's past to Bishop James M. Harvey, a longtime Vatican state department executive who now heads the pope's personal staff. Pater just recently resigned from his post as the church's second-highest-ranking diplomat in India."

"Much has been made over the report produced by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB). I have since read newspaper articles that called the report 'scathing.' Hardly. Its polite recommendations probably had Shuttle managers who made poor decisions dancing down their office hallways with relief. Essentially, it gave them a pass by proclaiming 'culture' made them do it. ... I do not believe there is a NASA culture other than a willingness by its engineers to work their butts off to keep us in space. It might be said, however, that there is a Shuttle cult. It is practiced like a religion by space policy makers who simply cannot imagine an American space agency without the Shuttle. Well, I can and it is a space agency which can actually fly people and cargoes into orbit without everybody involved being terrified of imminent death and destruction every time the Shuttle lifts off the pad."

"Three Chinese children and their cousin have died two hours after eating toad soup -- a brew cooked by their mother in the belief it would be good for digestion. ... The children, aged between seven and 11, started feeling unwell soon after eating the soup. The woman and other family members treated them at home. This failed and they rushed the children to a nearby hospital, but all four died, <i>Xinhua</i> said."

"Two female students contacted college management after the incident where they claim the lecturer exposed himself indecently to them in a work-out room. The district attorney filed a suit against the man after the local police suggested not prosecuting the case. However, in the criminal case the lecturer was unanimously acquitted. ... According to witness accounts from students, the incident took place when the lecturer got an erection while he was lying on a work-out mat lifting weights. The court bases its decision on the fact that even if one of the women claims that she saw his penis, the majority of the people in court claimed that this was not his intention."

"Attorney General <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/john-ashcroft/">John Ashcroft</a> says he is ruling out any future campaign for elective office, but he indicates that he would like to continue serving the administration if President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> is elected to a second term. ... Ashcroft was nominated to be attorney general after losing his U.S. Senate seat in 2000 to Democrat Mel Carnahan, whose name remained on the ballot after his death just before Election Day. ... Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said recently that he remembers talking with Ashcroft shortly after his re-election loss and his subsequent nomination as attorney general. 'I recall us discussing how it was like he had fallen into the sewer and had come up (after his nomination to be attorney general) with a roast beef sandwich,' Specter said."

"A new amendment to forthcoming legislation will force water companies to add fluoride to water supplies, smoothing the way for the largest extension of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/conspiracy/fluoridation/">fluoridation</a> for almost 50 years. Opponents have condemned the moves, accusing Ministers of mass medication by stealth and a 'nanny state' mentality. They also claim fluoride has been linked to adverse health affects including cancer, brittle bones and thyroid disease and can cause teeth to mottle."
