Staff at the Magna Science Adventure Centre, in Rotherham, were forced to inform aviation authorities after the 'flyborg' floated off into the sky as it was being moved. The 13-feet long airship can expand to four times its usual size as it flies, and could fly for a week before it deflates. ... The flyborg has a computerised brain which allows it to avoid obstacles."

"A South Carolina woman accused of putting a disinterred skeleton in her car and setting the vehicle on fire in an attempt to stage her own death has been arrested in Florida. Sandra Grice, 37, of Dillon County, S.C., was charged with desecration of human remains, arson and violation of federal probation, said Sheriff Billy Page of Marion County in South Carolina. ... Grice staged her death last year to avoid appearing in court on federal drug charges... Last October, a passer-by discovered a female skeleton in Grice's 1998 smoke-filled Ford Contour, which was abandoned near a wooded area of Marion County. But the flames had gone out because the doors were closed and the windows were rolled up, so the fire ran out of oxygen."

"Canadian defence scientists are leading an international effort to devise protection against new and more powerful terrorist explosives designed to flatten buildings and rupture people's internal organs. The weapons, referred to as thermobaric explosives, were developed during the Cold War in the Soviet Union, but there are concerns the devices may have now made their way into the hands of terrorists or rogue nations. At the same time, some terrorist bombs, such as the one detonated last year by <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda/">al-Qaeda</a> operatives on the Indonesian island of Bali, use the same principles that are behind thermobaric explosives."

"A woman who says she noticed a video camera in the ceiling of an Alpharetta Toys 'R' Us restroom is suing the retailer for invasion of privacy. Tamara Perez says she noticed a hole in the ceiling above the commode while visiting the suburban Atlanta store on March 21. According to her lawsuit, Perez quickly left the women's restroom and asked her husband to investigate. Walter Perez moved a ceiling tile and found a video camera with a transmitter device, according to the lawsuit. ... 'The camera was not one of our surveillance cameras, nor was it placed with the knowledge of anyone associated with Toys "R" Us,' spokeswoman Susan McLaughlin wrote in a statement."

"Criminal charges were dropped against a man whose defense lawyer claimed that drinking jasmine tea made him temporarily insane before he smashed his way into a neighbor's house and chased the woman with a dagger. Police said they found a wild-eyed Gilbert Walker, 43, outside the house in nearby Callaway yelling 'I'm crazy' after he had broken a glass door with a brass duck. ... Jasmine is an herb commonly taken to calm the stomach but is also used as a love potion in satanic and cult rituals, defense lawyer Mike Hunter said. ... Walker's former girlfriend gave him the tea to settle his stomach, but didn't warn him to limit his intake and he consumed up to 10 cups daily."

"Under a new policy adopted last month, male park workers, for the first time, can wear braids provided they are above the collar, neatly tied close to the scalp and in straight rows. Female workers, who can now wear small hoop earrings, have been able to braid their hair for years. ... The last time Disney changed its grooming policy was in 2000 when the company allowed workers to grow mustaches. In 1994, female theme-park workers were permitted to use eye shadow and eyeliner and balding men were allowed to wear toupees. ... Even though Walt Disney wore a mustache, he was a stickler when it came to the grooming of park employees, wanting them to maintain clean-cut images at <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/travel/disneyland/">Disneyland</a>."

"Edward James Olmos, the star of the new <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, has some advice for devoted fans of the 1970s sci-fi series: Don't watch the remake. As executives of the Sci Fi channel cringed, Olmos told reporters during the Television Critics Association summer tour that he 'would not advise them to watch this program. It will hurt them ... The intent and the way we've built the reality is very different from the reality of the original.' ... The new <i>Battlestar</i> -- which will make its debut in December as a four-hour mini-series but is expected to become a series -- is not going to be a faithful re-creation of the original."

"Politicians and terrorists are not the only propagandists who use fear to drive human behaviour in irrational directions. ... President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> himself appeared in TV commercials, urging Americans to 'live their lives' by going ahead with plans for vacations and other consumer purchases. 'The president of the US is encouraging us to buy,' wrote marketer Chuck Kelly in an editorial for the <i>Minneapolis-St Paul Star Tribune</i>, which argued that America was 'embarking on a journey of spiritual patriotism' that 'is about pride, loyalty, caring and believing' -- and, of course, selling. 'As marketers, we have the responsibility to keep the economy rolling,' wrote Kelly. 'Our job is to create customers during one of the more difficult times in our history.'"
