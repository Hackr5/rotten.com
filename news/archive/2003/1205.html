"Police in Northern Ireland have used '<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/crime/serial-killers/">serial killers</a>' as informants and shielded them from prosecution, an ex-RUC detective has alleged. Johnston Brown, a retired CID sergeant, also claimed more could have been done to bring a feared north Belfast UVF squad to justice. The ex-officer has been a vociferous critic of past practices of Special Branch, the controversial police intelligence wing... He states in the interview that police informants went outside official parameters on some occasions. 'Including murder? Yes they did. Were they protected by the highest authority? Yes, they were.'"

"<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/richard-perle/">Richard Perle</a>, a prominent Pentagon adviser, lobbied on behalf of Boeing's bid for a controversial $18bn government contract a year after the aerospace company made a $20m investment in the venture capital fund he runs. Mr Perle, a former <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/ronald-reagan/">Reagan</a>-era assistant defence secretary, is considered one of the most influential civilian members of Washington's defence establishment... In August, Mr Perle co-authored an Op-Ed piece in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> arguing in favour of a deal in which the Air Force would lease 100 767 aircraft refuelling tankers from Boeing... Mr Perle did not disclose that Boeing had committed to invest $20m in his venture capital fund, Trireme Partners, in mid-2002. The investment marked one of the largest early stakes taken in the fund by a corporate partner... Internal Boeing e-mails portray a lobbying campaign the company undertook to have 'friends on the Hill' and 'think tanks' drum up support for the deal."

"A powerful explosion ripped through an electric commuter train in southern Russia on Friday morning, killing at least 41 people and injuring at least 155. Authorities called it a 'terrorist' act by a <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/religion/martyrdom/suicide-bombers/">suicide bomber</a>, an unidentified man who reportedly detonated a shrapnel-filled bomb aboard the train... The crowded rush-hour train had just pulled out from a station in the town of Yessentuki in the Stavropol region not far from Chechnya when its second car suddenly shattered in the blast, sending some passengers flying through the air and spraying metal shards through scores of Russians heading to work... Female suicide bombers, often called 'black widows' by the Russian tabloid press, have been responsible for many of the terrorist attacks over the last year."

"A student expelled from Parkway High for a year for having Advil, an over-the-counter pain reliever, will not be allowed to return to the school. Kelly Herpin and daughter Amanda Stiles, a sophomore, appealed the one-year expulsion to a Bossier Parish School Board committee Thursday night, spending about 10 minutes with the board's administrative committee behind closed doors. The committee and the full board voted unanimously to uphold an administrative decision that Stiles be expelled to the alternative school... Superintendent Ken Kruithof said after the board meeting that the school system is following a state law that requires a one-year expulsion and being consistent in the system's 'zero-tolerance' policy. But another school official said earlier Thursday that having medication on campus doesn't automatically lead to a one-year expulsion."

Haidl is awaiting a March trial on the rape charges. Under terms of his $100,000 bail, a drug arrest would have landed the 18-year-old in jail immediately."

"A former Jenkintown karate instructor - charged with sexually molesting two teenage girls who were his students - has been acquitted of three of the most serious charges after telling the court he was gay. Lee Glazer, 38, of Hatboro was found not guilty Wednesday of three assault charges... Defense attorney Stephen Jarrett said he was not sure how much weight jurors gave to his defense that it was not in Glazer's nature to make sexual advances to young girls because he was homosexual."

"A junior high school principal was arrested Thursday for molesting a former student on the pretext of treating the boy's 'cancer of the testicles,' police said. Masahiko Matsuoka, 60, has admitted to the allegations of performing obscene acts on the 16-year-old boy last year... Matsuoka insisted upon 'examining' the boy's private parts and told him, 'You have developed cancer of the testicles. I can treat you, however, because I happen to be one of Japan's top experts in the field.'"

The official, Shigetaro Nishiwaki, 59, an assistant of the head of the Metropolitan Police Department's Identification division, was arrested on suspicion of violating a Metropolitan ordinance that forbids people from creating a public nuisance... Investigators said Nishiwaki molested the 17-year-old for 2 minutes from about 10:16 p.m. on Wednesday, putting his hand inside the youth's underwear, as they rode on a JR Chuo Line train between Nakano and Koenji stations."

"The latest case comes from Florida, where the University of Florida's student newspaper, <i>The Alligator</i>, sued for the right to print NASCAR racer Dale Earnhardt's autopsy photos. Earnhardt, a seven-time Winston Cup champion, died during the Daytona 500 on Feb. 18, 2001 when his car slammed into a wall. He died instantly of injuries to the head. There was a media frenzy to cover the event and anything connected with Earnhardt was fair game, even the autopsy photos. The State of Florida, however, disagreed and passed a law banning the press from seeing and printing autopsy photos. There is a $5,000 fine for the unauthorized copying and publication of autopsy photos. This law applies to Internet sites as well, to prevent sites like <a href="http://www.rotten.com/" target="_blank">Rotten.com</a>, which displays grotesque pictures, from picking them up and publishing them on the World Wide Web."
