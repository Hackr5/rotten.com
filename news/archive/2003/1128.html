"The Senate sergeant-at-arms has opened an investigation into Republicans obtaining and publicizing internal memos from the computer and network resources of two Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Late Tuesday, Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) confirmed that his inquiry had found that a member of his staff 'had improperly accessed some of the documents' and a second former staff member 'may also have been involved.' ... Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee along with Kennedy and Durbin, requested that [the sergeant-at-arms] hire security experts to determine who retrieved the documents. They also asked for an audit of logs to determine who may have been trying to access the files or directories from which the memos had been copied. Two days later, the senators complained to Hatch that he had not yet given consent for the committee hard drives to be turned over."

"Seven days after George Pavlovsky was fired from his job as a senior tree cutter with the City of Moncton, the Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 51 filed a grievance to his employer challenging the dismissal... The 44-year-old arrived at the Moncton Public Works Operation Centre on April 10 extremely intoxicated and carrying a sawed-off shotgun and a handgun. He was looking for two senior managers. The two were not in their offices, but in meetings at the time. As he stormed through the sprawling operations centre, his two dozen co-workers ran for cover or fled the building... A co-worker disarmed the disgruntled employee and Mounties arrived shortly afterward and arrested him."

Ripken said he called 911, though police did not identify him by name... The wounded man, Brian Robins, 20, of Baltimore, was found on Ripken's porch around 9 p.m. Thursday. He was taken by helicopter to a hospital and was released early Friday, officials said. Robins told police that he was kidnapped Thursday by three men who held him captive for nine hours, forced him into the trunk of their car, then ordered him to strip and run, Vinson said.

During one incident at the milking shed, apparently as punishment for taking too long to clean up, Wilson hosed the man down before repeatedly hitting him with a hammer and then jumping on his head with steel-capped gumboots. Wilson left him lying unconscious on jagged concrete... On December 18 he ordered the man to wear a dog collar and leash, pulling him around the house and punching him as he went."

Favre, of Greenacres, faces between eight and almost 16 years for one court of sexual misconduct with a minor and four counts of providing alcohol to minors... The charges were filed after sheriff's officials learned that Duane and Favre hosted several parties over a four-month period at Duane's home in which women provided rum, vodka and beer to the boys, ages 12 and older, under the condition that they abided by 'Amy's rule' - that they wouldn't get too drunk."

Some analysts wonder whether the CIA contractors are subject to proper oversight from the CIA and Congress."

I forgot.' the United States star told the <i>East Valley Tribune</i> newspaper. He said he had been taking the medication for at least seven months to treat anxiety. When tested, his blood-alcohol level was two-and-a-half times above the legal limit for Arizona, according to court documents...

"'An abomination, impure and simple.' ... 'Like being run over by a garbage truck that backs up and dumps its load on top of you.' ... 'If the producers had dug up Ted Geisel's body and hung it from a tree, they couldn't have desecrated the man any more.' ... 'Charmless, pointless and all but witless adaptation, with even less charisma than that flesh-eating virus of holiday films, 2000's <i>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</i>. Take someone you hate... Perhaps the worst holiday movie ever made.' ... 'They might as well have skipped the hassle of securing licensing rights and simply called this mess <i>Mike Myers: Asshole in Fur.'"</i>
