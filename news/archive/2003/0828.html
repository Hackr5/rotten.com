The attack on the school in western Japan two years ago was unprecedented in scale and severely shook the national sense of security, already battered by a series of senseless crimes. Mamoru Takuma, 39, an unemployed man who had previously received treatment for mental illness, pleaded guilty to the killings and to injuring 13 other children and two teachers at Ikeda elementary school near Osaka. Seven girls and a boy between the ages of six and eight were killed by Takuma in June 2001 when he burst into their classroom and started slashing at random with a long knife."

"He wrote that the fascination of sexuality in a negative form has long been a feature of Christianity and that the crucifix had been rendered unauthentic by this negative sexual mindset. 'Most certainly Jesus would have been crucified naked, as was the Roman practice,' Father Dobson wrote. 'At some stage it was decided that Jesus' sexuality must be covered up, and so he was draped in a loincloth, which somehow would make him more presentable in polite Christian company! It is also as if sex had to be removed from this powerful image.' Father Dobson said the crucifix should never have become the symbol of Christianity because it was a means of execution."

"The <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> administration is expected to formally announce Thursday or Friday that it doesn't think it has the authority to cap emissions of carbon dioxide and other 'greenhouse gases'... Word from the Environmental Protection Agency that it believes it lacks authority under the nation's Clean Air Act to regulate emissions that are believed to be raising the Earth's temperature comes just after the agency issued another controversial set of rules making it easier for older power plants and factories to be upgraded without costly antipollution controls."

"The International Monetary Fund has warned the United States that while speedy economic recovery there would benefit the whole world economy, the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> administration should pay more attention to the instability threatened by its huge budget deficit. ... The Fund thinks it could balloon to $550bn -- that would be more than 5% of economic output, significantly greater than the 3% limit that eurozone countries are required to aim for."
