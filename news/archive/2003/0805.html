"The Ministry of Defence confirmed last night that a document at the centre of a security breach three days after the suicide of government weapons adviser David Kelly had been passed to police investigating the death of the scientist. But the MoD fiercely denied allegations that it had attempted to burn or shred a 'media plan' relating to Kelly at their Whitehall headquarters. The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> reported that officials were preparing to <b>incinerate</b> a media strategy dealing with the fallout from the Kelly affair when they were spotted by security guards. ... The MoD confirmed there had been a security breach on 20 July when guards discovered that a document referring to Kelly had been mistakenly placed in a 'burn bag' to be taken for incineration. The incident would normally have been dealt with internally, but the guards took the unusual step of alerting the Ministry of Defence Police."

"A man who bit off his best friend's two ears during a row over a broken window has been imprisoned for 15 months. ... James McGrory, 30, who had been drinking and smoking cannabis before the attack, shrugged his shoulders at Glasgow Sheriff Court as he was told that prison was the only option. ... In a letter handed to the court, McGrory wrote: 'I did not mean to do what I did. I was shocked by the way I reacted. I hope one day we can be friends again.'"

"Elizabeth Taylor is at the centre of a tawdry legal drama in which she is accused of having sex with her own butler. Taylor's former gardener has made extraordinary claims that the film legend slept with her gay butler in her Hollywood mansion. He has also made the humiliating claim that the 33-year-old butler needed to take Viagra to have sex with the 71-year-old film star, a woman famous for receiving priceless jewellery from adoring men who fell under her spell. The gardener also claimed the butler mockingly referred to how he 'had to jump on the old trampoline.'"

New Zealand adult film-maker Steve Crow is behind the protest and a spokeswoman said he was not expecting authorities to try to stop it.

"It may be all right for girls to bathe topless in pools in, say, Brazil, but don't try going topless at a water park in Detroit -- even if you're only 3 years old. ... Suhayla had her bikini bottom on, but her mother had forgotten the matching top. ... Topless toddlers apparently can spark lust in adults who are sexually attracted to children -- at least that's what Sorel said the park's security guards repeatedly told her during the standoff. ... The guards then threatened to call Detroit police on Sorel and her topless tot. And finally, at Sorel's own urging, they did."

As for sex in the jail, Feltner admitted that carelessness by a maintenance worker earlier this year allowed female inmates to get a master key to jail cells, which they used for two weeks to get into male inmates' cells.
