"Talk-radio titan <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/pundits/rush-limbaugh/">Rush Limbaugh</a> is being investigated for allegedly buying thousands of addictive painkillers from a black-market drug ring. The moralizing motormouth was turned in by his former housekeeper -- who says she was Limbaugh's pill supplier for four years. Wilma Cline, 42, says Limbaugh was hooked on the potent prescription drugs OxyContin, Lorcet and hydrocodone -- and went through detox twice. 'There were times when I worried,' Cline told the <i>National Enquirer</i>, which broke the story in an edition being published today. 'All these pills are enough to kill an elephant -- never mind a man.'"

Three of the women said he had grabbed their breasts, while a fourth said he placed his hand under her skirt on her buttock. A fifth woman says Mr Schwarzenegger tried to take off her bathing suit in a hotel elevator, while the last says he pulled her onto his lap and asked her about a particular sex act. ... Three of the women said they work in Hollywood and fear retaliation if they make their accusations publicly."

Estimates on the number of people killed range from 38 to several hundred. ... there is evidence 38 people were killed at Tlatetlolco Plaza. Human rights groups have contended several hundred died, but government officials hid the bodies so an exact count was impossible.

"The former owner of Sugarloaf/USA has resigned from The Jackson Laboratory after admitting he falsely listed the prestigious Navy Cross as a military accomplishment on his job resume. Monday, Warren C. Cook Sr. also admitted he does not hold a master's degree from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and was not on the 1968 U.S. Olympic hockey team, as he stated on his resume."

"A French mathematics teacher is under investigation by education officials for asking students to solve a set of equations based on the death of actress Marie Trintignant after a domestic drama that shocked France. The teacher from Macon in central France devised equations to describe the blows Trintignant suffered in the incident in a Lithuanian hotel, the local education authority said today. ... The maths exercise, printed in French newspapers today, recounted the circumstances in breezy tones before outlining blows in the form of equations for the pupils to solve."

"A visitor to Black Hills National Cemetery told officials Tuesday that a naked woman was filming herself among the grave markers. Cemetery director Bob Poe said an unidentified man said he had seen a woman without her clothes on videotaping herself. Poe said he drove to the location -- in the F section of the cemetery -- and tried to confront a woman in a gold PT Cruiser. 'She just drove away,' Poe said, adding that the woman, fully clothed when he saw her, appeared to be in her late 40s."

"A forensic expert in the US believes he has some of the strongest evidence yet that the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/cryptozoology/bigfoot/">Bigfoot</a>, or sasquatch, creature exists. ... Investigator Jimmy Chilcutt of the Conroe Police Department in Texas, who specialises in finger and footprints, has said he believes he is certain around six footprints found -- claimed to have been made by Bigfoot -- are genuine. ... 'There is a significant amount of evidence for Bigfoot -- there are tracks, there are fuzzy photographs, there are hair samples, there are sighting reports -- the problem is that it's not good evidence,' said Benjamin Radford, managing editor of <i>Skeptical Inquirer</i> magazine."
