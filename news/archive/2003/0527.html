somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"The premise behind Walker's USHomeGuard is simple: America has 47,000 power plants, airports and other 'critical infrastructure facilities.' Walker believes a terrorist can get within 100 feet of most of them, unchallenged and undetected, and kill or injure thousands. But if onsite cameras beamed photos to the World Wide Web, Americans could monitor these sites from home. If they spied a potential attacker -- a masked man trying to scale a power plant fence, or a van parked next to a reservoir -- they could alert security agents with a click of the mouse. Agents would call local authorities and help avert disaster. Walker envisions spotters getting up to $10 per hour, paid by the government agencies and companies that need protecting."

They bellowed through bullhorns, made sirens pierce through the night and papered the Los Angeles neighborhood in leaflets denouncing Huntingdon Life Sciences officials as, among other things, 'puppy killers.' ... the group, Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, later warned the executive on its Web site. 'We know where you live, we know where you work, and we'll make your life hell until you pull out of HLS.' What made the noisy protest unusual was that its target wasn't an executive with Huntingdon Life Sciences: It was a manager of a Los Angeles company that just sells software to Huntingdon."

"Two Texas prison inmates have received permission to marry even though they have never met and cannot honeymoon until at least 2036, officials said on Friday. Diane Zamora, 25, and Steven Mora, 27, were sent a marriage license application after the Texas Attorney General's office ruled they could become husband and wife despite their unusual circumstances, Bexar County Clerk Gerry Rickhoff said. Once the application is completed and approved, they can marry stand-ins at ceremonies at their separate prisons, which are 130 miles apart, officials said." So let me get this straight: Texas will marry jailbirds who've <i>never even met</i>, but not homosexual couples. Good job keeping sacred that institution of matrimony.

"A naked man walked into an Uptown liquor store and fatally stabbed a customer for no apparent reason, police said Monday. The man, who was only wearing a sock on one foot, walked into the Foremost Liquor Store, 1040 W. Argyle, on Sunday afternoon brandishing a knife, said Chicago police spokesman Carlos Herrera. He then grabbed a bottle of vodka, and on his way out of the store, he attacked a customer who was walking in, killing him, Herrera said."

"An ambulance driver has been charged with speeding as he delivered a liver for a life-saving transplant. [The driver] was snapped doing 104mph by a camera on the A1. He had blue lights flashing on his ambulance service Vauxhall Vectra, which is converted for transporting organs and blood. And it happened at 3:30am, when traffic was light and road conditions were said to be good. But Mike, who has an unblemished record after 36 years of driving, could now be banned -- and sacked from his job."

"Two art students are planning to grow trees containing the genetic identity of human beings. The idea is to replace the unused 'junk' DNA in trees with entire human genomes. Scientists have advised the pair that it is perfectly feasible. The 'humanised' trees would be unaffected by the change, but still carry the biological essence of the DNA donors. One possibility envisaged is that the trees could replace gravestones as a way of preserving the memory of loved ones. If an apple tree was used, it would provide an edible as well as a visible reminder. Like the tree, the fruit would contain human DNA." 'Mommy, I DON'T WANNA eat grandma!'
