"For decades, priests in this country abused children in parish after parish while their superiors covered it all up. Now it turns out the orders for this cover up were written in Rome at the highest levels of the Vatican.  ... The confidential Vatican document, obtained by CBS News, lays out a church policy that calls for absolute secrecy when it comes to sexual abuse by priests -- anyone who speaks out could be thrown out of the church. The policy was written in 1962 by Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani. ... Bishops are instructed to pursue these cases 'in the most secretive way...restrained by a perpetual silence...and everyone (including the alleged victim) ...is to observe the strictest secret, which is commonly regarded as a secret of the Holy Office...under the penalty of excommunication.'"

"Alberto Fujimori peers into his laptop computer, quietly plotting a return to power half a world away, all but oblivious to being a wanted man who can't leave the confines of Japan for fear of arrest. ... Mr. Fujimori, who resigned in November 2000 amid a corruption scandal, hardly seems bothered that in Peru he is wanted on charges of murder, embezzlement and treason. ... A demand for Mr. Fujimori's arrest from international police authorities has been at the National Police Agency's headquarters since March. After examining a 700-page extradition request from Peru, Japan signaled last week that it would reject the request because Mr. Fujimori is now a Japanese citizen. Also, Peru has no extradition treaty with Japan."

His biggest outburst, however, came after Bosielo had already left the court: he angrily started throwing things around -- including a heavy legal book, which narrowly missed a frightened stenographer and saw advocates and journalists fleeing the courtroom. ... Meintjies, who was reported to have masturbated and thrown semen at people during a court appearance in the Regional Court, on two occasions appeared in the high court semi-naked and once had to be carried in and out of court by two policemen because he was so drugged that he could not stand up."

The Pentagon is downplaying an editorial written by a former "senior Pentagon Middle East specialist, Air Force Lt Col Karen Kwiatkowski, who worked in the office of Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith until her retirement in April. 'What I saw was aberrant, pervasive and contrary to good order and discipline,' Kwiatkowski wrote. 'If one is seeking the answers to why peculiar bits of "intelligence" found sanctity in a presidential speech, or why the post-<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam</a> occupation has been distinguished by confusion and false steps, one need look no further than the process inside the Office of the Secretary of Defense [OSD].' Kwiatkowski went on to charge that the operations she witnessed during her tenure in Feith's office, and particularly those of an ad hoc group known as the Office of Special Plans (OSP), constituted 'a subversion of constitutional limits on executive power and a co-option through deceit of a large segment of the Congress.'"

"Scientists believe the shape of the penis may have evolved to help men remove the semen of love rivals during sex. Tests led a team of US researchers, headed by Professor Gordon Gallup, to conclude that the penis acts as a 'semen displacement device' and its shape has evolved in part to displace another man's semen. ... Lead researcher Professor Gordon Gallup told BBC News Online: 'We theorize that as a consequence of competition for paternity, human males evolved uniquely configured penises that function to displace semen from the female vagina left by other males. Thus, the human penis may enable males to substitute their semen for the semen of their competitors.'"
