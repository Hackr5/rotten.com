"A film producer who chronicled <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/actors/arnold-schwarzenegger/">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>'s rise to fame as a champion bodybuilder in the 1970's circulated a book proposal six years ago that quoted the young Mr. Schwarzenegger expressing admiration for <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/nazi/adolf-hitler/">Adolf Hitler</a>. ... In a part of the interview not used in the film, Mr. Schwarzenegger was asked to name his heroes... <i>'It depends for what,'</i> Mr. Schwarzenegger said, according to the transcript in the book proposal. <i>'I admired Hitler, for instance, because he came from being a little man with almost no formal education up to power. And I admire him for being such a good public speaker.'</i> In addition to the transcript, Mr. Butler wrote in his book proposal that in the 1970's, he considered Mr. Schwarzenegger a 'flagrant, outspoken admirer of Hitler.' In the proposal, Mr. Butler also said he had seen Mr. Schwarzenegger playing '<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/nazi/">Nazi</a> marching songs from long-playing records in his collection at home' and said that the actor 'frequently clicked his heels and pretended to be an S.S. officer.'"

"Before scat-sniffing dogs were trained, researchers visually searched areas for droppings. It was a time-consuming job that wasn't always easy. Some animals defecate conspicuously but others try to hide their dung. Even when found, some scat, such as black bear and grizzly bear, look so similar that they are easily confused. Dogs make the process easier. They cover larger areas, faster and more accurately, using their powerful sense of smell. Canines can detect poop from hundreds of yards away, and find four times more samples than using other methods... The canines can detect up to 18 species and differentiate between two animals with similar looking feces."

The review, released Thursday, was conducted by a task force of scientists appointed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

About the only conclusion the task force could draw from the surveys was that mandatory waiting periods reduced gun suicides in people over 55.

"When a four-year-old boy called Kalien met <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/music/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a>, he just didn't know what to make of him. ... The 45-year-old singer's complexion drew gasps at the charity event in Beverly Hills. ... An onlooker said: <i>'It looked as if he'd dunked his face in a bowl of talcum powder. ... It's hard to believe Michael Jackson used to be a black man. Now he looks like a very odd white woman.'</i>
