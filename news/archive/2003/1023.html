"A former Navy attorney who helped lead the military investigation of the 1967 Israeli attack on the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/espionage/uss-liberty/">USS <i>Liberty</i></a> that killed 34 American servicemen says former President Lyndon Johnson and his defense secretary, Robert McNamara, ordered that the inquiry conclude the incident was an accident. In a signed affidavit released at a Capitol Hill news conference, retired Capt. Ward Boston said Johnson and McNamara told those heading the Navy's inquiry to 'conclude that the attack was a case of "mistaken identity" despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.' Boston was senior legal counsel to the Navy's original 1967 review of the attack. He said in the sworn statement that he stayed silent for years because he's a military man, and 'when orders come... I follow them.'"

"With $245 billion in revenues in 2002, <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/crime/corporate/wal-mart/">Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</a> is the world's largest company. It is three times the size of the No. 2 retailer, France's Carrefour. Every week, 138 million shoppers visit Wal-Mart's 4,750 stores; last year, 82% of American households made at least one purchase at Wal-Mart... In household staples such as toothpaste, shampoo, and paper towels, the company commands about 30% of the U.S. market, and analysts predict that its share of many such goods could hit 50% before decade's end. Wal-Mart also is Hollywood's biggest outlet, accounting for 15% to 20% of all sales of CDs, videos, and DVDs. The mega-retailer did not add magazines to its mix until the mid-1990s, but it now makes 15% of all single-copy sales in the U.S. In books, too, Wal-Mart has quickly become a force... 28% of Dial total sales, 24% of Del Monte Foods', 23% of Clorox's, 23% of Revlon's, and on down the list. Suppliers' growing dependence on Wal-Mart is 'a huge issue' not only for manufacturers but also for the U.S. economy, says Tom Rubel, CEO of consultant Retail Forward Inc. <i>'If</i> [Wal-Mart] <i>ever stumbles, we've got a potential national security problem on our hands. They touch almost everything.'"</i>

"The phenomenon of gang rape in France has become banal. It occurs - how often is unknown - in the concrete wastelands built as cheap housing for immigrants on the outskirts of France's big cities. Here, according to sociologists and prosecutors, teenage boys, many of them loosely organized into gangs, prey on neighborhood girls... To avoid trouble, many girls of the projects have taken to wearing loose-fitting jogging clothes and hidden themselves behind domineering fathers or brothers; others have organized themselves into their own gangs."

Two of the students who overheard the exchange are black. Realizing she had said something inappropriate, the teacher immediately apologized, Kennedy Principal Vivienne Paratore said.

"For one night only, they will be the stars in front of hundreds of spectators. But after the curtain falls, finalists in this national singing contest will return to their packed cells and grim prison camps... Prisoners will get to strut their stuff at a concert at the Olympiisky Village concert hall Friday, hoping that a lucky one or two may walk away with a prize more valuable than those on Fame Academy: freedom... Officials say that more than one prisoner may be released, but only those who are eligible for parole."
