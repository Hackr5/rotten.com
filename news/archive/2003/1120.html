"International lawyers and anti-war campaigners reacted with astonishment yesterday after the influential Pentagon hawk <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/richard-perle/">Richard Perle</a> conceded that the invasion of Iraq had been illegal... Mr Perle told an audience in London: 'I think in this case international law stood in the way of doing the right thing.' President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">George Bush</a> has consistently argued that the war was legal either because of existing UN security council resolutions on Iraq - also the British government's publicly stated view - or as an act of self-defence permitted by international law. But Mr Perle, a key member of the defence policy board, which advises the US defence secretary, <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/donald-rumsfeld/">Donald Rumsfeld</a>, said that 'international law ... would have required us to leave <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam Hussein</a> alone,' and this would have been morally unacceptable."

"Gov. Mitt Romney is leading the charge for civil unions, which would bestow certain rights to gay couples but deny marriage licenses... In a brew of mixed messages, the governor vowed to push a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage onto the 2006 ballot, even as he works with lawmakers over the next six months to create a civil union law he claims would satisfy the Supreme Judicial Court... The governor indicated he had to hold his nose in voicing his newfound support for civil unions, saying he'd rather not provide full benefits to gays at all - but admitting there's no way around it... Gay rights advocates pointed to the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that desegregated schools by striking down the 'separate but equal' doctrine."

"An appeals court this week put the brakes on an <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/conspiracy/fbi/">FBI</a> surveillance technique that turns an automobile driver's on-board vehicle navigation system into a covert eavesdropping device... The feature, designed to listen-in on car thieves as they cruise around in a stolen auto, turns on a dashboard microphone and pipes conversations out over a cellphone connection... Under federal law, the FBI can obtain court orders compelling telecommunications companies, ISPs, landlords and others to assist the Bureau in spying on customers. But the law requires that surveillance in such cases be conducted 'unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with the services' provided by the company. With the navigation system's cellular link dedicated full time to eavesdropping, the system had no way to communicate with the company's response center if the roadside assistance or emergency reporting features were activated."

"We bought thong underwear at two Victoria's Secret stores, and at Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomindale's... Every store took back our thongs without the tags, never asking if they'd been worn. Next our hidden camera caught the sales clerk at a Victoria's Secret attaching a new price tag on our returned thong, hanging it up and then putting it back on the floor for sale... Microbiologist Dr. Lori Daane says dangerous bacteria like yeast and <i>E. coli</i> can survive for weeks on lingerie and can be easily transferred. 'Given the fact that you can get these organisms on this clothing, especially thong underwear, it's pretty likely you're going to get some fecal contamination.'"

"A test of state agencies has revealed that people seeking public records have about a 60 percent chance of getting what they are legally entitled to and often face improper questioning... Many requests were met with questions, such as who wanted the information, why they wanted it and who the requester worked for. The state law bars such questions. Surveyors seeking teacher decertification records, driving records and restaurant inspection reports were among those who faced rigorous questioning from state workers."
