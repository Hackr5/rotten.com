"A woman called Laweel was told that she and 10 others were to be made an example of as a way of warning the community not to fight the rebels. ... Kidnapped children were told to sharpen the knives and machetes laid there, and one by one the women had their noses, lips and ears cut off. Then they were made to eat their own flesh. I tried to keep looking at Laweel as I spoke to her, so as not to offend her, but it was really hard. Her disfigurement is so appalling that your mind instantly conjures up images of the event. It must be the worst part of it all that now, as she goes through her life, people look they other way."

Senior Japanese politician Takami Eto made the suggestion while giving a speech in the west of Japan. ... In his speech on Saturday, Mr Eto also criticised past prime ministers for apologising for Japan's role in the war and making it appear that Japan was in the wrong... In response, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said: 'The Nanjing Massacre was a brutal crime committed by the Japanese militarists during their invasion war with China for which there is a mountain of ironclad evidence.'"

Last year, for example, the administration stopped issuing a monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics report, known as the Mass Layoff Statistics program, that tracked factory closings throughout the country. ... The administration deep-sixed a study commissioned by then Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill that predicts huge budget deficits well into the future. ... The annual Adverse Effect Wage Rate establishes the minimum wage that can be paid each year to about 50,000 agricultural 'guest workers' in the H2A Program. ... in 2001, DOL withheld the wage figure until August, and only published it after the Farmworker Justice Fund threatened a lawsuit.

A new biography of the famous actress contains "several memorable moments of weirdness. The night that <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/music/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a> went to dinner in Hepburn's Manhattan residence, for example. In her speak-my-mind fashion, she told him that he wore sunglasses too much, so he took them off. Jackson told Berg that Hepburn was his favourite actress. But when Berg asked him to name his favourite Hepburn movie. Jackson could not name one. In fact, as Berg ticked off one after another of her great films, it became excruciatingly obvious that Jackson was not familiar with any of them."

"The sister of Stuart Sutcliffe, the 'fifth Beatle,' is to make public startling new evidence that strengthens her claim that his death was caused by a kick to the head from John Lennon. Pauline Sutcliffe, who believes her brother was beaten up by Lennon in the months before he died, is to sell off a huge archive containing a sketchbook that indicates a rapid decline in his mental health after the alleged incident. ... The black book -- dated to October 1961, after the alleged Lennon fight -- contains a series of barely legible scrawls and pained exclamations apparently reflecting Sutcliffe's gradual mental collapse. ... Ms Sutcliffe wrote: 'I believe that the cerebral haemorrhage that cost Stuart his life was caused by an injury inflicted by John in a jealous rage.'"

"An estimated 25 million automobiles in the United States -- almost every newer GM car -- now have so-called event data recorders, a scaled-down version of the devices that monitor cockpit activity in airplanes. What the devices record increasingly finds its way into courtrooms, leading some privacy advocates to question how the recorders came to be installed so widely with so little public notice. ... Most people apparently don't even know whether the vehicles they drive are equipped with event data recorders. Nearly two-thirds of people surveyed by an insurance industry group knew nothing about them."
