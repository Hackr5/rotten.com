"United States soldiers at a prison outside Baghdad have been accused of forcing Iraqi prisoners into acts of sexual humiliation and other abuses... Some of the photographs, and descriptions of others, were broadcast in the US on Wednesday by a CBS television news program and were verified by military officials... The program reported that poorly trained US reservists were forcing Iraqis to conduct simulated sexual acts in order to break down their will before they were turned over to others for interrogation.. 'The pictures show Americans, men and women, in military uniforms, posing with naked Iraqi prisoners,' a transcript said. 'And in most of the pictures, the Americans are laughing, posing, pointing or giving the camera a thumbs-up.' ... The photographs were taken inside Abu Ghraib prison, near Baghdad, where US forces have been holding hundreds of Iraqis."

The St. Johns County medical examiner on Wednesday said she died of natural causes at least five days before she was found. Doshier's daughter Alicia, who officials said is in her mid-30s, has been questioned and hospitalized for psychiatric observation. She was found in the store Tuesday, 13 hours after security cameras spotted her parking the car and entering the store at about midnight Monday... Receipts in the car indicated the daughter drove through Texas and North Carolina before reaching Florida, O'Brien said. The woman said she talked to the body during the trip, he said."

"A construction crew's backhoe tumbled down a hillside onto a school bus on the highway below in Colombia, killing 21 children and two adults and injuring 36 others, officials said. The 45-ton earth mover was being driven along a section of road higher up the hill when it rolled off a ledge and plunged about 70 feet before crushing the bus on the highway below... About a hundred emergency workers and police used heavy machinery to try to clear the mangled wreckage and get to the children - ages 7 to 12 - trapped inside."

"For Terrell Embry, Tuesday's verdict was harder to swallow than the 26 packets of crack cocaine he ingested four years ago. The 19-year-old Bridgeport drug dealer rushed out of federal court just seconds after a jury cleared Bridgeport Hospital, a former administrator and two surgeons of violating his constitutional rights by conducting an emergency operation to remove some of the swallowed drugs. With Senior U.S. District Judge Peter C. Dorsey still on the bench and the eight-member jury still in the box, Embry stood up, motioned to his girlfriend and stormed out of the courthouse. 'He's disappointed,' said John R. Williams, Embry's lawyer. 'I think that his own admission [of] being a professional drug dealer didn't help.' ... Embry was brought to the hospital in April 2000 by Bridgeport police after he swallowed at least 26 small packets of crack cocaine during his arrest."

After he shouted at the boy, Palafox went down to the deli to retrieve the dried beef, cops said.

"The <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> administration has stripped information on a range of women's issues from government Web sites, apparently in pursuit of a political agenda, researchers reported on Wednesday... A council report said the missing information fell into four categories: women's health; their economic status; objective scientific data; and information aimed at protecting women and girls and helping them advance. The deletions and alterations appear to hew to a political agenda, rather than providing the nonpartisan, unbiased data that has been the tradition of U.S. government reports, the council said... The National Cancer Institute's Web site was changed in 2002 to say studies linking <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/death/abortion/">abortion</a> and breast cancer were inconsistent; after an outcry from scientists, the institute later amended that to say abortion is not associated with increased breast cancer risk."

[<i>So what else is new?</i>] ABC News plans to devote Friday's entire <i>Nightline</i> segment to the tribute, with anchor Ted Koppel reading aloud the names of hundreds of fallen American servicemen and women as their photographs are shown. The network's intentions drew a denunciation from Sinclair, a Baltimore-based owner of 62 television stations in 39 markets reaching roughly 24 percent of U.S. television households. Sinclair said the <i>Nightline</i> segment 'appears to be motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the United States in Iraq.'"

'I'm outraged and angry. I can't believe that such a show will go on,' he told Reuters. The Israeli-born spoon bender, who now lives in Britain, began his book in 2001, publishing chapters weekly on a subscription Internet Web site. It has not yet been printed... Geller said he was friends with the show's host Barbara Walters and was puzzled why she had decided to do it... He [also] counts embattled pop star <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/music/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a>, who is facing trial over child molestation charges, as a personal friend."
