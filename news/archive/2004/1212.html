"A group of Israeli soldiers serving in the Gaza Strip have reportedly admitted killing a 15-year-old Palestinian in Khan Yunus for sport. According to the Israeli newspaper <i>Yediot Ahronoth</i>, the incident took place in March when a group of newly graduated soldiers were on a hike near the town of Khan Yunus. According to the report, an undisclosed number of Givati brigade soldiers shot and killed Khalid Sulaiman Mahdi while he was working with his father on their farm... According to soldiers interviewed by <i>Yediot Ahronoth</i>, there were no operational purposes for the shooting and no justification, since the boy and his family posed no threat to the soldiers. An Israeli army spokesman said the army had investigated the incident, but admitted that no arrests were made."

Her birth defect is called <a href="http://www.treachercollins.org/" target="_blank">Treacher Collins Syndrome</a>. Doctors say it's the worst case they've ever seen... Juliana has to eat through her stomach, and she has a trach to breathe. Already, less than two years into her life, she's had 14 surgeries. Doctors say she could need at least 30 more. Every time she goes to the hospital, doctors make a mold of her head, and then reconstruct her skull to figure out the next step."

And all he could think about was saving his wedding ring... At a field hospital, doctors were going to cut the ring from his finger to save as much of the digit as they could... Battle told them not to cut the ring but around it so it could be saved even if it meant losing his finger. And that's what the doctors did... But the ring is now gone. When Battle returned to the United States and opened his packages from the base camp hospital where his finger was amputated, the ring was missing.
