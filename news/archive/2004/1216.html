"A Mexican accused of killing, cooking and <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/death/cannibalism/">eating</a> his companion acknowledged having committed the crime and said the victim 'tasted like lamb.' 'If they'd let me, I would have eaten it all,' said Gumaro de Dios Arias... He said he killed the victim – identified only as El Guacho – because the man had failed to buy Arias drugs with money he had given him for that purpose. Afterward, Arias apparently tried to make a vegetable stew with portions of the body, but didn't like it, so instead he began to roast sections of the corpse, police said. 'I ate about 2.5 kilograms,' Arias said. 'It tasted very good.' Arias was apparently under the effects of sniffing glue when he allegedly killed the man by hitting him in the head with a blunt object; the body was missing slices from its legs and internal organs when found hanging from the rafters of a hut."

"A San Jose woman told police, 'I am a bad person. I murdered my baby,' after her 11-month-old son was scalded by 130-degree bath water, a prosecutor said Wednesday. Robin Graham, 19, of 300 N. First St. pleaded guilty Wednesday in Logan County Circuit Court to first-degree murder in the death of Austin Graham. She faces up to 60 years in prison... [Prosecutor Tim Huyett] said police questioned Graham after her son was taken in an ambulance and she told them she 'should be shot' and also said, 'I am a bad person. I murdered my baby. Take me to jail.' ... Graham told police she killed the boy because she was 'upset with him for messing his pants,' Huyett said. She said after she placed him in a baby seat in the bathtub and started running the scalding water, his eyes looked 'glazed over, like he was in shock.' She said she expected him to kick out of the seat and drown, not burn to death."

"A 16-year-old 'gentle giant' was sexually assaulted, punched, kicked, burned and struck with stones until he died at the hands of his young friends... [Robbie McLennan] pleaded for his life, court heard, throughout three hours of torture... A pathologist determined Robbie died from a blow to the head but that the six-foot-tall teen, who was known to friends as a 'gentle giant' could have died from the kicks to his head or the stoning alone. More than 40 distinct areas of injury were found on the body, and death ensued over a matter of hours, court heard... [One defendant] sexually abused Robbie repeatedly and forced him to perform sex acts on others. The female accused kicked him so hard in the groin that she ruptured a testicle. She stomped on his face with such force that it left a clear shoe impression on his forehead. The next day, police found his body with five distinct cigarette burns and two bloodied rocks, weighing nine and 12.7 kilograms."

"Ernest Averiett didn't hold anything back when he took the witness stand in his own behalf Wednesday. He revealed a sordid saga of how a woman known only as 'Lips' took the drug ecstasy with his girlfriend and all three had sex last August before the two women fought the next day. The fight resulted in burns from a clothes iron over 40% of the body of Jonelle Wynn, 22, he said... Averiett faces a charge of felonious assault, two counts of digital rape, kidnapping and intimidation of a witness based on a statement that he threatened Wynn not to report the torture while holding a meat fork to her throat inside his car while driving her to a Youngstown hospital... Averiett said the car he drove Wynn to the hospital in Aug. 16 was stolen and it happened to have a handicapped sticker in it, so he parked in a handicapped spot."

"A floral foul-up has left a city street lined with <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/imagery/swastika/">swastika</a> shapes in a week of major Jewish celebrations. Gardeners hired by Melbourne City Council intended to arrange the purple and white pot plants into neat geometric shapes. But they left six 3m garden beds along Swanston St displaying large Nazi symbols. Jewish community representatives were appalled last night by the timing of the blunder. City venues including Federation Square are hosting hundreds of Jews this week to celebrate the eight-day Hanukkah festival... Vandals were initially believed to have rearranged the plants as a racist slur. But closer investigation showed gardeners had inadvertently used the pattern."
