Sylvia Paterson and John Holmes (not the dead porn star with the
huge schlong) have been convicted of hiring a clown named "Banjo"
to disappear their stepson Paul and his wife Sarah. Both were
sentenced to nine years for conspiracy to murder, by a court in
Carrwood, Cheshire UK. Verdict on clowns however: still evil.

A dead and four months premature baby born at Mary Hospital in Torrance 
CA was accidentally sent out to the cleaning service, wrapped in laundry. 
The baby died approximately an hour after delivery; the mother
was informed the baby was alive but something was wrong, and it was
taken from her room. But one day after being discharged, the mother
received a phonecall informing her of the baby's mysterious reappearance 
at the Bellwood Linen and Supplies Company. The parents of <i>Baby Amina</i>
learned further details from television, which must surely have 
made them feel super good.

Louis G. Vitagliano has been ordered to pay $59,000
to official Baltimore Orioles mascot John J. Krownapple,
after he threw him from the stands into the outfield.
Additional punishment includes a year of probation and
100 hours community service. The manbird broke his ankle
during the fall. Also we might mention, that one year
ago, Miramax purchased the option to the screenplay 
<i>Bird Meets Girl</i>, to be directed by and star Jon
Stewart, about the love affair between the Orioles Mascot
and a sports reporting female. We haven't heard much
about this project for the last year, though apparently
they will now need a stuntman.

The Swedish Hotel Workers Federation is asking that its

atmosphere surrounding the viewing of hardcore pornographic
films in hotels that they clean. This is a direct quote
from the wire report, transcribed from Aftonbladet Daily --
"We have to dry off sticky television screens and clean stained 
sheets as well as picking up used tissues thrown under beds".
The organization also would like maids to be allowed to work
in pairs, in hotels showing hardcore porn. [Editor's note:

A daycare center in Boston, Massachusetts has lost its license
because of various abuses, the most interesting of which was the
duct taping an 8 month old girl to the wall, in an experiment 
to determine whether duct tape "works on everything". [Note:
it does.] The man who allegedly taped the infant was the 
director of the center, name not divulged, but has since been 
fired by the owner of <i>A Place to Grow</i>, who is appealing 
the loss of license last week. <i>Now with 102 uses!</i>

According to Taz, many members of Vienna's gay scene are ready to confirm
the reports. They claim he regularly has sex with young men below the age of
consent - 18 for homosexuals. 
<p>
As a result, says Taz: "These days he prefers to meet with boys from nearby
Slovakia" (where the age of consent is 15). The paper also refers to Mr Haider's
alleged cocaine habit. 
<p>
According to Taz, Haider's current partner is a youthful member of the Freedom
party who has worked as his private secretary.

Now we don't have problems with shennanigans such as these, provided
they are legal. But we do have problems when a self-confessed <b>bigot</b>
engages in behavioral hypocrisy. Someone who praises Adolf Hitler from
one side of his mouth should probably not be sucking cock with the other 
side. Haider was essentially forced to resign from his party post because 
his presence as an influence in the Austrian government was causing Austria 
itself to be ostracised from EU reindeer games.

A bareass naked man wearing only a shirt, later identified

truck, in Clearwater TX on March 21. The hijacker first wallowed 
in the garbage part of the truck and then later removed the driver 
from the truck and drove it off. He continued his crime spree
with the invasion of a hotel room and an attempted hijacking
of a semitrailer. It seems almost as if Mr. Childs has issues.

<b>Killer Spits Out Keys at Execution</b>

Convicted killer Ponchai Wilkerson was executed by lethal injection 
at Huntsville TX, yesterday, but soon after he was given the injection
the condemned man spat out a universal handcuff and leg restraint key.
Prior to his execution Wilkerson struggled with officials, and had
to be maced; on February 21 he actually escaped from death row and held 
a guard hostage for half a day. Wilkerson was sentenced to death for
the 1990 murder of a jewelry store employee, whom he shot point blank.
Prison officials are currently investigating how the key was obtained.

The National Security Agency (American spooks) and GCHQ
(Limey spooks) were concerned that direct satellite phones were
very difficult to tap. Well, that is no longer an issue! Motorola
has applied for patents to make Iridium and Teledesic super
easy for TLA's (Three Letter Agencies) to listen to. Problem 
was, to intercept a call, it would have to go to satellite, down
to a station, and then back up to satellite. That added so much
time and noise, that any idiot would know his phone was tapped.
The new patents support direct communication, but beam an
on-demand voice stream to a TLA listening post, containing
a replica or excerpts from conversations, as appropriate. What
exactly possessed Motorola to think consumers wanted this 
"feature", we aren't quite sure of. Bastards.

<b>Pantsless Sex Counsellor Arrested at 7-Eleven</b>

<table cellspacing=7 cellpadding=7>
<tr>

A Valparaiso, Indiana sex counsellor was arrested at 7-Eleven
minimart in a pantsless condition, his sole article of clothing
being a football jersey. Apparently Matias Reinaldo Jr.,
a psychologist, was to meet his "internet girlfriend" in the 
parking lot, and her instructions were to meet him naked. 
A customer noticed Mr. Reinaldo's lack of pantitude and notified
police, and the good psychologist was booked for indecency.
The pathetic 40 year old has taken a much needed leave of absence 
from his sex counselling job.

<b>Swedish Mother Breastfeeds Puppies</b>
</font>
</center>
<p>
<table cellspacing=7 cellpadding=7>
<tr>

Casja Holmstr&ouml;m, age 30, helped five puppies into life. Literally. When their 
mother wouldn't produce any milk, she breast fed them. "It's your duty to be 
there in any way you can", she says. The Holmstr&ouml;m family in Glommerstr&auml;sk outside 
Arvidsjaur has sheep, cows, cats and dogs on their farm. On November 6, their 
neighbor's dog Amy, pregnant by the Holmstr&ouml;m's dog Solo, gave birth to five 
puppies. Shortly after the birth Amy stopped producing milk, and everyone thought 
the puppies would die because of it. This was when Cajsa Holmstr&ouml;m came up 
with her rather unorthodox solution. Since she was already breastfeeding her
son Markus, age one, she thought that perhaps her own breastmilk could save the puppies. 
"It was the most natural thing in the world. You do whatever you can to save the 
animals around you." For one week Cajsa took on the role as the puppies' mother. 
The dog Amy watched the entire process. "I got the feeling she was grateful because I 
helped her", she says.
