<b>Dr. Laura to Start Fall TV Talkshow</b>

Dr. Laura Schlessinger, noted radio talk show host and author
of several books of largely bad advice, will receive a Paramount TV
talk show in Fall, entertainment industry sources have reported.   
For this she is receiving $3M, after a CBS deal ended a non-starter
apparently because Howard Stern is associated with that syndicator.
Dr. Laura credits include <i>Ten Stupid Things Women Do To Mess Up 
Their Lives</i> (one of which must surely include posing nude,
see photo to right taken by her then-married boyfriend.)

<b>Man Hides Jap Schoolgirl for Ten Years</b>

Abduction charges have been filed against Nobuyuki Sato, of 
Kashiwazaki Japan. A decade ago he kidnapped a nine year
old Japanese schoolgirl at a baseball game, fed her, clothed her,
and probably did evil things to her. This behavior may not be
all that unusual in Japan, we hear. But the truly odd thing about
this story is that Sato lived with his mother, who while 
disavowing knowledge of the fact that a girl lived in her house 
for <i>ten years</i>, "suspected" something was afoot.

<i>This is complicated.</i> In Philadelphia, Frederick Clark (age 27) killed his

Tyrone Nixon (age 56). Clark had been raised by, and was living with and supported

A while back we received a rather interesting video, anthea.mpg 
("Anthea Hit By Motorcycle"), without any other explanation. Well, 
diligent research has revealed that it is a training video dating 
to 1990, with <b>Anthea Turner</b>, but it was not actually staged to
occur in the manner it does. A staged flash explosion is set off,
igniting poor Anthea unintentionally, and she falls off the truck
she was positioned on. Anthea suffered second degree burns, but 
sued for damages and won.

The grandmother of Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban boy which Fidel Castro

We presume the latter.

This seems to be pretty much standard behavior for a grandmother in Cuba,

on January 27 from a ranch in Waukena, California. The suspect,
Antemio Lopez, remains at large. Apparently there is a bull 
semen blackmarket, as it is required for milk cows to begin producing 
their milk, in addition to the expected reproductive purposes.

We've been presented with this alarming visual evidence that
the male role in society may soon be obsolete. We are disturbed
that something so precious to us, our very cocks, might be rendered
superfluous by this so-called "industrial revolution". But 
nevertheless, it's pornography, so enjoy this penetrating video.

<b>CIA Director Visited Porn Sites</b>

It has been revealed that former CIA director John Deutch, 
currently in a scandal because of bringing CIA secrets home on
an unsecured laptop computer, visited raunchy porn sites on
the Internet with that very same computer. It has not been
made public what sites were visited, or what fetishes Deutch
has, or what his wife thinks of all this. He blames
"another family member", but then this raises a worse
issue, that of a noncleared individual having access to the 
reams of highly confidential and sensitive data on the laptop system.

Rands, founder of the popular web comic strip 
<a href="http://www.jerkcity.com/" target=_blank>Jerkcity</a>, narrowly averted
death on Monday during a routine trip from Seattle/Tacoma to San Jose 
via Alaskan Airlines. Flight 280, which stops in San Jose enroute to 
Puerto Vallarta, was the same plane as Flight 261, which plunged into 
the Pacific Ocean later that same day, killing all 88 passengers on 
board. Commented Rands, "HUGALUGLGALGLUG." [Editor's note: This is entirely true.
We wish Rands luck and many glorious cocksucking years to come.]

The <i>Spice Girls</i> have won the Lifetime Achievement Award
at this year's Brit Awards, the UK's sad version of the Grammies.
What better way to recognize four agonizing years in music,
the highs and the lows, of an exceptionally talented band. 
Also, on the controversial bulimia issue, Posh Spice has this to say:
"We were out at dinner the other day and I was absolutely bursting 
for the toilet and it's quite sad to think you can't even go to 
the toilet because if you do, people are going to think you're throwing up." 
We can think of no finer choice.

Colorado College is replacing its admissions exams with a 
Lego test, aimed at colored applicants who perform poorly on
standardized tests. The lego test, part of a battery of 14 
nontraditional tests, evaluates group communication and 
leadership qualities by asking clusters of 8-10 applicants to 
duplicate a robot. There is no word on the university's
potty requirements for admission; hopefully they have not
been relaxed as well.

<b>The NFL Menace</b>

A crime wave by NFL players continues this week
with yesterday's arrest of Ray Lewis, Baltimore linebacker,
in Atlanta for a murder after the Superbowl. This comes after the
arrest of Rae Carruth, a Carolina Panthers wide receiver, who
allegedly shot his knocked-up girlfriend in a drive-by 
shooting. And not to mention numerous drug, assault, and
other charges racked up by NFL players over the last few
years. It is high time that NFL be considered a gang under
the law and players be prosecuted under the various gang statutes
in each state. Additionally, federal prosecutions ought to occur 
under RICO (Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) laws,
the very laws used to prosecute Mafia and other crime organizations.
We will not be safe until our streets are removed of this evil.

The esteemed publication <i>Sun</i> is reporting that the Crown of
Thorns of Jesus Christ was found near Aleppo, on the bank of the 
Euphrates river in Babylonia, now Syria. The crown, found in a tomb 
dating to 1189, is attributed to one Raoul de Marmande, Templar Knight, 
and an acacia thorn crown in "perfect condition" was resting next to 
the deceased.  What is not explained is how this crown is attributed 
to Jesus, how some random Templar found it 1150 years after the death 
of the Savior, or why nobody's heard of this ever before. <i>Huzzah!</i>
