<b>St. Tibb's Day All But Forgotten</b>

<tr>

Today marks the occasional celebration of <b>St. Tibb's Day</b>,
which appears on the Discordian Calendar between <i>59 Chaos</i> and 
<i>60 Chaos</i>, or <i>February 29</i>, Gregorian. According to Robert 
Anton Wilson, "everybody now agrees that St. Tibb never existed." 
We cannot see how he can jump to such a conclusion. Clearly the 16th 
century copperplate engraving here strengthens our case.

<b>German Cocks Not So Glorious</b>

<p>
Your report on the Daily Rotten that "A study has reported that German
condoms are not large enough for glorious German cocks" is incorrect.  In
fact, it was found that the condoms were too big for german cocks, as given
by the Reuters press release [...]
</font>
<p>
We stand corrected, the German Volk are indeed smaller in the manhood
department than we previously reported. We issue a <b>retraction</b>.
<p>
<b>Details:</b> Condomi produced the study, demonstrating that EN600
(EU document produced by physicians, in 1996), issued regulations for thick
penii, whereas those in the Fatherland are 3.5-4mm narrower. It is
thus a matter of thin wieners. (Focus Magazine).

was damaged during the attack, receiving a good sized dent. It is

Detroit attack by her husband on one of her opponents, Nancy Kerrigan, 
in 1994, wherein she was stripped of her U.S. title.

I take issue and demand a correction on your supposed prostitution people of 
Minneapolis. The web site you link to is actually St. Paul. In minneapolis, 
we have beautiful streetwalkers, pimps, and Johns. 
<p>
The two cities are also not one in the same or twins as the name twin cities 
imply, in minneapolis, we have a stupid black lady as mayor, in St. paul they 
have a carpet bagging Kennedy wannabe from Boston named Norm "sucks" Coleman. 
We minneapolites do not want to be associated with St Pauleans. Besides they 
are a bunch of drunken irish men.

Sex has been tried in space, both on the American space shuttle

Pierre Kohler, astronomer and historian, claims that documents

demonstrate a gauntlet of ten tests of sexual positions and
variations, performed inside an inflatable tunnel for privacy.

Kohler also claims that female British astronaut Helen Sharman
fucked four cosmonauts in 1991 aboard the Mir space station,
and that cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaia sex'd several cosmonauts
on the Salyut-7 station in 1982. They got the U.S. beat there,
unless John Glenn wanked or something on his mission.

Dr. Bruce O'Dell, a dermatologist in Show Low, AZ, has been charged 
with drinking the urine of a number of his teenage boy patients. According to 
papers filed with the court, it appears the good doctor would convince his 
various boy patients that vitamins in their urine would keep him healthy,
and youthful. O'Dell may have engaged in other unsavory activities with
them as well, and his license to practice medicine may be revoked.
[For the record, urine contains no vitamins of any note, and is entirely
too salty for our tastes.]

According to <i>The Globe</i>, admittedly a rather sleazy supermarket
tabloid, actor <i>Don Johnson</i> is a big gay homosexual. On a 1998
trip to a San Francisco video store, accompanied by a 20ish boy, the actor 
rented "Cop Daddies Playtime", and "Asian Studs", spent $130 on dildonica, 
and purchased various harness toys, for a grand total over $600. Oddly,
purchases included a blowup doll of <i>Christy Canyon</i>, a female porn
star, so we haven't quite figured Don out. In any event, they gave the
actor a chance to respond, he claimed these purchases were for a bachelor
party. No word on what the boy was for. [BTW, those videos are awful.]

The cop who arrested George Michael has lost a $10M emotional

did not like a video that depicted french kissing cops, uniformed
dancing men, and other unspecified toilet shenanigans. The lawsuit was
dismissed because Rodriguez is a public official, and thereby subject
to all manner of ridicule. You will of course recall that Michael was 
arrested in April 1998 for wanking in front of Rodriguez, an 
undercover police officer, thereby making the singer subject to
all manner of public ridicule as well.

The end of January saw the conviction of 
<b>Dr. Harold Frederick Shipman</b>, Manchester area family

patients. A rather strong disliking to about 150 of them. The 
conviction only covered about ten percent of these, all murdered
with morphine, but Shipman long had a very high death rate and
prodigious prescriptions of the narcotic issued by his hand.
His antics exceed those of other English serial killers:
Dennis Nilson (killed 16 homosexuals); Yorkshire Ripper 
(killed 13 women with hand tools); Jack the Ripper (not even on
the charts.) Only time will tell if anyone has the testicular
fortitude to top this feat of English persistence.

The Broadcasting Standards Authority of New Zealand ruled yesterday that
video shown of a penis stapling to a crucifix is not in bad taste. The 
college student in question, Thomas Hendry, stapled his penis and scrotum
to a white pine crucifix and lit it afire during a broadcast of <i>How Far Will 
You Go?</i>, in Christchurch NZ. Said Hendry after the performance,
"I got a bit carried away and used 18 staples, 10 through the scrotum. It
was a wee bit tender the next day." His mother, in the audience, commented
"My son is a grown man and he wanted to do it." I suppose. The television station 
in question is state owned, and we must applaud them for this, while simultanously
questioning Hendry's sanity. And no, we haven't received the video for this.
