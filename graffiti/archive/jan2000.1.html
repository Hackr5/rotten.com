<b>No More Goat Tossing</b>

<table cellspacing=7 cellpadding=7>
<tr>
<td>
Under pressure from the Spanish government, the annual practice
of throwing a goat from the town's bell tower will be stopped.
The ceremony, necessary to open the festival of St Vincent,
has been held for centuries on January 23. Legend holds that a
goat in the bell tower was saved when villages caught it in
a blanket, but it is not clear how the goat arrived atop the
bell tower in the first place.

<b>Wacky Turks Self Immolate</b>

To express their dismay at the fact that the Kurdish leader
Abdullah Ocalan, currently under death penalty, has yet to be 
executed, the mother and brother of two dead Turkish Army 
soldiers <b>lit themselves afire</b> during a demonstration in Istanbul.
The two self-immolators were admitted in serious condition to Haseki 
Hospital. Execution of Ocalan, sentenced to be hanged, is 
under review by the European Court of Human Rights and it is 
expected that his death sentence will be ruled inappropriate.

Ben Stein, television host of Comedy Central's hit game show "Win Ben 
Stein's Money", was robbed of his money at gunpoint on January 5 while 
entering his Beverly Hills home. Stolen from Stein was approximately 
$1000 and his various credit cards. This is indeed an outrage. Police 
are investigating. [Extra Fun Fact: The money on the game show, billed
as Ben's, actually belongs to the studio. Say it ain't so!]

A hemisphere of a human brain has been discovered in a Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania sewage plant. As no brains have been reported missing in the
area, the discovery remains a mystery. It is most probable that the 
brain was flushed down some toilet, and it does not appear the brain was used
at any point for medical research. The hemisphere is mostly intact and
largely well preserved; the county coroner is investigating.

<b>Glamrocker Gary Glitter out of Jail...!</b>
</font>
</center>
<p>
<table cellspacing=7 cellpadding=7>
<tr>
<td>
Gary Glitter was released from Horfield Prison
in the UK yesterday, after serving two of his four
months for a child pornography conviction.
Glitter is best known for his excellent anthem 
<i>Rock and Roll Part II</i>, and was one of the 
premiere "glam rock" artists of the 70's and 80's.
The artist was arrested in 1997 when he stupidly brought
a computer containing contraband images into a shop
for repair. Glitter, previously acquitted in 1980 
of unrelated underage sodomy charges, exhibits
remorse over these recent crimes and has expressed
an interest in moving to Cuba.

disgrace, and remains highly polluted.

Today the U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case brought under
the 1994 <i>Violence Against Women Act</i>, in which damages are sought
by Christy Brzonkala under federal law, against her rapist. 
Constitutionally, Congress only has the power to regulate interstate
commerce. This clause is often used to wedge the power of the
federal government into areas otherwise off limits constitutionally,
and its misuse has been rampant lately. But it should be very clear
to anyone that this statute, which incredulously considers rape to be 
interstate commerce, will be overturned on the grounds that no 
money changes hands.

<b>Deafs In Uproar Over Rotten Exhibit</b>

<tr>
<td>
A number of vocal deaf people are in a tizzy over rotten.com's
use of the "deaf alphabet" to number one of its exhibits,
featuring severed limbs. The creators of the site 
maintain that no harm was intended. "Deaf people 
complaining about this is much like Italian Americans 
complaining that we used Roman Numerals," said the designer
of the exhibit. "Rotten doesn't discriminate against any 
form of cripple. Both deafs and regulars alike are welcome," 
added Gweeds, another rotten.com staff member. "I think any 
potential lawsuits will be avoided thanks to the fact that 
rotten.com has always strictly adhered to the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. This is so incredibly whiny."

Transplant organs from executed prisoners in China
are being sold to wealthy Hong Kong patients, according
to a mainland Chinese newspaper story on January 9. The 
operations are performed at Sun Yat Sen University Hospital, 
apparently in violation of a directive issued by the Chinese
government ministry. More than 40 such operations have
occurred, with livers priced at approximately $25,000.
China tends to execute large numbers of prisoners before
major festivals, making more organs available around
those dates. No consent is required from the prisoner
for their "donations" of harvestable organs.

<b>Faelan Finished</b>

<img src="faelan.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

Since 1998 one of our favorite websites was that of <b>Faelan</b>,
billed as <i>"Cute 11 year-old boy holding contest to find girl to be 
sweetheart/girlfriend. For girls his age/younger looking for boyfriend..."</i>
The target age range for the sweetheart was 8-13, and nothing overtly
illegal was suggested. Some thought it a hoax, and others were convinced 
it was real. The site was surely too good to be real. But it was real! 
And now, Faelan and his two brothers are in a foster home, and the 
parents Jonathan and Sarah Aragorn have been convicted by a jury in Portland 
Oregon of various counts of child abuse and exploitation, based on the 
website posting. The investigation into this Faelan matter started 
with a TV news reporter's research, but the cards came down in Spring 1999 when 
an FBI agent posed as an interested father. <i>[Did anyone save a mirror of 
the contest site?]</i>

The Argentine edition of music magazine <b>Rolling Stone</b> is being

Tragedy ensued last April when a component of performance artist
<b>Zhang Huan</b>'s exhibit bit him in the heiney. The intent of 
this particular artistic expression was to represent man's biological 
stasis under the progress of technology, but canine stasis in the
presence of juicy, admittedly even floury ass was too much for the
animal to handle. It seems redundant to even state that these
events transpired in San Francisco.

The speaker of the Swaziland House of Assembly (parliament)
is being forced to resign because he collected cow manure

shit is used in various voodoo and witchcraft rituals,
particularly when such shit is owned by royalty. Swaziland,

A raving lunatic in San Francisco ran amok yesterday with a

Rioting erupted in the town of Whitefish, Montana, when four 
naked women streaked bare ass naked through the streets soon 
after midnight struck on New Year's Eve. Police estimate 400 
people were involved in the riot, of whom 12 men were arrested. 
Three of the naked ladies involved were also booked on 
indecency charges, the fourth remaining a fugitive from justice.

Fearing the new millenium, an unnamed prisoner at New Hampshire State 
Prison in Concord, New Hampshire, sewed his eyes and mouth shut with dental 
floss.  The effectiveness of such a strategy remains in question; the prisoner 
is currently being held to have his head examined.
