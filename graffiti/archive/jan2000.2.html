Four times as many Roman Catholic priests die of AIDS than in the
general population, according to a study reported by the Kansas City
Star. Furthermore, 20% of priests reported they like dick, although
a fourth of those who like dick also reported liking vagina. What the
study failed to report on was how much priests like altar boys 
(answer: oh very much so), and how celibate priests in general are 
(answer: not at all, apparently.) Does the Pope masturbate or does 
an assistant do it for him, a Papal Fluffer of sorts? Even during Lent?
<i>Amen.</i>

A member of the UK Parliament, Nigel Jones, is now out of the
hospital after a sword wielding attacker injured his hands, severing
a tendon and requiring 60 stitches. An associate, Andrew Pennington, 
was killed during the attack on St. George Street, in Cheltenaham. The 
attacker, one Robert Ashman also of Cheltenham, age 49, is currently 
in custody on murder charges. While this is all big news in the UK, 
nobody in the US has even heard of the attack. [We must wonder if gun 
control advocates are upset that no firearm was used in the incident.]

The sisters received the surgery as a gift from their 
father, which they had elected in lieu of travel to the

At a <i>Hello Kitty</i> product introduction in Bukit Panjang,
and two other cities across Malaysia yesterday, three men were 
arrested for rioting, an additional three for disorderly 
conduct, a policeman was injured from flying furniture, 
and another person was hospitalized. Hello Kitty is a cartoon
character owned by Sanrio Limited, a Japanese corporation, 
that legions of people somehow find amusing. The product openings
in Malaysia where rioting occurred were held at participating 
McDonald's Hamburger franchises, which have been scenes of violence 
earlier as well in Hong Kong. Oh the humanity.

This is perhaps the most extreme reaction to being arrested
that we have ever encountered. It is reproduced verbatim, simply because
we have trouble believing it. The man was only wanted on a warrant,
and seven men were required to subdue him. But he has a history apparently,
he tried to kill himself with a plastic spoon the last time he
was arrested.

Jannie Beukes, of Rustenberg South Africa, after killing his

Jannie has a destroyed face and is now charged with

The casino stayed open during and after the incident, which

Nutball groups at a conference on January 23 in Osaka, Japan have denied 
one of the largest massacres of the 20th century, the so called
<i>Rape of Nanking</i>. Estimates are that 140,000 to 300,000
civilians in the city were killed by Japanese occupiers during 1937-8,   
and that 20,000 women were raped. China has condemned the conference

contrarian beliefs continue. About 500 people protested the conference.

<b>Boners to be Criminalized</b>

A bill has been introduced in Mississippi to criminalize
the possession of aroused male genitalia. Yes, this means you
can't accidently get a boner in public without facing one year
in jail and a $2000 fine. Mind you, this is not nude genitalia, 
but <i>covered</i> genitalia, "discernably turgid", the fully 
tumescent yet discreet penis, as it were. [We are astonished that 
such a thing could happen even in a backwater like Mississippi. I 
suppose, that being 50th out of 50 in every category except mobile home 
parks, a state must constantly remain on the vigil or lose its place.
Kudos to Republican State Senator Tom King! -- Editor.]

Vice President Al Gore was a pothead for years, ending
only in 1976, according to a biography by Bill Turque featuring

house, we smoked in his parents' house, in my house; we smoked 
on weekends. We smoked a lot", Gore friend John C. Warnecke is 
quoted in an interview with Adam J. Smith. [Editor's note:
This information is only interesting in light of the hypocrisy
of the drug war, which Gore supports. Gore is an all around ass,
an intellectual lightweight, and certainly not anyone that

Drinking straws can be used to make free international telephone

Presumably in a misguided attempt to celebrate the millenium, 
porn actress Sabrina Johnson engaged in a marathon gangbang session
in which she was fucked consecutively by 2,000 horny gentlemen.
The session, which apparently occurred December 29-30, was
taped by Fleshtone Productions for the film <i>Gangbang of
the Millenium</i>, which no doubt will be the pinnacle of its
genre [Editor's note: yawn.] Unthinkably, Guinness refuses 
to recognize this category of artistic achivement as a 
legitimate record. Sabrina is described as "resting" currently.

"Because XENICAL works by blocking the absorption of dietary fat, it 
is likely that you will experience some changes in bowel habits. These 
generally occur during the first weeks of treatment; however, they 
may continue throughout your use of XENICAL. These changes may include 
oily spotting, gas with discharge, urgent need to go to the bathroom, 
oily or fatty stools, an oily discharge, increased number of bowel 
movements, and inability to control bowel movements. Due to the presence of
undigested fat, the oil seen in a bowel movement may be clear or have a 
coloration such as orange or brown."

The esteemed tabloid <i>Weekly World News</i> is reporting that vampire
war criminals in the former Yugoslavia may be responsible for the deaths 
of more than 240 people. Apparently, vampires are Serbs, and prey on
refugee Albanians fleeing ethnically cleansed areas. Furthermore, they
predicate that NATO has captured six of these "bloodsucking fiends", 
including one claiming an age of 600 years. [Editor's note: Certain 
members of our staff suspect WWN just made this stuff up. At least
<i>we</i> have some modicium of journalistic integrity.]

Ice balls that fell on Spain last week, which were thought to be
human excrement, are likely comet debris, according to Spanish 
scientist Enrique Martinez. One of the balls, a nine pounder,
damaged an automobile. It was not immediately known how 
top Spanish scientists failed to differentiate between poo and ice.

In September twenty-one pig heads were found impaled along
the road to Liverpool, UK. Nobody has claimed responsibility
for the placing of the heads, and police are baffled.
Pigheads of this type are often sold for use in sausage packing, 
and are not generally traceable.

Robert Thomas Cobabe was arrested on January 5
for standing in Horsetooth Mountain Park, Colorado
outhouse and videotaping women as they peed on him. 
A woman spotted the red light from his videocamera, 
and Cobabe initially escaped while wearing waders 
and other waterproof garb. He left his fingerprints 
behind however, and was caught later when applying 
for a state teaching license. Cobabe has been
charged with third degree sexual assault.
