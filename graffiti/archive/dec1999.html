<b>Y2K: Armageddon Cancelled?</b>

Underworld sources have leaked to our reporters that Armageddon
may in fact have been cancelled. According to Satan's minions, there
is an unfortunate lack of interest in "immediate gratification" forms
of evil topside, and not enough systems are crashing from the 
Millenium Bug. More to follow as this situation develops.
<p>
Update: A 200 foot high power transmission tower near Bend, OR was brought 
down by an act of sabotage this past evening. The line, known as the Pacific
Northwest-Pacific Southwest Direct Current Intertie, has been rerouted
and the FBI is investigating.

The <i>Weekly World News</i> is reporting the face of Satan
instantiating himself over the U.S. Capitol building in Washington,
D.C., this week. We should note that this is <i>not</i> the first time WWN
has reported immanentization of the apocalypse, as witnessed
<a href="wwn.html">by this surprising collage</a>.

<b>Least Talented Beatle Stabbed Repeatedly</b>
</font>
</center>
<p>
In a bold attempt to divide <i>The Beatles</i> equally between
the dead and undead, Beatle George Harrison was repeatedly stabbed
in the chest today, requiring hospitalization. Harrison, 56, is
widely regarded as the least talented Beatle, though many indicate
Ringo Starr may be more deserving of this honor. The incident 
required a "lung drain" and several days of hospitalization.

<b>Your Kidneys for the Jihad</b>
</font>
</center>
<p>
In the city of Mashhad, Iran, 508 people have signed up to 
sell one of their kidneys to provide funds for the assassination of 
Salmon Rushdie, author of <i>The Satanic Verses</i>. Iran had 
lifted the official <i>fatwa</i> decree on Rushdie, but there still 
remains a privately offered $2.8M reward for his head, plus 
these 508 kidneys. What we'd like to see: To have those 508 people
offer <b>both</b> kidneys, upping the reward to 1016.

<p>
After widely published warnings of terrorist packages from
Frankfurt Germany were broadcast, state police in Massachusetts
detonated an extremly dangerous box of chocolates found at
Cape Cod, Associated Press said. Under xray the assemblage 
appeared to be a bomb, but after detonation it was found to be 
a music box and sweets. No injuries but the chocolate was found 
to be a total loss.

An alert correspondent sent us these two alarming images, but was unable 
to provide any further information concerning the situation. If you did not 
receive gifts this year, perhaps this is the reason.

<b>Florida Electric Chair</b>
</font>
</center>
<p>
<tt>
From: Phildorex@aol.com<br>
Date: Sat, 25 Dec 1999 12:56:39 EST<br>
Subject: Allen Lee Davis execution<br>
</tt>
<p>

I enjoyed reading your page, which was recommended by a friend.  I wanted to 
correct some misinformation you had on your Allen Lee Davis electrocution 
page.  It is true that Florida continues to use the electric chair, but the 
one that zapped Davis this year was a new chair.  "Old Sparky", the chair 
that had executed all criminals in Florida since the 1920's, including Ted 
Bundy and Pedro Medina, was retired last year.  Davis was the first guest to 
get to sit in the new chair, "New Sparky", if you will.  
<p>

Incidentally, your argument that opponents of the death penalty help 
electrocutions continue is not entirely off-base.  Electrocutions are only 
performed in 4 of the 37 states which administer the death penalty.  The fact 
that electrocutions are so controversal actually slows up executions in those 
states.  Florida has nearly 500 inmates scheduled for execution, but only 
zaps two or three criminals a year.  Texas, on the other hand, also has 
approximately 500 inmates on death row and averages about 30 a year using 
lethal injection.  In fact, not only has Texas executed more criminals since 
the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1977, but Harris County, Texas 
alone has had more criminals executed than any other state all by itself.

<b>Clowns Remain Evil Menace</b>

<p>
<img src="bayer.jpg" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

Evil clown <b>Christopher Bayer</b> of Massapequa, New York was arrested
today for third degree sodomy (!) involving a sixteen year old boy. The boy's 
father videotaped the incident, after being suspicious of the clown's extra
special friendship with his son. The 27 year old clown, employed at Clyde 
Beatty-Cole Bros. Circus under the name <b>Smiley The Clown</b>, has been 
released from clown duties. It is unclear what the future of our beloved Smiley 
will be, whose interests range from balloon animals to pederasty.

<b>Monumentally Ugly Girl in Sex Caper</b>
</font>
</center>
<p>
<img src="jeffries.jpg" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

Normally, when an underage individual is charged with a sex crime,
photos of the suspect are not shown by the media. However, in this particular
instance, it was deemed necessary. We must agree. This 17 year old student from 
Phoenix's Moon Valley High School, Jessica Jeffries, was charged by a grand jury 
with eight counts of misconduct with a minor, molestation, and indecency. Two
twelve year old boys were the targets of her alleged love wiles, and apparently
these ungodly acts were apparently performed in front of a 7 year old girl.
Our only comment is, "Lordy, lordy, lordy."

<b>Boy George Nearly Assassinated by Disco Ball</b>
</font>
</center>
<p>
A disco ball fell on Boy George during rehearsal
at Bournemouth International Center in Dorset, UK, today.
The ball, weighing 62 pounds, bruised the extremely
homosexual singer and nearly killed him. While the
performer will recover, the disco ball was a complete loss.
Said Boy after the incident, "It would have been both 
ironic and glamorous to be finished off by a four-foot 
glitter ball." [Editor's note: We eagerly await an encore.]

Hi there,

We checked out your site, and it looks like you have a link that's not 
acceptable for the LinkExchange network. If you remove the link to 
rotten.com, you should be all set. Let us know when you've removed it, and 
we'll verify your account again. Thanks.
<p>

Please let me know if you have any more questions or concerns.

<b>Adolf Hitler Endorses Taiwanese Heaters</b>
</font>
</center>
<p>
<img src="hitlerad.jpg" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

A division of DBK, a German heating company, has been using the 
image of Adolf Hitler to advertise its products in Taiwan.
Above the nazi leader is the text, "Declare war on the cold front!"
While not causing undue concern on the mildly fascist island
of Taiwan, the parent company has been sent into a tizzy. But a local
company official stated to an AP reporter, "We decided to use 
Hitler because as soon as you see him, you think of Germany. It leaves 
a deep impression". The Fuhrer could not be reached for comment.
