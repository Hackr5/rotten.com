Former A's manager Dick Williams was charged January 17 with 
wanking outside his hotel room in Ft. Meyers, FL. Williams admits
being naked in the great outdoors but denies the masturbation
aspects of his arrest, although he did plea no contest to the
charges. Williams also feels that this may have cost him his chance 
to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame. Wanker.

A website that offered how-to information on date rape, and sold

Included in the kit was "Shut-the-Hell-Up-Bitch Duct Tape", and 
cookbooks of how to mix various daterape drugs with food and cocktails.
The people responsible for getting it shut down: wiley feminists,

<b>Will Suck Cock for Insider Stock Tips</b>

<table cellspacing=7 cellpadding=7>
<tr>
<td>
The former CEO of an investment banking firm, James McDermott, has been 
charged with giving insider stock tips to porno actress Kathryn Gannon. Late 
last week, federal prosecutors asked that the jury be made aware of Gannon's
career, but attorneys for the defendant argue that awareness by the jury
of said defendant's onscreen cocksucking prowess (under the moniker 
"Marylin Star") may be prejudicial. Diligent research by the rotten.com
staff has yielded that not only is Gannon a porn actress, but she is
also an inflatable doll ($69.95 plus $6.95 shipping and handling.) We can
only ask that the doll be introduced as evidence and assigned a ticker symbol.

Yesterday the Pope asked the world to forgive the sins of Catholics,
in a papal Day of Pardon. Said the Pope, "Even men of the church, in the 
name of faith and morals, have sometimes used methods not in keeping with 
the Gospel". No shit. Some of the sins of the Catholic Church include 
but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Condemning all Jews to hell in 1205 AD
<li>Granting indulgences to commit sin
<li>Worship and deification of saints
<li>The Crusades
<li>The Inquisition
<li>Extinguishing the Aztec culture
<li>Signing the Lateran Treaty with Benito Mussolini
<li>Collaboration with the Nazi government, and assisting with the 
escape of former Nazis after WWII
<li>Fostering the rampant spread of AIDS in Africa
<li>Graft, embezzlement, gluttony, and rampant greed
<li>Sodomy of countless altarboys
</ul>
<p>
Not very many organizations have this much blood on their hands. 
Now that we think about it, RICO charges may be in order.
Did I mention altarboys?

Candidates for regional councils in India, known as

<b>Beaver College Considers Change</b>

Beaver College, a former girls school founded in 1853, is
considering a name change because people have the audacity to

enrollment of 2800, discovered to its amazment in a survey 
that about 30% of prospective students dismiss the school
as a choice based on name alone.

Beaver, of course, is slang for part of the female anatomy,

Tuna A&M, the better off we all are.

Cardinal Giacomo Biffi, Archbishop of Bologna, stated on the 5th that

We should mention that Biffi is one of the leading candidates for
the Pope's see, once the current one dies. He should perhaps have his

<b>George W. Bush a Total Ignoramus</b>
</font>
</center>
<p>
<table cellspacing=7 cellpadding=7>
<tr>
<td>
So it turns out that presidential candidate George W. Bush is totally 
ignorant of things he certainly should know. Like, who is Prime Minister
of Canada. Now, it is not necessarily expected that you, as a private
citizen, should know who that is. But a Canadian show, <i>This Hour Has
22 Minutes</i> (they name their shows funny up there), asked Bush in
Michigan about Prime Minister <i>Jean Poutine</i>'s endorsement of him.
For the record, that's not the Prime Minister at all, it's a popular
french fry and cheese curd dish (they eat funny up there too.)
A presidential candidate should probably know who the Prime Minister of
our #1 trading partner is.

Another G.W. Bush quote we found, illuminating his great intellect:
<p>
<font color=brown>
"What I am against is quotas. I am against hard quotas, quotas they
basically delineate based upon whatever. However, they delineate, quotas,
I think vulcanise society. So I don't know how that fits into what
everybody else is saying, their relative positions, but that's my position".

A woman in Colwyn, near Philadelphia Pennsylvania, was the victim
of a March 3rd street knife attack and continued her shopping with a kitchen 
knife protruding from the back of her neck. The woman, 62, was unaware of
the situation until it was pointed out by her daughter. Video surveillance
tapes in the store clearly show the knife in the woman, who has since
been hospitalized in serious condition.

<b>Shitty Art Exhibit Alarms SF</b>

<table cellspacing=7 cellpadding=7>

Jonathan Yegge, student at the San Francisco Art Institute, exhibited
a bit of performace art as a school project. Even in San Francisco, it
is raising eyebrows. A volunteer was snarfed from one of his classes,
who signed a waiver/consent form, and then engaged in a public display
that perhaps seemed okay at the time:

<table cellspacing=10 cellpadding=10>
<tr>
<td>
"He was tied up. He had a blindfold and a gag, but he could see and talk
through it. He had freedom of movement of his pelvis. [...]
I engaged in oral sex with him and he engaged in oral sex with me. I 
had given him an enema, and I had taken a shit and stuffed it in his ass. 
That goes on, he shits all over me, I shit in him. There was a security 
guard present. There was an instructor from the school present. It was 
videoed, and the piece was over."

Yohei Ajimi, 13 year old Japanese schoolboy in Kyoto, suicided in front
of his classmates by leaping from a 2nd story window. His last words were
"I am going to die", and then he splatted 8.5 meters below. Quite a few
young students suicide in Japan, from shame or whatnot, but usually not
while in class. In all, almost 33,000 people engaged in the Japanese

Six men were arrested in Key West, Florida after they were

bareass naked and creating quite the ruckus when Pablo Rodriguez,
on duty at some nightclub (!), was informed of said ruckus, involving
his duty vehicle. The motive was apparently a "Japanese website",

<b>200,000 Web Porn Addicts Can't All Be Wrong</b>

A study at Stanford and Duquesne Universities claims that 
200,000 individuals in the U.S. are addicted to web pornography.
They defined "addicted" as being 11 or more hours per week
involved looking at dirty websites, being in filthy chatrooms,
etc etc. One must question their sampling technique -- surveys
were taken at MSNBC (yuck), and figures were pulled out of 
their asses to extrapolate the numbers of so-called "cybersex
compulsives" to a national level. As for the Rotten
Staff? 99th percentile, baby.

Details of the agreement between <i>Weight Watchers</i> and presidential
cocksucker Monica Lewinsky have been leaked in USA Today. Lewinsky was
paid $225K, plus $100K if she lost 20 pounds by September 1 1999, and
an additional $200K upon the loss of 20 more pounds. That comes to 
$7500 per pound, people. Theoretically she could receive nearly $1M if
target weight is maintained through June 15. Now assuming a blowjob
burns 360 calories per hour, ... [editor drifts off pondering this calculation]
