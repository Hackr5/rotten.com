<h2>rotten dot com CD ROM</h2>

<table width=400>
<tr>
<td>

We are publishing a CDROM containing many more images
than are present on the rotten.com website. It is the intent that the
images be <b>highly interesting</b> to our avid viewers.
<p>
All proceeds collected from the sale of these CDROM's will go
to two purposes: 
(1) provide funding for continuation of the rotten.com
website, which generates an extraordinary amount of traffic, about
2.5 GB per day at last count; and 
(2) acquisition of additional materials of a disturbing nature, for
both the website and future CDROM's.
<p>
If you are interested in possibly obtaining one of these discs, 
please let us know. Your name will not be given to anyone for any 
reason. And you do not have to leave an address: <b>All fields 
are optional,</b> do not fill out anything you are uncomfortable with.
<p>
It is necessary to collect prospective names in advance, so that
we can be assured of a reasonable price when minting the CDROM's. We
hope for about 250 names eventually.
<p>
<!--
<font color=red>
Availability: The CDROM is scheduled to be pressed in the first 
week of June, less than one month from now.

This system is not intended to and will never make a profit. 
However, with its use of bandwidth, and the cost of acquiring 
unusual materials, the money has to come from somewhere. This
would help us continue to provide our services without ugly
banners and whatnot.
