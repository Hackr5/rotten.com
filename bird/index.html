Dear rotten.com,

I am unsure if you are aware of the problems that your
"Incident with the bird" picture has caused on the
popular technology website slashdot
(http://slashdot.org).  Many users of this site's
messageboards are posting links to
http://smoke.rotten.com/bird and making text based
representations of a bird on a man's penis.  Frankly,
while I am pro-freedom, this type of photo sickens me.
 Could you please move the location of the bird page
 on your site to keep slashdot readers from seeing
 things that are completeley unrelated to computers and
 technology?  I'm not asking you to remove the content,
 just to relocate it.

 FYI the text representation of the bird is:

<table>
<tr><td>

 &lt; )

</td></tr>
</table>

with a link to the offensive site
(http://smoke.rotten.com/bird) underneath, these
"Penis Birds" are posted by Penis Bird Guy, Penis Bird
MAN and several other users

Regards,
Andrew J. Tosh
