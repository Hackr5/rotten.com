Silent film actor Rudolph Valentino died August 23, 1926, age 31, from 
complications due to surgery to repair a perforated ulcer. Rudolph was
one of the premiere stars of the day, and was given the nickname 
"The Great Lover", though largely undeserved. Riots occurred in New York 
City amongst those who were trying to view his body.
