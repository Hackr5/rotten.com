Jason Thirsk, former bassist for the hardcore punk band Pennywise,
was found dead at his Hermosa Beach home on July 29 1996, aged 27. He had been 
battling depression and alcoholism (the reason he was removed from the band.) 
Somewhat later, <i>All Star Magazine</i> reported that "some sick fans 
got hold of the suicide photos" and the band was attempting to have them 
somehow removed from the Internet.
