<h3>Lincoln's Box at Ford's Theatre</h3>

<p>

Lincoln attended Ford's Theatre to view the play "Our American Cousin". 
Seven hours before the assassination, John Wilkes Booth left a note at
Vice President Andrew Johnson's residence, "Don't wish to disturb you. 
Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth."

<h3>Lincoln is Shot</h3>

<p>

<font size=-1>Account by William Cullen Bryant:</font>
<p>

After Booth shot Lincoln he lept on the stage from Lincoln's box, breaking his leg. 
As he ran from the stage, some heard Booth shout <i>sic semper tyrannus</i> , which is 
Latin for "thus always to tyrants". Others in the audience thought he shouted "The 
South is avenged!". Booth ran backstage, and being famliar with the theatre where he 
had acted, made his way downstairs and out the back door where he had a horse waiting 
for him in the back alley-way. One year previous to this fateful event, Booth, who 
was a leading Shakespeare actor of his time, played in Julius Caesar, in which 
after the assassination of Caesar one of the assassins, said "How many times shall 
this, our lofty scene be acted o'er, in states unborn and accents yet unknown?" The 
scene was acted o'er again, only this time it was real and Booth was the perpetrator 
and Lincoln the victim. When Lincoln passed away at 7:22 am on April 15, his 
Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, standing at Lincoln's bedside, said "Now he 
belongs to the ages."

<h3>Lincoln's Body Lies in State</h3>

<p>

Lincoln died April 15, 1865 at 7:22 AM. Here his body lies in state at
the East Room of the White House, where it remained until his funeral on
April 19. Lincoln's tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetary, Springfield IL, was built 
in 1871, where thieves attempted to steal the body in 1876 for ransom. 
In the early 20th century the tomb was redesigned to prevent a recurrence.

<p>

July 7, 1865, the Lincoln conspirators prepare to hang. Booth escaped hanging; he 
was killed April 26 by the slightly looney Sgt. Boston Corbett, a man who had 
<i>castrated himself</i> to protect himself from sin.

<h3>The Morbid Curse of Robert Todd Lincoln?</h3>

<p>

Robert Todd Lincoln, the president's oldest son, was at Lincoln's side when he
passed away in 1865. Years later, as Secretary of War, Todd Lincoln was present
and ready to meet President James A Garfield, when Garfield was assassinated. And, 
when Todd Lincoln entered the Pan-American Exposition Hall in Buffalo, NY, 
President William McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist.
