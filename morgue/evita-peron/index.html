Evita Peron died July 26, 1952, of uterine cancer in Buenos Aires.
Her body was stolen by anti-Peronistas in 1955 and hidden in
Italy until 1971. In 1974, Evita's remains were returned
to Argentina for burial in the presidential crypt. But two
years following that, they were transferred to lie beneath
several protective layers of steel in the Duarte family's tomb,
at Recoleta cemetery in Buenos Aires.
