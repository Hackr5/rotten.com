Andrew Cunanan, at the time wanted for questioning over
five murders, shot and killed fashion designer Gianni Versace
in front of Versace's Miami home. Part of the mystique involved
in the search for Cunanan was due to the fact that the FBI
released so many pictures of him, at varying stages of his life.
The media morphed him into some type of master of disguise, 
which he clearly was not. Cunanan suicided July 23, 1997 on a
houseboat in Miami.
