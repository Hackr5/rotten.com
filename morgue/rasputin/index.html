The body of the Russian monk and favorite to the czarina, Grigori 
Efimovich Rasputin (1872-1916). On December 30, 1916, a plot to 
assassinate Rasputin transpired. The monk drank several glasses 
of poisoned wine, and consumed several pastries with potassium 
cyanide as an active ingredient. When this failed to stop Rasputin, 
he was shot by Prince Felix Yusupov, shot again, stabbed repeatedly, 
and finally met his end drowned in the icy Neva river. There are 
stories that Rasputin's penis was severed from his body prior to his demise, 
but we believe those to be false.
