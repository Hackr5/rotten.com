"A single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic."
<p>

Josef Stalin died on March 5, 1953 of a brain hemorrhage. That's
the official story. Some say that KGB chief Lavrenti Beria may
have been responsible for poisoning the dictator. In any event, 
the funeral for Stalin, who killed so many millions of soviets,
was attended by so many people that some were trampled to death
in the chaos.
<p>

Stalin's body was embalmed and placed next to Lenin's in the
tomb at Red Square. But in 1961, with Stalin falling into disgrace,
the corpse was quietly removed and buried.
