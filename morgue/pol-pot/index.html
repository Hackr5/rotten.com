Pol Pot, the Cambodian dictator and leader of the Khmer Rouge, 
was responsible for the deaths of 1.5 million. His activities
concerning the extermination of 20% of the Cambodian population
inspired the award winning movie, <i>The Killing Fields</i>. 
Pot died at age 73 on April 15, 1998, after several years of ill 
health. The U.S. was planning to arrest Pot and deport him for 
a war crimes trial. Oddly, by many accounts, in person he 
was a nice guy.
