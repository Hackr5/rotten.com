Marilyn Monroe was found dead from an overdose of sleeping pills
on August 5, 1962, by her housekeeper Eunice Murray. She was naked,
atop her telephone on her bed, with unhealthy levels of barbiturates 
in her bloodstream. But the typical signs of barbiturate overdose
were completely absent.
<p>

Supposedly, Monroe had had an abortion at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital 
on the 20th of July. It has been said that she had as many as a dozen 
abortions over the years. But certainly it is well known that she 
was terminated by her job at Fox Studio. And there were problems with
her relationship with Robert F Kennedy; he was not returning her calls.
<p>

Evidence is missing, including the original autopsy, her supposed
suicide note (which mentioned suicide not at all), and original police
report. Furthermore, the first officer at the death scene has 
publicly disputed the suicide finding.
<p>

In 1985, a 20/20 episode was to air where Robert Slatzer postulates
that Monroe was killed by Bobby Kennedy, or was in his presence
when she died. The show is cancelled.
<p>

Marilyn is buried at Westwood Memorial Cemetery.
