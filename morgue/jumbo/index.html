P.T. Barnum's prize elephant <b>Jumbo</b> was killed
September 15, 1885, crossing railroad tracks in St. Thomas,
Ontario. The collision derailed the train, and 150 people 
were required to haul the elephant's body up an embankment.
<p>

Jumbo's death was a great loss to Barnum's show, but the
loss was somewhat mitigated when both the taxidermied hide
of the beast and its skeleton were exhibited together.

Vital statistics: height 11.5 feet, weight 6.5 tons, age 24
