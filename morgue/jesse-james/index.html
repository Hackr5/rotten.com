Jesse James is believed to be responsible for the first daylight bank
robbery in the United States. Over the span of 16 years, the James-Younger
gang committed 26 holdups in ten states, leaving 14 dead.
<p>

On April 3, 1882, at the James residence at 1318 Lafayette Street, St.
Joseph Missouri, Bob Ford shot and killed April 3, 1882, by a bullet to the back 
of the head. Although he killed James to collect the $10,000 reward, Ford was 
charged with murder and sentenced to hang. He was eventually pardoned and 
died in a bar brawl.
