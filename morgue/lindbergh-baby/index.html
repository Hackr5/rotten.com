<p>

On March 1, 1932, an unknown person kidnaps Lindbergh's son, aged 20 
months, from their residence in Hopewell, New Jersey. The child had been
sleeping since 7:30 PM, and discovered missing at 10:00 PM. But
a mere two months prior, Charles Lindbergh played a prank on
the household where he pretended the child was kidnapped. This time
however, the threat was real, and a ransom note was discovered 
on the windowsill of the nursery.

affair out of this, or to get your baby back as soon as possible to settle 
those affair in a quick way will be better for both -- don't be afraid about
the baby -- keeping care of us day and night. We also will feed him 
acording to the diet. 
<p>

aus for 50000$ but now we have to take another person to it and probably 
have to keep the baby for a longer time as we expected. So the amound 
will be 70000 20000 in 50$ bills 25000$ in 20$ bill 15000$ in 10$ bills 
and 10000 in 5$ bills Don't mark any bills or take them from one serial 
nomer. We will form you latter were to deliver the mony. But we will note do

<h3>Discovery</h3>

<p>

A ransom of $50,000 is paid in gold certificates. This excuse is used 
by President Roosevelt to recall <i>all</i> gold certificates everywhere 
in the U.S., on punishment of ten year jail sentence. Oh, what conspiracy
hath necessity wrought! But then..
<p>

May 12 1932, the decomposed and animal-eaten body of Lindbergh's son 
is discovered by truck driver William Allen, about two miles from the
family home. Cause of death was apparently a fractured skull, and 
Lindbergh identified the body though a birth defect of one of the toes.
The aviator ordered the body cremated, without a full autopsy.

<h3>Hauptmann</h3>

<p>

Bruno Richard Hauptmann, an illegal German immigrant, was
arrested on September 19, 1934 with a ransom bill on his person. 
Furthermore he had hidden in his garage $14,000 of the 
Lindbergh ransom money. Though he denied all involvement, and 
the evidence on him is shaky at best, he was convicted in
a circus atmosphere and executed on April 3, 1936 in Trenton, NJ.
