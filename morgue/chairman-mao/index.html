Mao Tse Tung died in September 1976, and 1,000,000 people attended his
funeral in Tiananmen Square. Mao's remains are currently housed in a granite 
edifice, within a crystal sarcophagus. The tomb was closed in April 1997, 
and has yet to reopen, apparently due to poor vibes with regard to its 
geometric placement in accordance with ancient Chinese traditions.
