A rather hasty military autopsy was performed on Kennedy's body
at Bethesda. Furthermore, images were taken that were later tampered
with, muddling things even more. We've tried to include only
photographs we believe to be actual autopsy images from the president.

<h3>Top View</h3>

<img src="kennedy-top.jpg">
<p>

The view of the top of Kennedy's head. It is readily apparent that
a large portion of the skull is missing, and brain matter is exposed.
(There is another series of photos that purports to depict the
autopsy, with this area intact.)

<h3>Right Side</h3>

<img src="kennedy-side.jpg">
<p>

A color view of the right side of Kennedy's head, showing brain
matter. When published, this picture is usually shown in black and white.
Damage is quite extensive, more than is indicated by some of the
earlier theories.

<h3>Back</h3>

<img src="kennedy-back.jpg">
<p>

Photo of the president's back, oddly taken from below the body.
The Warren Commission's report located this wound at the back of the neck,
though you can clearly see that the wound is to the back.
<p>

<h3>Left Side</h3>

<img src="kennedy-left.jpg">
<p>

Left view of the head. Injuries are not visible from this angle.
<p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Front View</h3>

<img src="kennedy-front.jpg">
<p>

Front of the president. The entry wound (and it is an entry wound) is
obscured by his tracheotomy. Of course, giving him a tracheotomy when much
of his brain was missing was futile.
