To the left, a 1995 publicity still showing Kurt Cobain mocking suicide. 
This was taken quite some time prior to his death, which was 
accomplished with a shotgun rather than a semiautomatic rifle.
<p>
In his later life, Kurt was plagued by intense stomach pain, 
one of the reasons he relied so much on drugs. Not an attempt to
justify drug use, just his answer to the pain.
<p>
Four weeks before his death, Cobain attempted suicide in Italy, leaving
him in a temporary coma, widely reported in the media at the time.

<h3>Suicide</h3>

<p>

Kurt Cobain's body was discovered on April 8, 1994 by electrician
Gary Smith, who was to install a burglar alarm in the residence.
It is likely he killed himself on April 5. Heroin and valium both
were found in his blood. The shotgun blast destroyed his head
to the point where he was not recognizable; the body was identified
from fingerprints. Cobain was 27. 
<p>

Word spread quickly. MTV took the unprecedented step of ceasing 
all normal programming. An outdoor vigil in Seattle witnessed the 
playback of Cobain's suicide note, recorded by his wife Courtney
Love. One fan killed himself after this event. Several others scattered
about the country also followed.
