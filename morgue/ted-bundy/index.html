Clean-cut serial killer Theodore "Ted" Bundy confessed to 28 killings, but other
estimates indicate that he killed as many as 33 to 100 female victims during the 
1970's. Often he sexually assaulted his victims with such instruments as crowbars 
or hairspray bottles. While under arrest, Bundy managed to escape twice,
one time living for months on the run in Tallahassee.

Bundy, a law student at one time, served as his own attorney, but his smooth
talking was not able to escape a sentence of death.

Ted Bundy was executed January 24, 1989. The hundreds of people holding a vigil 
outside the prison held up signs such as "Burn Bundy Burn", and celebrated once 
news of his death was announced.
