<h3>Corpse</h3>

<p>

Dillinger escaped from prison on March 3, 1934, from an
escape-proof cell using a wooden gun he fashioned. After 
resuming his chosen career, and evading an FBI ambush in
which two agents were accidentally killed, J. Edgar Hoover 
named Dillinger Public Enemy #1. But the FBI shot him 
on July 22 at a north Chicago movie theatre.

After this photo was distributed, tales of John Dillinger's
legendary manhood spread. There are apocryphal stories of owning his
severed organ, keeping it in a box, etc. People: That's the
gangster's <i>arm</i>, in rigor mortis.
