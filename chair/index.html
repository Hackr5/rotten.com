The electric chair is still used in the United States for
the purposes of execution. Ironically, it is the inaction of
the very people who oppose capital punishment, the ACLU and 
similar groups, that cause this practice to continue. These
groups feel that taking a stand towards lethal injection
would taint their overall opposition to the death penalty.

Ruth Snyder's execution, and the recent botched execution
of Allen Lee Davis in Florida this year.
