On July 8 1999, murderer Allen Lee Davis was executed on
the Florida electric chair "Old Sparky". Davis' face was bloodied
and photographs taken, which were later released by the
Florida Supreme Court.

Florida only offers execution via the chair, and thus after
the publicity following this execution, inmate Thomas Provensano 
filed suit claiming cruel and unusual punishment. On August 2,
a judge ruled this argument ineligible to stay his execution.

Previously, on March 24 1999, during the execution of Pedro
Medina on the same chair, twelve inch flames were seen to erupt
from the face and head of Medina, and the stench of burnt
flesh was evident after the execution. No photos are available
from that execution, but these of Davis's are quite vivid.
