<font size="-1">
buy something terribly awful for your loved or unloved ones
</font>
<p>
</center>

You may have noticed there there are 
<font size=+1><b>no banners</b></font> on rotten.com, anywhere.
Money to support this repulsive site comes from viewers such as 
yourself, and from the pockets of the rotten staff.
<p>
This site is costing a terrible amount of money to maintain. 
Transfers are totalling several gigabytes per day now, and are 
constantly growing. About 30,000 visitors per day stop by. 
If you ask your local ISP how much to host a site that transfers
about 5GB/day, they'll probably quote you a number in the
thousands per month. And that's if they would even host it.
<p>
So, if you are offended and infuriated by rotten dot com,
hold your nose, open your checkbook and send us something, and we'll 
send you something.

For $16, an <b><font color=red size="+1">ancient roman coin</font></b>. 
A bronze coin from the late imperial period of the Roman Empire, 
in nice condition -- not one of those klunky junk coins sold in
cheesy comic book advertisements. About 1500 years old.
<p>
For $32, a <b><font color=red size="+1">cranial burr</font></b>, 
commonly known as a skull drill. A wicked looking medical tool to use to 
burrow into someone's head. Never used, unfortunately.
<p>
For $32, a copy of <b><font color=red size=+1>Triumph of the Will</font></b>,
the infamous Nazi propaganda film by Leni Riefenstahl. It is perhaps
one of the most compelling movies made, in any time. New, in shrinkwrap.
<a href="triumph.html">[photo]</a>.

For $32, a package of eight vintage <b><font color=red size=+1>bondage 
photos</font></b> from the 1950's to 1960's. The package will be randomly 
selected and will usually be in their original packaging. These are 
vile, amateur skanky photos, 4"x5" black & whites of women tied up, being 
spanked, etc. But done with artistic flair! These images are on one of 
our upcoming CD ROM's -- this is your chance to own the original source 
material. A very good deal at this price, these usually sell at twice 
the price. Must be a connoisseur age 18 or older.

For $64, a <b><font color=red size="+1">meteorite</font></b>,
tektite type meteorite found in Thailand's Korat Plateau. Theory
is that these glassy molten nodules (sporting various aerodynamic
shapes) struck earth after a larger meteorite created the
crater Tycho on the moon. I will include documentation.
<p>
For $90, <b><font color=red size="+1">Rorschach test cards</font></b>, 
such that you can administer psychiatric evaluations of your friends 
and fellow unstable rotten.com viewers. These are full sets of vintage 
cards on very thick stock and were surplussed by the US military. 
Vintage late 1950's to early 1960's. Photo of the 
<a href="rorschach.jpg">title page</a> from the card sets. Only 
a few of these are available.
<p>
For $120, <b><font color=red size="+1">human femur</font></b>.
Yes, it's perfectly legal! Don't call the police! This human thigh 
bone comes from an anatomical specimen and not from my most 
recent murder victim. It was purchased legally and I have appropriate
documenation for you law enforcement officials reading this. 
Gift wrap available.
<p>
For $128, <b><font color=red size="+1">ushabti</font></b>. A small
(about 3.5" high) egyptian mummiform figure constructed of blue-green
faiance and buried as a servant for the dead. Late Kingdom, 700BC 
or so. I only have a few of these.

We thank you for your support. It costs about $400 to $500 per
month to keep this site going, with all the traffic it's generating.
So every little bit helps. (Bigger bits help more, of course,
but little bits are better than no bits. I'm rambling.)
<p>
Personal check or money order is sufficient. Please notify me
via <a href="mailto:publicity@rotten.com">e-mail</a> if you want 
to obtain something on the above list over $100.
