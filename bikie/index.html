On 2 September 1984 two motorcycle "bikie" clubs, the <a href="bikiej2.html">
Comanchero's</a> and the <a href="bikiej1.html">Bandido's</a>, escalated
their rivalry into open warfare. The place chosen was the "Viking Tavern" 
in Milperra, a suburb of Sydney, NSW, Australia.

The carpark of the tavern was filled with members of the
"British Motorcycle Club" as well as members of the public who had gathered
for a "swap-meet" hosted by the BMC.

Swap-meets were considered neutral ground by the two clubs.
Most of the dead bikers were upper eschelon in the two clubs making
it apparent that they were specifically targeted.
