<b>Mattel v. Rotten</b>
</font>
<p>
We registered <b>matell.com</b> (a name similar to, but not used by 
Mattel Toy Corporation) and pointed it to rotten.com's page. This did 
not sit well with Mattel, when unsuspecting people looking for pages about 
Barbie Dolls were finding decapitations and whatnot. And incredibly,
Mattel was concerned customers would confuse our website with theirs!

<b>FOTM Winner!</b>
</font>
<p>
This woman's face was allegedly pasted onto the top of the face of
one of our "Fuck of the Month" winners.  Even so, our judges have
determined that this woman is still entitled to her Fuck of the
Month Award, if indeed she wishes to claim it.

<b>RSAC Ratings</b>
</font>
<p>
About a year ago a tag was placed on rotten.com's front page rating
it at "Disney" level. This letter claims we entered into some manner
of contract (outright lie) and that somehow their trademark protection
extends to an instance where we explicitly state that they have
not endorsed our rating (second outright lie).

<b>Loser Meets Train</b>
</font>
<p>
The case of a family claiming that a photo on one of our pages
is their nephew. Apparently the nephew lay his head in front of
a train. Our analysis was inconclusive.

Uni**d M*dia clamps d*wn on r*tten, over the par*dies of

otherwise offensive epis*des.

Again with the pointy haired lawyers. This time they don't like us

<b>Achtung Bissen</b>
</font>
<p>
The Jewish <i>Anti-Defamation League</i>
is upset at a picture we posted which has nothing at 
all to do with Jewry or the Holocaust. Their complaint
is that it <i>reminds</i> them of the Holocaust. 
Anyway we fully expect them to narq to Pillsbury about this.

The Mastercard Corporation doesn't seem to realize the
definition of <i>parody</i>. Like, when we make fun of someone's
advertising campaign, it's parody. And stuff. What asses.

<b>FOTM Winner #2</b>
</font>
<p>
This one is a case of mistaken identity. Apparently
because the "model" looks like some girl, it therefore
must be her face pasted on the picture! Never mind that
the portrait of her face is taken at an angle unique
to porn, and she has her "Gene Simmons" tongue hanging out..

<b>Futurama Porn</b>
</font>
<p>
<p>
Ok, maybe the <b>Futurama</b> porn wasn't such a good idea.
Futurama is a somewhat popular Fox television show. This might
be covered by parody, but we aren't exactly Mad magazine.

<b>Bonsai Kitten</b>
</font>
<p>
<p>
Hundreds of people complain about the Bonsai Kitten site that
we host, to the UK Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals. Never mind that no cruelty occurred either in the
creation of the website or as a result from it. They <i>think</i>
they see kitties being abused and therefore the site must be
eradicated. The word <i>hoax</i> does not exist in their dictionary.

<b>Coca-Cola</b>

<p>
"It has come to our attention that your Rotten.com and Fuqqer.com websites depict
as the March, 2000 "Fuck of the Month" a picture of a Coca-Cola bottle inserted into
a woman's anus. Needless to say, this image is not consistent with the goodwill and
reputation that The Coca-Cola Company has striven over many years to associate
with its trademarks."
