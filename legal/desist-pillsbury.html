<b>Part I. Cause</b>

Pillsbury took objection to our having a depiction of the
"doughboy holocaust" -- a doughboy alive but cooking in an oven, 
with a wistful expression looking at his fallen comrades
outside, already cooked.

Image was removed, though they don't really have a case.
Allegations of "unfair competition" are ridiculous -- in what
business are we supposedly competing with them? Furthermore, 
use of even a trademark is allowed in some circumstances,
such as parody or satire. 
<p>
Anyway we don't even know who did this picture, it came 
to us through sources long forgotten. But we bet the Jewish 
ADL tipped off Pillsbury.
