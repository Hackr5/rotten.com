<b>Part I. Cause</b>

About a year ago a tag was placed on rotten.com's front page rating
it at "Disney" level. The action was then promptly forgotten until this
certified letter arrived.

<b>Part II. Conclusion</b>

The letter claims we entered into some manner of contract, breaking
the "terms of agreement" specified on their website. This is an outright 
lie. We've never visited their website. The META tag from Disney's site 
was merely pasted in and modified. 
<p>

Furthermore, the letter claims trademark violation, but we state 
in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS that our rating was not endorsed by RSAC. It was 
merely made compatible with it. This would be equivalent to Netscape 
suing Microsoft for sending "Mozilla/Compatible" as their browser 
identifier -- which they do -- and for which nobody has even raised
the slightest stink over. What fucknuts, this RSAC.
<p>

We don't care much for ratings systems. The internet was not created
for children, and there's no reason to turn it over to them now.
