<b>Part I. Cause</b>

</center>

A series of 17 rude parodies involving the United Media character
"Dilbert" are posted. The strip characters are involved in various
homoerotic escapades, sexual harrassments, and racist roundtable.
<p>

There was a disclaimer at the beginning stating these were parody, with
strip clearly labelled as being not under the approval of United Media.
Nobody could ever assume these were officially sanctioned 
representations of Dilbert.

<b>Part II. Conclusion</b>
</font>

We believe we're in the legal right on this one. Mad magazine, for
instance, published a Dilbert parody, and others exist on the net. Apparently,
these are singled out because of the things the characters are saying.
And admittedly, they are foul mouthed.
<p>

Fair use of copyright includes the right of parody. This right is not 
negated because the person being parodied does not approve of the end work.
That's the whole point behind the idea of parody itself, and the reason
that fair use exists. Otherwise, parody could never exist.
<p>

Nonetheless, the parodies have been removed, there being other battles to fight.
